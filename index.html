The dig is at an undisturbed Royal Tomb, a true find--and an irresistible temptation for art thieves, jealous colleagues, looters, the press, and the countless evil-doers. As Ramses and Nefret rub elbows with thieves and thugs, Amelia finds herself faced with a surprising new villain who is every bit as clever and resourceful as the intrepid Amelia herself.</p><p>What could be more intriguing to Amelia Peabody and her irresistible, irascible husband, Emerson (&#34;the Father of Curses&#34;), than meeting a masked stranger who offers to show them an Egyptian queen&#39;s lost tomb? The mysterious disappearance of that midnight visitor before he can disclose the secret! Thus begins Amelia&#39;s newest adventure along the Nile. Helped, or hampered, by two teenagers, their son, Ramses, and their beautiful ward, Nefret, the Emersons set sail for Thebes to find the hidden tomb of Queen Tetisheri. With them is a timid (or is she?) governess named Miss Marmaduke. Soon to join the expedition are Amelia&#39;s sister- and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Walter, whose marriage is going through a rocky patch. As usual, archaeology is only one of Amelia&#39;s concerns, as the Emersons encounter murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient Egyptian curses. The tomb, of course, will hold a stunning surprise. And the Hippopotamus Pool? It&#39;s an ancient Egyptian story of war and wits that Amelia is translating... and that alerts her to a hippo of a different stripe: a nefarious, overweight art dealer who may become her next archenemy. Or perhaps not - for another nemesis is lurking under the Saharan sun, a master of disguises, a caliph of crime, a veritable vizier of villainy. Will Amelia meet her match?<b>Elizabeth Peters</b> was born and brought up in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute.

But when she learns that the Heartbreaker has already broken into her home and watched her sleep, she reluctantly agrees to Nick's protection, even if it means that she's thrown together with her brother's all-too-sexy friend all day--and all night.

She has written two award-winning literary novels. <i>The Couple Next Door</i> was her suspense debut.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>On this hot August night, Tom Krupp parks his car&#x2013;a leased Lexus&#x2013;in the driveway of his handsome two-story home. The house, complete with a two-car garage, is set behind a generous lawn and framed with beautiful old trees. To the right of the driveway, a flagstone path crosses in front of the porch, with steps leading up to a solid wooden door in the middle of the house. To the right of the front door is a large picture window the width of the living room.<br><br>The house sits on a gently curving street that ends in a cul-de-sac. The surrounding houses are all equally attractive and well maintained, and relatively similar. People who live here are successful and settled; everyone's a little bit smug.<br><br>This quiet, prosperous suburb in upstate New York, populated with mostly professional couples and their families, seems oblivious to the problems of the small city that surrounds it, oblivious to the problems of the larger world, as if the American dream has continued to live on here, smooth and unruffled.<br><br>But the untroubled setting does not match Tom's current state of mind. He cuts the lights and the engine and sits uneasily for a moment in the dark, despising himself.<br><br>Then, with a start, he notices that his wife's car is not in its usual place in the driveway. He automatically checks his watch: 9:20. He wonders if he's forgotten something. Was she going out? He can't remember her mentioning anything, but he's been so busy lately. Maybe she just went out to run an errand and will be back any minute. She's left the lights on; they give the house a welcoming glow.<br><br>He gets out of the car into the summer night&#x2013;it smells of freshly mown grass&#x2013;swallowing his disappointment. He wanted, rather fervently, to see his wife. He stands for a moment, his hand on the roof of the car, and looks across the street. Then he grabs his briefcase and suit jacket from the passenger seat and tiredly closes the car door. He walks along the path, up the front steps, and opens the door. Something is wrong. He holds his breath.<br><br>Tom stands completely still in the doorway, his hand resting on the knob. At first he doesn't know what's bothering him. Then he realizes what it is. The door wasn't locked. That in itself isn't unusual-most nights he comes home and opens the door and walks right in, because most nights Karen's home, waiting for him. But she's gone out with her car and forgotten to lock the door. That's very odd for his wife, who's a stickler about locking the doors. He slowly lets out his breath. Maybe she was in a rush and forgot.<br><br>His eyes quickly take in the living room, a serene rectangle of pale gray and white. It's perfectly quiet; there's obviously no one home. She left the lights on, so she must not have gone out for long. Maybe she went to get some milk. There will probably be a note for him. He tosses his keys onto the small table by the front door and heads straight for the kitchen at the back of the house. He's starving. He wonders if she's already eaten or whether she's been waiting for him.<br><br>It's obvious that she's been preparing their supper. A salad is almost finished; she has stopped slicing mid-tomato. He looks at the wooden cutting board, at the tomato and the sharp knife lying beside it. There's pasta on the granite counter, ready to be cooked, a large pot of water on the stainless steel gas stove. The stove is off and the water in the pot is cold; he dips a finger in to check. He scans the refrigerator door for a note-there's nothing written on the whiteboard for him. He frowns. He pulls his cell phone out of his pants pocket and checks to see if there's any message from her that he might have missed. Nothing. Now he's mildly annoyed. She might have told him.<br><br>Tom opens the door to the refrigerator and stands there for a minute, staring sightlessly at its contents, then grabs an imported beer and decides to start the pasta. He's sure she'll be home any minute. He looks around curiously to see what they might have run out of. They have milk, bread, pasta sauce, wine, parmesan cheese. He checks the bathroom-there's plenty of toilet paper. He can't think of anything else that might be urgent. While he waits for the water to come to a boil, he calls her cell, but she doesn't pick up.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, the pasta is ready, but there is no sign of his wife. Tom leaves the pasta in the strainer in the sink, turns off the burner under the pot of tomato sauce, and wanders restlessly into the living room, his hunger forgotten. He looks out the large picture window across the lawn to the street beyond. Where the hell is she? He's starting to get anxious now. He calls her cell again and hears a faint vibration coming from behind him. He whips his head toward the sound and sees her cell phone, vibrating against the back of the sofa. Shit. She forgot her phone. How can he reach her now?<br><br>He starts looking around the house for clues as to where she might have gone. Upstairs, in their bedroom, he's surprised to find her bag sitting on her bedside table. He opens it with clumsy fingers, faintly guilty about going through his wife's purse. It feels private. But this is an emergency. He dumps the contents onto the middle of their neatly made bed. Her wallet is there, her change purse, lipstick, pen, a tissue packet-it's all there. Not an errand then. Maybe she stepped out to help a friend? An emergency of some kind? Still, she would have taken her purse with her if she was driving the car. And wouldn't she have called him by now if she could? She could borrow someone else's phone. It's not like her to be thoughtless.<br><br>Tom sits on the edge of the bed, quietly unraveling. His heart is beating too fast. Something is wrong. He thinks that maybe he should call the police. He considers how that might go. My wife went out and I don't know where she is. She left without her phone and her purse. She forgot to lock the door. It's completely unlike her. They probably won't take him seriously if she's been gone such a short time. He hasn't seen any sign of a struggle. Nothing is out of place.<br><br>Suddenly he gets up off the bed and rapidly searches the entire house. But he finds nothing alarming&#x2013;no phone knocked off the hook, no broken window, no smear of blood on the floor. Even so, he's breathing as anxiously as if he had.<br><br>He hesitates. Perhaps the police will think they've had an argument. It won't matter if he tells them there was no argument, if he tells them they almost never argue. That theirs is an almost perfect marriage.<br><br>Instead of calling the police, he runs back into the kitchen, where Karen keeps a list of phone numbers, and starts calling her friends.<br><br>-<br><br>Looking at the wreckage in front of him, Officer Kirton shakes his head in resignation. People and cars. He's seen things to make his stomach empty itself on the spot. It wasn't that bad this time.<br><br>There'd been no identification on the crash victim, a woman, probably early thirties. No purse, no wallet. But the vehicle registration and insurance had been in the glove compartment. The car is registered to a Karen Krupp, at 24 Dogwood Drive. She'll have some explaining to do. And some charges to face. For now, she's been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital.<br><br>As far as he can figure, and according to witnesses, she was traveling like a bat out of hell. She ran a red light and smashed the red Honda Civic right into a pole. It's a miracle no one else was hurt.<br><br>She was probably high, Kirton thinks. They would get a tox screen on her.<br><br>He wonders if the car was stolen. Easy enough to find out.<br><br>Thing was, she didn't look like a car thief or a druggie. She looked like a housewife. As far as he could tell through all that blood.<br><br>-<br><br>Tom Krupp has called the people he knows Karen sees most often. If they don't know where she might be, then he isn't waiting any longer. He's calling the police.<br><br>His hand trembles as he picks up the phone again. He feels sick with fear.<br><br>A voice comes on the line, "911. Where's your emergency?"<br><br>As soon as he opens the door and sees the cop on his doorstep, his face serious, Tom knows something very bad has happened. He is filled with a nauseating dread.<br><br>"I'm Officer Fleming," the cop says, showing his badge. "May I come in?" he asks respectfully, in a low voice.<br><br>"You got here fast," Tom says. "I just called 911 a few minutes ago." He feels as if he might be going into shock.<br><br>"I'm not here because of a 911 call," the officer says.<br><br>Tom leads him into the living room and collapses onto the large white sofa as if his legs have given out, not looking at the officer's face. He wants to delay the moment of truth for as long as possible.<br><br>But that moment has come. He finds that he can hardly breathe.<br><br>"Put your head down," Officer Fleming says, and places his hand gently on Tom's shoulder.<br><br>Tom leans his head toward his lap, feeling like he's going to pass out. He fears that his world is coming to an end. After a moment he looks up. He has no idea what's coming next, but he knows it can't be good.</p><h2>The God That Failed</h2><p><p> <i>The God That Failed</i> is a classic work and crucial document of the Cold War that brings together essays by six of the most important writers of the twentieth century on their conversion to and subsequent disillusionment with communism. In describing their own experiences, the authors illustrate the fate of leftism around the world. Andr� Gide (France), Richard Wright (the United States), Ignazio Silone (Italy), Stephen Spender (England), Arthur Koestler (Germany), and Louis Fischer, an American foreign correspondent, all tell how their search for the betterment of humanity led them to communism, and the personal agony and revulsion which then caused them to reject it. David Engerman's new foreword to this central work of our time recounts the tumultuous events of the era, providing essential background. It also describes the book's origins and impact, the influence of communism in American intellectual life, and how the events described in <i>The God That Failed</i> continue to affect public discourse today.</p></p><p>This classic work and crucial document of the Cold War brings together essays by six of the most important writers of the twentieth century, including Andr� Gide, Richard Wright, Ignazio Silone, Stephen Spender, Arthur Koestler, and Louis Fischer, on their conversion to and subsequent disillusionment with communism.

Dr Sinclair is the author of Mindfulness for Busy People (Pearson) and the co-author of The Little CBT Workbook (Crimson).I just loved reading this book. It is so practical in its organization and written in everyday language that is easy to understand. The authors systematically teach three core ideas which are at the heart of ACT: wake up, loosen up and step up. In each section, they provide numerous, easy to follow daily strategies to help increase your ability to be in the present moment, to practise detachment when you are in troubled waters, and to live your life guided by what really matters to you. The case examples used to highlight key concepts are really well done. The authors have succeeded at their goal of making ACT refreshingly simple to understand and utilize in daily life.

You'll learn how to wake up, loosen up and step up to create a richer, fuller, more meaningful life. An excellent addition to your ACT library. (Dr. Russ Harris, Author of ACT Made Simple and The Happiness Trap)<br><br>The Little ACT Workbook is a wonderful introduction to how to succeed in life. Based on clear scientific principles and evidence, it may surprise, intrigue, amuse, or inspire. It will ask you to look at your circumstance in an entirely different way than you have done before. What you will see is that our goals and our difficulties are connected, our own thoughts are as likely to help as to mislead, and one sure way to lose is to refuse to participate. What you will do is up to you. (Lance M. McCracken, Ph.D. Professor of Behavioural Medicine, King's College London)<br><br>The Little ACT Workbook by Michael Sinclair and Matthew Beadman is an excellent introduction to how Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can help you to pursue a life of meaning and purpose. The authors have brilliantly distilled the essence of ACT, drawing upon the most up-to-date science that underpins this new approach to cognitive behavioural therapy. This is a clear, engaging guide as to why we struggle with unwanted thoughts and feelings, and what steps you can take for an alternate, effective approach to life's experiences. The book uses carefully chosen exercises and metaphors, that will strengthen your ability to be aware of, and most importantly, do what most matters to you.

Today it&#x2019;s everything from a tool for fighting political oppression in the Middle East to a marketing must-have to the world&#x2019;s living room during live TV events to President Trump&#x2019;s preferred method of communication. It has hundreds of millions of active users all over the world. But few people know that it nearly fell to pieces early on. In this rousing history that reads like a novel, Hatching Twitter takes readers behind the scenes of Twitter&#x2019;s early exponential growth, following the four hackers&#x2014;Ev Williams, Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass, who created the cultural juggernaut practically by accident. It&#x2019;s a drama of betrayed friendships and high-stakes power struggles over money, influence, and control over a company that was growing faster than they could ever imagine. Drawing on hundreds of sources, documents, and internal e-mails, Bilton offers a rarely-seen glimpse of the inner workings of technology startups, venture capital, and Silicon Valley culture.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2013: </strong> Spoiler alert: The subtitle sorta says it all. That is, Nick Bilton's <em>Hatching Twitter</em> delivers "A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal," though not necessarily in that order. The book's four central players--Ev, Jack, Biz, and Noah--conceived of Twitter while working on Odeo, an ultimately doomed attempt to revolutionize podcasting. As their little chick grew, the four men's personal and ideological differences led to a power struggle that eventually left them all on the sidelines as a former stand-up comedian took Twitter into the uncertain future. Writing with the pacing and veracity of detail of a true-crime book, Bilton makes use of a trove of source material--from internal Twitter e-mails to extensive interviews with and early tweets by the founders themselves--and the result is as exciting and fast-paced as it is topically relevant. If you're looking for a thoughtful rumination about Twitter as a revolutionary global communications platform, keep looking. If you're looking for a quick, well-written, thoroughly researched human drama, the story of an utterly dysfunctional foursome and the accelerated unraveling of their once brilliant partnership, this is your book. #HighlyRecommended. --<em>Jason Kirk</em> (@brasswax)<b>Nick Bilton&nbsp;</b>is a columnist and reporter for&nbsp;The New York Times,&nbsp;where he explores the disruptive aspects of technology on business, culture and society.

However well intentioned they may be, leaders who deceive themselves always end up undermining their own performance.<p>This straightforward book explains how leaders can discover their own self-deceptions and learn how to escape destructive patterns. The authors demonstrate that breaking out of these patterns leads to improved teamwork, commitment, trust, communication, motivation, and leadership.</p></p><p>Using the story/parable format so popular these days, <i>Leadership and Self-Deception</i> takes a novel psychological approach to leadership. It's not what you do that matters, say the authors (presumably plural--the book is credited to the esteemed Arbinger Institute), but why you do it. Latching onto the latest leadership trend won't make people follow you if your motives are selfish--people can smell a rat, even one that says it's trying to empower them. The tricky thing is, we don't know that our motivation is flawed. We deceive ourselves in subtle ways into thinking that we're doing the right thing for the right reason. We really do know what the right thing to do is, but this constant self-justification becomes such an ingrained habit that it's hard to break free of it--it's as though we're trapped in a box, the authors say. <p> Learning how the process of self-deception works--and how to avoid it and stay in touch with our innate sense of what's right--is at the heart of the book. We follow Tom, an old-school, by-the-book kind of guy who is a newly hired executive at Zagrum Corporation, as two senior executives show him the many ways he's "in the box," how that limits him as a leader in ways he's not aware of, and of course how to get out. This is as much a book about personal transformation as it is about leadership per se. The authors use examples from the characters' private as well as professional lives to show how self-deception skews our view of ourselves and the world and ruins our interactions with people, despite what we sincerely believe are our best intentions. </p><p> While the writing won't make John Updike lose any sleep, the story entertainingly does the job of pulling the reader in and making a potentially abstruse argument quite enjoyable. The authors have a much better ear for dialogue than is typical of the genre (the book is largely dialogue), although a certain didactic tone creeps in now and then. But ultimately it's a hopeful, even inspiring read that flows along nicely and conveys a message that more than a few managers need to hear. --<i>Pat McGill</i></p>"Arbinger" is the ancient French spelling of the word "harbinger." It means "one that indicates or foreshadows what is to come; a forerunner." The Arbinger Institute is a forerunner, a "harbinger," of change. <p>Arbinger's change work grows out of the development at the heart of the human sciences that is introduced in this book. Led by philosopher Terry Warner, a team of scholars has broken new ground in solving the age-old problem of self-deception. The result is a striking account of human behavior and human potential. The Arbinger Institute was founded to translate this important work into practical effect for individuals, families, and organizations worldwide. </p><p>Arbinger's focus on organizations began when a well-known consultant asked for our help with one of his clients. As a result of Arbinger's work, that company became the industry's profit leader, eventually doubling and even tripling the return on investment of its nearest competitors. Out of that experience Arbinger began to focus on the organizational implications and applications of the self-deception problem and solution--a focus that continues today. </p><p>Founded by Terry Warner, Arbinger is led by managing directors Duane Boyce, Jim Ferrell, and Paul Smith.

It is a breathtaking achievement: panoramic yet humane, intensely political yet rich with local detail; and, above all, compulsively readable.</p><p>"Astonishing. . . . A rich and varied spectacle, full of wisdom and laughter and the touches of the unexpectedly familiar through which literature illuminates life." --<i>Wall Street Journal<br><br></i>"A serious and important work . . . the product of high intelligence and passionate conviction."<i> </i>--<i>New York Review of Books<br><br></i>"Monumental. . . . Few have caught the real sorrow and inexplicable strength of India, the unaccountable crookedness and sweetness, as well as Mistry." --Pico Iyer, <i>Time<br><br></i>"Those who continue to harp on the decline of the novel . . . ought to consider Rohinton Mistry. He needs no infusion of magic realism to vivify the real. The real world, through his eyes, is magical." --<i>The New York Times</i>With a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall the work of Charles Dickens, this magnificent novel captures all the cruelty and corruption, dignity and heroism, of India. The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. <br>As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, A Fine Balance creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.</p><h2>Sterling Point Books: John Paul Jones: The Pirate Patriot</h2><p>Presents the life and accomplishments of John Paul Jones, who commanded the American fleet during the Revolution and is recognized as the founder of the United States Navy.</p><p><p><b>Armstrong Sperry</b> was an award-winning author and illustrator of children's books.

Here is a book about nesting ospreys, multiple universes, atheism, spiritualism, and the arrow of time. Throughout, Lightman takes us back and forth between ordinary occurrences&#x2014;old shoes and entropy, sailing far out at sea and the infinite expanse of space.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In this slight volume, Lightman looks toward the universe and captures aspects of it in a series of beautifully written essays, each offering a glimpse at the whole from a different perspective: here time, there symmetry, not least God.

Not since Fred Hoyle in another era (and universe) has anyone dared to cover such a sweeping domain, and no one so elegantly, so parsimoniously, and so personally.

Any one of these essays invites deep reflection.

She was the founding president of the Central Park Conservancy.<p>Perhaps best known as the founding director of New York's Central Park Conservancy, which oversaw and funded the park's revitalization, Rogers (The Forests and Wetlands of New York City) here presents a comprehensive survey of landscape design. Viewing her subject as the art that modifies and shapes nature, she explores the cultural values that shape, or are embodied in, cities, parks, and gardens. Embracing all cultures and ranging from prehistoric times to the present, this book covers the broadest range of subjects implied by the title, including city planning, landscape architecture, conservation, earthworks, and other uses of land in contemporary art. While this history is international in scope, it does narrow its primary focus to the United States when it reaches the late 20th century. The photographs and especially the plans are excellent and numerous. Single pages or double-page spreads devoted to specific topics add an encyclopedic element while allowing Rogers to provide even more information, illustrations, and plans without interrupting the flow of her very readable text. Accessible to lay readers but of interest to scholars, this book could serve as the text for a comprehensive course on the history of landscape design. Highly recommended.

It is a game played by our mind against its own bad habits. Replacing one pattern of behaviour with a new, more positive one is the purpose of the &#34;Inner Game&#34;. Peak performance at tennis, like any sport, only comes when our mind is so focused that it is still and at one with what our body is doing. The key to the &#34;Inner Game&#34; and better tennis is achieving this state of relaxed concentration so that we are playing &#34;out of our mind&#34; and therefore no worrying about how, when or where to hit the ball. In The Inner Game of Tennis, Tim Gallwey, a professional player and instructor who has produced dramatic results among the amateurs and pros he has trained, explores how to overcome mental obstacles, improve concentration and reduce anxiety for better performance at every level. There is no physical reason why any of us should not more consistently serve aces or hit perfect returns. The Inner Games approach makes all the difference.</p><p>A phenomenon when first published in 1972, the <i>Inner Game</i> was a real revelation. Instead of serving up technique, it concentrated on the fact that, as Gallwey wrote, "Every game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game." The former is played against opponents, and is filled with lots of contradictory advice; the latter is played not against, but within the mind of the player, and its principal obstacles are self-doubt and anxiety. Gallwey's revolutionary thinking, built on a foundation of Zen thinking and humanistic psychology, was really a primer on how to get out of your own way to let your best game emerge. It was sports psychology before the two words were pressed against each other and codified into an accepted discipline.<p> The new edition of this remarkable work--Billie Jean King called the original her tennis bible--refines Gallwey's theories on concentration, gamesmanship, breaking bad habits, learning to trust yourself on the court, and awareness. "No matter what a person's complaint when he has a lesson with me, I have found the most beneficial first step," he stressed, "is to encourage him to <i>see</i> and <i>feel</i> what he is doing--that is, to increase his awareness of <i>what actually is</i>." </p><p> There are aspects of psychobabble and mysticism to be found here, sure, but Gallwey instructs as much by anecdote as anything else, and time has ultimately proved him a guru. What seemed radical in the early '70s is now accepted ammunition for the canon; the right mental approach is every bit as important as a good backhand. <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> still does much to keep that idea in play. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>The Inner Game of Tennis will help you: use the mind/body connection and learn to trust yourself on the court; find the state of &#34;relaxed concentration&#34; that allows you to play at your best; utilize the &#34;inner game principles to make the most of traditional instruction techniques; focus your mind to overcome nervousness and self-doubt; and build skills by smart practice, then put it all together in match play. Gallwey is one of the leading innovators in sports, and this new edition refines the techniques that he has perfected over his long career. His straightforward and concise style, clear examples, and illuminating anecdotes will help tennis players of all abilities - from beginner to expert. The Inner Game of Tennis will change the way you play the game.</p><h2>Black House</h2><p>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors of <i>The Talisman</i>, &#x201c;an intelligent...suspenseful page-turner&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>) from &#x201c;two master craftsmen, each at the top of his game&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>).<br><br>Twenty years ago, a boy named Jack Sawyer traveled to a parallel universe called the Territories to save his mother and her Territories &#x201c;Twinner&#x201d; from an agonizing death that would have brought cataclysm to the other world. Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly nonexistent hamlet of Tamarack, Wisconsin. He has no recollection of his adventures in the Territories, and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories.<br><br>When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades ago by a madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed &#x201c;the Fishman,&#x201d; and Jack&#x2019;s buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help the inexperienced force find him. But are these new killings merely the work of a disturbed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack&#x2019;s inexplicable waking dreams&#x2014;if that is what they are&#x2014;of robins&#x2019; eggs and red feathers? It&#x2019;s almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As this cryptic message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted tract of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.</p><p>In the seemingly paradisal Wisconsin town of French Landing, small distortions disturb the beauty: a talking crow, an old man obeying strange internal marching orders, a house that is both there and not quite there. And roaming the town is a terrible fiend nicknamed the Fisherman, who is abducting and murdering small children and eating their flesh. The sheriff desperately wants the help of a retired Los Angeles cop, who once collared another serial killer in a neighboring town.<p> Of course, this is no ordinary policeman, but Jack Sawyer, hero of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy <i>The Talisman</i>. At the end of that book, the 13-year-old Jack had completed a grueling journey through an alternate realm called the Territories, found a mysterious talisman, killed a terrible enemy, and saved the life of his mother and her counterpart in the Territories. Now in his 30s, Jack remembers nothing of the Talisman, but he also hasn't entirely forgotten: </p><blockquote>When these faces rise or those voices mutter, he has until now told himself the old lie, that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mother's neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story, a grand fantasy with good old Mom-saving Jack Sawyer at its center. None of it was real, and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen. By then he was calm. Just as he's calm now, running across his north field like a lunatic, leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him, but doing it <i>calmly</i>.</blockquote> Jack is abruptly pulled into the case--and back into the Territories--by the Fisherman himself, who sends Jack a child's shoe, foot still attached. As Jack flips back and forth between French Landing and the Territories, aided by his 20-years-forgotten friend Speedy Parker and a host of other oddballs (including a blind disk jockey, the beautiful mother of one of the missing children, and a motorcycle gang calling itself the "Hegelian Scum"), he tracks both the Fisherman and a much bigger fish: the <i>abbalah</i>, the Crimson King who seeks to destroy the axle of worlds. <p> While <i>The Talisman</i> was a straightforward myth in 1980s packaging, <i>Black House</i> is richer and more complex, a fantasy wrapped in a horror story inside a mystery, sporting a clever tangle of references to Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, jazz, baseball, and King's own Dark Tower saga. <i>Talisman</i> fans will find the sure-footed Jack has worn well--as has the King/Straub writing style, which is much improved with the passage of two decades. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

(The school later became the Providence Bible Institute when it was relocated to Providence, Rhode Island.) Kenyon served as an evangelist for over twenty years. In 1931, he became a pioneer in Christian radio on the Pacific Coast with his show Kenyon's Church of the Air, where he earned the moniker "The Faith Builder." He also began the New Covenant Baptist Church in Seattle. In addition to his pastoral and radio ministries, Kenyon wrote extensively.<br></p><h2>Favorite Medieval Tales</h2><p>In nine favorite tales from medieval Europe, such characters as King Arthur, Beowulf, and the merry outlaw Robin Hood weave an imagination-sparking tapestry of an enchanted time.</p><p>With this gorgeously produced volume Osborne and Howell meet and in some ways even exceed the standards they established in Favorite Norse Myths and Mermaid Tales from Around the World. The nine entries range from adaptations of widely known stories ("The Sword in the Stone"; "Robin Hood and His Merry Men") to more eclectic choices (Marie de France's "The Werewolf"; "The Chanticleer and the Fox," adapted from The Canterbury Tales); they also span about a thousand years of Western European literary history. Throughout, Osborne blends suspenseful storytelling with almost imperceptible explanations of the original context. For example, the Green Knight holds out his own head to Gawain, the knight who severed it, and reminds Gawain that he has promised, on his honor, to receive a blow of the ax in return. Osborne subtly relays the historical weight of this exchange: "Even the bravest warrior shuddered. Preserving a knight's honor was more important than preserving his own life." Howell, meanwhile, imaginatively bends medieval traditions to his own uses. As he explains in a detailed endnote, he models his paintings on such works as the Unicorn Tapestries and specific illuminated manuscripts. Adding to the book's educational value, Osborne prefaces each entry with an excerpt in the original language (along with a translation) and conveys further information in unusually meaty appendices. This stylish collection will not only entertain readers but will also nurture a lively interest in history, literature and language, and the way these forces of culture intersect. Ages 8-12. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-6, younger for reading aloud. Dramatic and immediate for storytelling, this companion volume to Osborne and illustrator Troy Howell's <i>Favorite Norse Myths</i> (1996) has the same large-size, handsome design with spacious type, thick paper, and full-page painting and illustrated title page for each story. Osborne's nine retellings are faithful in spirit to the original stories, from the Arthurian chivalry of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> to the cozy domesticity of Chaucer's beast fable "Chanticleer and the Fox." There is also a Robin Hood story, a French werewolf parable, and versions of <i>Finn Maccoul</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, the French <i>Song of Roland</i>, and the German <i>Island of the Lost Children</i>, all of them passed down orally and first written down between 1100 and 1450. Howell's acrylic paintings evoke the brightly detailed designs of illuminated manuscripts and medieval tapestries, with monsters and heroes, arches and battlefields. The excellent, readable notes provide historical and literary context, and many readers will go from here to the great full-blown retellings by such writers as Rosemary Sutcliff and Howard Pyle. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Strange Library</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

A little boy enters a quiet library -- &#x201c;even more hushed than usual,&#x201d; we&#x2019;re told in the opening line -- and is sent to Room 107, where he meets a creepy old librarian who leads him deep into a maze of dark catacombs beneath the library. There, we learn of the librarian&#x2019;s ghoulish designs and the boy encounters a small man wearing the skin of a sheep and a pretty young girl pushing a teacart, their worlds now &#x201c;all jumbled together.&#x201d; Not even fresh-made doughnuts can sweeten the boy&#x2019;s nightmarish predicament as the librarian&#x2019;s prisoner. <i>The Strange Library</i> was designed and illustrated by famed book jacket designer (and frequent Murakami collaborator) Chip Kidd, whose moody and mysterious depictions of a child&#x2019;s (and a parent&#x2019;s) darkest dream match Murakami&#x2019;s surreal imagination. It&#x2019;s hard to discern the message. Maybe something about knowledge being free or the value of libraries. No matter. This is vintage Murakami and, at the same time, something entirely fresh.

In their eagerness to erase all traces of the Third Reich from the earth, the Allies believed that Prussia, the very embodiment of German militarism, had to be abolished. </p><p> But as Christopher Clark reveals in this pioneering history, Prussia's legacy is far more complex. Though now a fading memory in Europe's heartland, the true story of Prussia offers a remarkable glimpse into the dynamic rise of modern Europe. </p><p> What we find is a kingdom that existed nearly half a millennium ago as a patchwork of territorial fragments, with neither significant resources nor a coherent culture. With its capital in Berlin, Prussia grew from being a small, poor, disregarded medieval state into one of the most vigorous and powerful nations in Europe. <i>Iron Kingdom</i> traces Prussia's involvement in the continent's foundational religious and political conflagrations: from the devastations of the Thirty Years War through centuries of political machinations to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, from the enlightenment of Frederick the Great to the destructive conquests of Napoleon, and from the "iron and blood" policies of Bismarck to the creation of the German Empire in 1871, and all that implied for the tumultuous twentieth century. </p><p> By 1947, Prussia was deemed an intolerable threat to the safety of Europe; what is often forgotten, Clark argues, is that it had also been an exemplar of the European humanistic tradition, boasting a formidable government administration, an incorruptible civil service, and religious tolerance. Clark demonstrates how a state deemed the bane of twentieth-century Europe has played an incalculable role in Western civilization's fortunes. <i>Iron Kingdom</i> is a definitive, gripping account of Prussia's fascinating, influential, and critical role in modern times. </p></p><p><b>Christopher Clark</b> is Senior Lecturer in Modern European History at St. Catharine&#x2019;s College, University of Cambridge. He is the author of <i>Politics of Conversion: Missionary Protestantism and the Jews in Prussia 1728&#x2013;1941</i> and <i>Kaiser Wilhelm II</i>, and the coeditor of <i>Culture Wars: Catholic-Secular Conflict in Nineteenth-Century Europe</i>.The story of Prussia is one that has been told many times, but seldom as intelligently, elegantly and interestingly as it is here. Christopher Clark has written a monumental history of a state that started from small beginnings as the Mark of Brandenburg, grew in size, violence and pretensions, and ended up being destroyed forever in 1947, when the victorious Allies decided they had had enough of this troublesome phenomenon...The bulk of a fascinating text, littered with intriguing detail and wry observation, focuses on this transformation in the 200 years from the bloody Thirty Years War in the 17th century (which cost Prussia half its population) to the creation by the Prussian nobleman Otto von Bismarck of a German Empire in 1871...Clark has written a masterly synthesis of [the] many disparate strands in a long and ultimately forlorn history. (Richard Overy <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2006-08-12)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i>, is a triumph of scholarship and imagination. This is a big book in every sense--at almost 800 pages, it's not one to slip in your briefcase for the train--but it zips along in a manner that belies its weight. In part this is because Clark writes so elegantly. This is history in its "grand sweep," but his vivid sketches of characters, places and events lighten the narrative. Yet for all its entertainment value, <i>Iron Kingdom</i> is at heart an unflinching engagement with one of Europe's most complex and far-reaching political and cultural entities, spanning four centuries of history and, he suggests at the end, even beyond. (Richard Aldous <i>Irish Times</i> 2006-08-26)<br><br>Clark's book, a survey of Prussian history from 1600 to 1947, is well-written, even sometimes sprightly, although it is hard to make easy reading of matters such as Pietism or the administrative reforms of the Baron Stein. <i>Iron Kingdom</i>'s triumph lies in a narrative structure that is even more impressive than the mass of detail that forms it; and one feels secure in the hands not only of a scholar but of a humane and fair interpreter of history. (Max Egremont <i>The Spectator</i> 2006-09-02)<br><br>To account for the rise and tumultuous extinction of Prussia is to explain how contemporary Europe came to assume its current form. It is a vast, Zeppelin-sized historical challenge; but it is also one to which Christopher Clark rises triumphantly, piloting his enormous subject through the best part of four centuries, traversing en route most of the continent of Europe, and carrying the reader with him on a bracing and exhilarating ride...For sheer range and intellectual horsepower, this book ranks as the best history of Prussia currently available in any language. However, more than that (and here it beats its German rivals hands-down), it is written with a literary finesse and narrative elan that establish its author as one of the finest writers of history at work in Britain today. It is a virtuoso performance. (John Adamson <i>Sunday Times</i> 2006-09-03)<br><br>It is only by contrary example that this book may remind us how miserable some hastily written products of the recent "history boom" have been. Clark is not one to swagger over the dead, secure in the knowledge that they cannot answer back. Instead, this is a well-informed and fair-minded historical investigation, written by a man who is plainly fascinated by the changing circumstances under which lives are lived and decisions made. One of the pleasures of this book is to watch Clark weighing the undeniable otherness of the past and resisting any tendency to convert it into a costume drama. (Patrick Wright <i>The Guardian</i> 2006-09-09)<br><br>You couldn't have the triumph and the tragedy of Prussia better told. Christopher Clark has a voracious appetite for detail and a tart turn of phrase. His study of Prussia, from beginning to end, vividly paints one of the big pictures of European history. (Peter Preston <i>The Observer</i> 2006-08-13)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i> is not just good: it is everything a history book ought to be. The research is scholarly but never obtrusive, the prose sprightly but never flippant, the judgements bold but always sound...The nemesis of Prussia has cast such a long shadow that German historians have tiptoed around the subject. Thus it was left to an Englishman to write what is surely the best history of Prussia in any language. (Daniel Johnson <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> 2006-08-06)<br><br>Many states have been conquered, partitioned, occupied, "ended" and even destroyed. Prussia is unique in that it was formally abolished by decree of the British, American, French and Soviet victors in February 1947, after it ceased to exist in any meaningful sense...Christopher Clark begins <i>Iron Kingdom</i>, his history of "the rise and downfall of Prussia," with this famous decree, but his remarkable book is not another exorcism, nor an uncritical celebration. He provides a sophisticated yet accessible account of how a middling German dynasty manoeuvred its way into the European pentarchy of powers. (Brendan Simms <i>The Independent</i> 2006-08-18)<br><br>This book ranks as the best history of Prussia currently available in any language... It is a virtuoso performance. (John Adamson <i>Sunday Times</i> 2006-09-03)<br><br><i>Iron Kingdom</i>, Christopher Clark's stately, authoritative history of Prussia from its humble beginnings to its ignominious end, presents a much more complicated and compelling picture of the German state, which is too often reduced to a caricature of spiked helmets and polished boots. Prussia and its army were inseparable, but Prussia was also renowned for its efficient, incorruptible civil service; its innovative system of social services; its religious tolerance; and its unrivaled education system, a model for the rest of Germany and the world. This too was Prussia--a tormented kingdom that, like a tragic hero, was brought down by the very qualities that raised it up. Mr. Clark, a senior lecturer in modern European history at Cambridge University, does an exemplary job. A lively writer, he organizes masses of material in orderly fashion, clearly establishing his main themes and pausing at crucial junctures to recapitulate and reconsider. Prussia, a self-invented artifact right down to its name, demands the kind of careful demythologizing that it receives from Mr. Clark, who gently but insistently exposes the flaws in most of the received wisdom about his subject. A result is an illuminating, profoundly satisfying work of history, brightened by vivid character sketches of the principals in his drama.

Matthew Corbett, professional 'problem solver,' has accepted a lucrative, if unusual, commission: escorting a beautiful woman to a fancy dress ball.<br> What should be a pleasant assignment takes a darker turn when Matthew becomes involved in a murder investigation. A sixteen-year-old girl has been stabbed to death on the grounds of a local plantation. The suspected killer is a slave who has escaped, with two family members, into the dubious protection of a nearby swamp. Troubled by certain discrepancies and determined to see some sort of justice done, Matthew joins the hunt for the runaway slaves. He embarks on a treacherous journey up the Solstice River, also known as the River of Souls. He discovers that something born of the swamp has joined the hunt...and is stalking the hunters with more than murder in mind.<br> What follows is a shattering ordeal encompassing snakes, alligators, exiled savages, mythical beasts, and ordinary human treachery. The journey up the River of Souls will test Matthew's courage, commitment, and powers of endurance. It will also lead him to a confrontation with a figure from his recent past, which will alter Matthew's life, setting the stage for the next installment in this compulsively readable series.<br> Gripping, unsettling, and richly atmospheric, The River of Souls is a masterful historical adventure and a major addition to Robert McCammon's extraordinary body of work.featuring the continuing exploits of a young hero USA Today has called 'the Early American James Bond.'</p><p><p>EDOARDO BALLERINI Edoardo Ballerini is best known for his on-screen work in The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire and the indie hit Dinner Rush.

The fifth book in the series, set in 1703, finds the young investigator in Charles Town, Carolina, where a girl has been murdered. Local residents are quick to identify the prime suspect: an escaped slave, who has fled into the swamps. Corbett, however, has his doubts, and&#x2014;even though he&#x2019;s a member of the party hunting for the slave&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not sure the man is a killer. The Corbett novels are rich, atmospheric stories, the kind of historical mystery that makes the reader feel as though he really has stepped back in time. Matthew is a very well designed character, very much a man of his time but also ahead of his time, as though he has stepped out of a modern-day crime lab into the early eighteenth century. For the author&#x2019;s fans, a definite must-read. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Junior League Celebration Cookbook: A Treasury of the 400 Most Requested Recipes from Junior League Cookbooks</h2><p>Collecting the most popular Junior League recipes from around the country, this compendium of more than four hundred recipes is enhanced with original essays on regional cooking and food traditions. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>The Junior League fetes its 100th anniversary with a collection of recipes from its 295 local chapters around the country.

She recalls their childhood under a domineering father, remembering Hertervig's difficulties fitting in, and likewise Hertervig the man: poors, always hovering on the brink, fanatical about painting and his own perceived shortcomings as an artist and human being. In the same hypnotic prose for which Fosse is famous, Melancholy II serves as an investigation not only into the "collateral damage" wrought by art and artists, but into a master's tools and obsessions as well.</p></p><p><p>One of <i>PopMatters</i> Best Books of 2014: Fiction</p>Called the new Ibsen in the German press, and heralded throughout Western Europe, Jon Fosse is one of contemporary Norwegian literature s most important writers.

He is the master who climbs down from the pages of the <i>koan</i> books and answers your questions face to face. If not face to face, you can at least find the answers as recorded in <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i>, a transcription of juicy excerpts from his lectures. From diverse topics such as transience of the world, sudden enlightenment, and the nuts and bolts of meditation, Suzuki always returns to the idea of beginner's mind, a recognition that our original nature is our true nature. With beginner's mind, we dedicate ourselves to sincere practice, without the thought of gaining anything special. Day to day life becomes our Zen training, and we discover that "to study Buddhism is to study ourselves."

Benn&#x2019;s series star, Billy Boyle, special investigator attached to Eisenhower&#x2019;s staff, is charged with brokering the deal; he lands in Sicily, but before he can make contact with the capo, he is wounded, loses his memory, and soon finds himself in the middle of a Mob-led embezzlement scam. Previous episodes in the series (The First Wave, 2007) have used similar premises, but this time Benn combines the mystery element with a fair amount of frontline battle scenes. The combination makes for a fast-paced mix of action, adventure, and crime solving&#x2014;and has the added benefit of reducing the space available for Billy&#x2019;s romantic life (Benn&#x2019;s decided weak point). Historical detail about the&nbsp;Sicily campaign will grab WWII buffs. A solid series that keeps getting better. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Bellows Falls</h2><p>When asked to investigate a small-town police department in Bellows Falls, homicide detective Joe Gunther becomes determined to separate myth from reality as he delves deep into a world of deceit, domestic violence, corrupt cops, drugs, and murder</p><p>Anyone who thinks life in small-town America is either idyllic <i>or</i> safe hasn't read Archer Mayor's series of murder mysteries set in Brattleboro, Vermont. Drugs, sex, murder--all those big-city crimes have their counterparts in the Green Mountain State, and Mayor's fictional police officer, Lieutenant Joe Gunther, is no Andy Griffith of Mayberry. In <i>Bellows Falls</i>, hard-boiled Gunther finds himself up to his neck in spousal abuse, sexual debauchery, teen crime, police corruption, and cold-blooded murder as he investigates a seemingly simple case of sexual harassment. Forget the cheddar cheese and maple syrup--visitors to Archer Mayor's Vermont get a close-up view of rural New England's dark side.Archer Mayor is the author of the highly acclaimed Vermont-based series featuring detective Joe Gunther, which the <i> Chicago Tribune </i> describes as &#x201c;the best police procedurals being written in America.&#x201d; He is a past winner of the New England Independent Booksellers Association Award for Best Fiction&#x2015;the first time a writer of crime literature has been so honored. In 2011, Mayor&#x2019;s 22nd Joe Gunther novel, TAG MAN, earned a place on <i> The New York Times </i> bestseller list for hardback fiction. <br> Before turning his hand to fiction, Mayor wrote history books, the most notable of which, <i> Southern Timberman: The Legacy of William Buchanan, </i> concerned the lumber and oil business in Louisiana from the 1870s to the 1970s. This book was published in 1988 and very well received; it was republished as a trade paperback in 2009. <br> Archer Mayor is a death investigator for Vermont&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a detective for the Windham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, the publisher of his own backlist, a travel writer for AAA, and he travels the Northeast giving speeches and conducting workshops. He has 25 years of experience as a volunteer firefighter/EMT. Mayor was brought up in the US, Canada and France and had been employed as a scholarly editor, a researcher for TIME-LIFE Books, a political advance-man, a theater photographer, a newspaper writer/editor, a lab technician for <i> Paris-Match Magazine </i> in Paris, France, and a medical illustrator. In addition to writing novels and occasional articles, Mayor gives talks and workshops all around the country, including the Bread Loaf Young Writers conference in Middlebury, Vermont, and the Colby College seminar on forensic sciences in Waterville, Maine. <br> Mayor&#x2019;s critically-acclaimed series of police novels feature Lt. Joe Gunther of the Brattleboro, Vermont, police department. The books, which have been appearing about once a year since 1988, have been published in five languages (if you count British), and routinely gather high praise from such sources as <i>The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New Yorker,</i> and others, often appearing on their &#x201c;ten best&#x201d; yearly lists. <br> Whereas many writers base their books only on interviews and scholarly research, Mayor&#x2019;s novels are based on actual experience in the field. The result adds a depth, detail and veracity to his characters and their tribulations that has led <i>The New York Times</i> to call him &#x201c;the boss man on procedures&#x201d;.</p><h2>The Complete Asian Cookbook</h2><p>Detailed recipes for more than eight hundred authentic Asian dishes draw on the culinary traditions and delights of sixteen countries, from Pakistan to the Philippines and from Japan to Indonesia</p><p>Through newspapers, magazines, television, cooking schools, and over twenty-five books, Charmaine Solomon has passed on her passion and knowledge of Asian cuisine.

Now, his sharply observed and beautifully drawn cartoons are available in English for the first time.<br>In 'Sunny Spells', originally published in France in 1999, Sempe explores a wide range of topics, from troubled relationships and office politics to doping scandals in the literary world. His cast of characters includes pious churchgoers, amateur painters and lovelorn palaeontologists, as well as psychiatrists, actors and football fans. Many of Sempe's intricate and evocative illustrations are accompanied by laconic, perfectly judged captions, which were translated by Anthea Bell, who also helped to bring Asterix the Gaul to the English-speaking world.</p><p>Jean-Jacques Semp� (b. 1932) is one of the most successful cartoonists and illustrators in the world, and still regularly contributes to magazines such as THE NEW YORKER and PARIS MATCH. Born in Bordeaux, Semp� was expelled from school for bad behavior. He enjoyed a variety of jobs, from traveling toothpaste salesman to summer camp worker, before winning an art prize in 1952. Although Semp� was never formally trained as an artist, more than twenty volumes of his drawings have been published, in thirty countries. Semp� also enjoys iconic status with generations of children (and adults) around the world, thanks to his collaboration with writer Rene Goscinny on a classic series of books about a little schoolboy called Nicholas. Phaidon Press published NICHOLAS (Hardback, 2005) to great acclaim last year.

Crime was soaring. Unemployment and inflation were out of control. A costly war had just come to its demoralizing end, and an unpopular President was on his way out of office. Then, over a sixteen-hour period, nature stepped forward with its own display of mayhem: an unprecedented outbreak of 148 tornadoes, covering thirteen states in the heart of the country, from Michigan to Mississippi. Hundreds of people were killed, thousands of homes demolished, and a billion dollars in losses sustained. Sixty-four of the tornadoes would be classified as severely violent; six belonged to the most rare, most deadly category: F5, or "incredible tornadoes."<p>Like the best nonfiction, <em>F5</em> is a brilliantly crafted page-turner that reads with the immediacy of a novel, telling a harrowing story of natural disaster against the backdrop of the turbulent 1970s. Acclaimed journalist Mark Levine follows the heart-wrenching fate of a rich cast of intertwined characters -- ordinary Americans whose lives are transformed in a terrifying instant. A pair of teenage lovers are caught while driving on a dark country road; a Vietnam veteran is trapped at home with a newborn baby; a sheriff finds himself in the line of fire twice in rapid succession; a black preacher with a past of dire hardship struggles to protect his family.</p><p>Other figures enter the story from the broader cultural scene, including Hank Aaron, on his way to challenging baseball's home run record amid racist death threats; Patty Hearst, whose image as kidnapping victim is undergoing a radical shift; Richard Nixon and George Wallace, both intent on using the storms to their political advantage; and a memorably eccentric scientist, known as Mr. Tornado, who regards the "Superoutbreak" as the apotheosis of his scholarly life. Gripping and revelatory, <em>F5</em> braids the story of the shattering outbreak with images of social upheaval and individual heroism in a stunning, unforgettable read.</p></p><p><b>Mark Levine</b> is an award-winning magazine writer who has contributed to <i>The New Yorker, Outside</i>, and <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i> among others and whose work has been included in <i>The Best American Magazine Writing, The Best American Sports Writing</i>, and <i>The Best American Poetry</i>. He is a regular contributor to the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and he teaches poetry at the Iowa Writers Workshop. Author of three books of poetry, he lives in Brooklyn and Iowa."In a sweeping and thoroughly engaging narrative, Mark Levine reminds us that extreme weather has always been with us, and has always had an impact that reaches well beyond the lives it shatters directly. <i>F5</i> reads like a novel, but is a masterpiece of careful reporting." -- <i>Mark Bowden, author of <i>Black Hawk Down</i></i><br><br>"Mark Levine has written a compelling meditation on those moments in which the atmosphere clothes itself in uncanny potency and visits the abodes of men." -- <i>Marilynn Robinson, author of <i>Gilead: A Novel</i></i><br><br>"Mark Levine's <i>F5</i> reads like tornado: powerful, riveting, and violently beautiful. Once the storm starts there is no chance of putting the book down. This is not just the story of explosive weather, but of one of the most explosive times in our history." -- <i>Ann Patchett, author of <i>Bel Canto</i></i><br><br>"Mark Levine's remarkable book is powerful and deeply frightening-especially when you understand the true scientific story of global warming. Mark Levine seamlessly blends the vital scientific realities of a monstrous <i>F5</i> with the captivating stories of the ordinary people whose lives were torn apart that fateful day in 1974. After reading F5, you will never look at a tornado warning the same way again." -- <i>John J. Nance, Aviation Analyst for <i>ABC News</i> and New York Times bestselling author of <i>Pandora's Clock</i></i><br><br>"Reading as if ripped from today's headlines, <i>F5</i> is an absolutely enthralling examination of that most mysterious--and most American--of natural disasters: the tornado. With his unique blend of a reporter's eye and a poet's heart, Levine has used the backdrop of catastrophe to both render a fascinating social history of one small corner of America, and to show the profound resilience of ordinary people caught in the thrall of extraordinary events. On all levels, he succeeds with grace and beauty." -- <i>Scott Anderson, author of <i>The Man Who Tried to Save the World</i></i><br><br>Reviewed by Gary Krist<br><br>Earthquakes can happen anywhere. Floods and wildfires don't seem to play favorites among the countries they afflict. Even volcanoes, though mainly concentrated on the edges of continental plates, are scattered somewhat widely over the globe. But a full three-quarters of the world's recorded overland whirlwinds occur in a single country: the United States. For whatever reason, tornadoes -- as Mark Levine points out in his arresting new book -- are "the archetypal American natural disaster."<br><br>Books about tornadoes, of course, are also pretty common in this country. I can't pretend to have read more than a handful of them, but I'd be surprised if any were more excruciatingly vivid than Levine's F5. Other writers might do a better job of explaining the meteorological details of tornado formation or the mechanics of predicting and tracking the storms, but let's admit it: Those are the parts that many readers skim or skip. When it comes to conveying the crushing human toll of an American twister, Levine has few peers. <br><br> Certainly, the weather event he's chosen to write about -- the "superoutbreak" of April 3, 1974 -- offers a wealth of potent material. In the space of just 17 hours on that muggy spring day, 148 tornadoes raked across the midsection of the North American landmass, ravaging 13 states and the Canadian province of Ontario. An astonishing six of these were category F5 storms, known appropriately as "incredible tornadoes," the rarest and most extreme type. The storms killed 335 people and injured more than 6,000, while causing property losses of more than $600 million. <br><br>But statistics alone tell us little about a natural disaster; the real meaning of calamity is fully appreciated only when refracted through the prism of individual experience. Levine, an award-winning magazine writer and the author of three books of poetry, understands this, so he has chosen to center his narrative on the ordeal of a handful of individuals and families in a single rural county in northern Alabama. The two huge tornadoes that ripped through Limestone County (just west of Huntsville) devastated the lives of many residents. Levine focuses on just a few: a pastor and his family, a young mother with a newborn baby, a 30-year-old lineman for an electric company. These are solidly average Americans, but it's their very ordinariness that brings home to us the freakishness of the natural force they encountered -- a force that can barely be described, let alone believed. <br><br>Felica Golden, a 15-year-old high school freshman, was driving with her 18-year-old boyfriend, Donnie, when their car was overtaken by the storm:<br><br>"Felica tugs the door's handle. It doesn't want to yield. She presses against the door with a shoulder. Nothing. She is trapped. Then, as though detonated, the door bursts open and is ripped from its hinges. . . . [The car] seizes and bucks in place. Its body is being mashed like wet clay beneath a heavy footstep. Its hood flips up. Its innards are jarred free and tossed. The windshield shatters...Donnie disappears, pulled through the hole where the windshield was as though on a string, and spun into darkness." <br> <br> The specter of exploitation always threatens to overshadow accounts of this type. Authors of disaster books must work hard to avoid turning victims into objects of unseemly voyeurism, and the problem is especially delicate when survivors and relatives of those affected are still alive. But Levine, a compassionate and conscientious writer, proves himself worthy of the trust he evidently received from the people he interviewed. He treats their stories with unfailing dignity and respect, giving the book a strong emotional grounding even in its most sensationalistic moments. <br><br> <i>F5</i> does stumble in places. Levine's attempts to link the disruptive physical energies of the superoutbreak with the chaotic temper of America in 1974 (think Nixon, Patty Hearst, the streaker at the Oscars) never achieve coherence. And there are a few interludes of spurious Roland Barthes-style showboating ("In its lighthearted way, [streaking] too is a spectacle of reversal. It asks to be liberated from stale habits of being. It posits a triumphant, if brief, return to the rule of nature and of pure sensation.") that doubtless play better in the author's poetry seminars than they do here. But when Levine keeps his focus on the concrete, his touch is sure. <i>F5</i> is a remarkable document, a stark demonstration that the price of even the most public disaster is always paid in the coin of personal loss. <br><br> Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

He spent ten years as a freelance film editor, but is now a full-time writer who lives in Bath, England, with his wife, two daughters, and son.The Greater&nbsp;Good<br> There was a harsh gale blowing on the night Yarvi learned he was a king. Or half a king, at least.<br> A seeking wind, the Gettlanders called it, for it found out every chink and keyhole, moaning Mother Sea&#x2019;s dead chill into every dwelling, no matter how high the fires were banked or how close the folk were huddled.<br> It tore at the shutters in the narrow windows of Mother Gundring&#x2019;s chambers and rattled even the iron--bound door in its frame. It taunted the flames in the firepit and they spat and crackled in their anger, casting clawing shadows from the dried herbs hanging, throwing flickering light upon the root that Mother Gundring held up in her knobbled fingers.<br> &#x201c;And this?&#x201d;<br> It looked like nothing so much as a clod of dirt, but Yarvi had learned better. &#x201c;Black--tongue root.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And why might a minister reach for it, my prince?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;A minister hopes they won&#x2019;t have to. Boiled in water it can&#x2019;t be seen or tasted, but is a most deadly poison.&#x201d;<br> Mother Gundring tossed the root aside. &#x201c;Ministers must sometimes reach for dark things.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ministers must find the lesser evil,&#x201d; said Yarvi.<br> &#x201c;And weigh the greater good. Five right from five.&#x201d; Mother Gundring gave a single approving nod and Yarvi flushed with pride. The approval of Gettland&#x2019;s minister was not easily won. &#x201c;And the riddles on the test will be easier.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The test.&#x201d; Yarvi rubbed nervously at the crooked palm of his bad hand with the thumb of his good.<br> &#x201c;You will pass.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be sure.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is a minister&#x2019;s place always to doubt&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But always to seem certain,&#x201d; he finished for her.<br> &#x201c;See? I know you.&#x201d; That was true. No one knew him better, even in his own family. Especially in his own family. &#x201c;I have never had a sharper pupil. You will pass at the first asking.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll be Prince Yarvi no more.&#x201d; All he felt at that thought was relief. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have no family and no birthright.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You will be Brother Yarvi, and your family will be the Ministry.&#x201d; The firelight found the creases about Mother Gundring&#x2019;s eyes as she smiled. &#x201c;Your birthright will be the plants and the books and the soft word spoken. You will remember and advise, heal and speak truth, know the secret ways and smooth the path for Father Peace in every tongue. As I have tried to do. There is no nobler work, whatever nonsense the muscle--smothered fools spout in the training square.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The muscle--smothered fools are harder to ignore when you&#x2019;re in the square with them.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; She curled her tongue and spat into the fire. &#x201c;Once you pass the test you only need go there to tend a broken head when the play gets too rough. One day you will carry my staff.&#x201d; She nodded toward the tapering length of studded and slotted elf--metal which leaned against the wall. &#x201c;One day you will sit beside the Black Chair, and be Father Yarvi.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Father Yarvi.&#x201d; He squirmed on his stool at that thought. &#x201c;I lack the wisdom.&#x201d; He meant he lacked the courage, but lacked the courage to admit it.<br> &#x201c;Wisdom can be learned, my prince.&#x201d;<br> He held his left hand, such as it was, up to the light. &#x201c;And hands? Can you teach those?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You may lack a hand, but the gods have given you rarer gifts.&#x201d;<br> He snorted. &#x201c;My fine singing voice, you mean?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why not? And a quick mind, and empathy, and strength. Only the kind of strength that makes a great minister, rather than a great king. You have been touched by Father Peace, Yarvi. Always remember: strong men are many, wise men are few.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No doubt why women make better ministers.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And better tea, in general.&#x201d; Gundring slurped from the cup he brought her every evening, and nodded approval again. &#x201c;But the making of tea is another of your mighty talents.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hero&#x2019;s work indeed. Will you give me less flattery when I&#x2019;ve turned from prince into minister?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You will get such flattery as you deserve, and my foot in your arse the rest of the time.&#x201d;<br> Yarvi sighed. &#x201c;Some things never change.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Now to history.&#x201d; Mother Gundring slid one of the books from its shelf, stones set into the gilded spine winking red and green.<br> &#x201c;Now? I have to be up with Mother Sun to feed your doves. I was hoping to get some sleep before&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you sleep when you&#x2019;ve passed the test.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She licked one finger, ancient paper crackling as she turned the pages. &#x201c;Tell me, my prince, into how many splinters did the elves break God?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Four hundred and nine. The four hundred Small Gods, the six Tall Gods, the first man and woman, and Death, who guards the Last Door. But isn&#x2019;t this more the business of a prayer--weaver than a minister?&#x201d;<br> Mother Gundring clicked her tongue. &#x201c;All knowledge is the business of the minister, for only what is known can be controlled. Name the six Tall Gods.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Mother Sea and Father Earth, Mother Sun and Father Moon, Mother War and&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> The door banged wide and that seeking wind tore through the chamber. The flames in the firepit jumped as Yarvi did, dancing distorted in the hundred hundred jars and bottles on the shelves. A figure blundered up the steps, setting the bunches of plants swinging like hanged men behind him.<br> It was Yarvi&#x2019;s Uncle Odem, hair plastered to his pale face with the rain and his chest heaving. He stared at Yarvi, eyes wide, and opened his mouth but made no sound. One needed no gift of empathy to see he was weighed down by heavy news.<br> &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; croaked Yarvi, his throat tight with fear.<br> His uncle dropped to his knees, hands on the greasy straw. He bowed his head, and spoke two words, low and raw.<br> &#x201c;My king.&#x201d;<br> And Yarvi knew his father and brother were dead.</p><h2>The Mechanical Design Process</h2><p><p>The Mechanical Design Process combines a practical overview of the design process with case material and real-life engineering insights.

It performed a cursory optical scan and noted the scrapes on her lips and forehead; the sling supporting her right arm. She had begun to regain muscle mass, though she remained&#x2014;the droid permitted itself a poetic flourish&#x2014;frail.<br><br>&#x201c;You remember the precise altitude?&#x201d; the droid asked. For this interaction it had chosen a masculine voice, bass and hollow. The sound projected from a speaker on the underside of its spherical black chassis.<br><br>&#x201c;I have an extremely good memory.&#x201d;<br><br>The droid oriented the red lens of its photoreceptor as if to stare. &#x201c;So do I.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman met its gaze. The droid readjusted the lens.<br><br>This is the story she told.<br><br>Eighteen kilometers above the surface of the planet Nacronis, Yrica Quell fled for her life.<br><br>The siltstorm raged outside her starfighter, blue and yellow mud roiling against the faceted viewport. A burst of wind lifted the ship&#x2019;s port-side wing, nearly sending her into a spin; she adjusted her repulsors with her gloved left hand while the right urged a rattling lever into position. The ship leveled out, and the comforting howl of its twin ion engines rose to a screech as six million stony granules entered the exhaust. Quell winced as she bounced in her harness, listening to her vessel&#x2019;s agony.<br><br>Emerald light shot past the viewport, incinerating ribbons of airborne mud. She increased her thrust and plunged deeper into the storm, ignoring the engines&#x2019; scream.<br><br>Her scanner showed three marks rapidly closing from behind&#x2014;two fewer than she&#x2019;d hoped for. She moved a hand to the comm, recalibrated her frequency, and called out two names: &#x201c;Tonas? Barath?&#x201d; When no one answered, she recalibrated again and tried, &#x201c;This is TIE pilot Yrica Quell to Nacronis ground control.&#x201d; But Tonas and Barath were surely dead, and the locals were jammed, out of range, or ardently inclined to ignore her.<br><br>Another volley of emerald particle bolts sizzled past her ship. Quell maintained her vector. She was a fine defensive pilot, but only the storm could keep her alive now. She had to trust to the wind and the blinding mud to throw off her enemy&#x2019;s aim.<br><br>Her comm sounded at last. &#x201c;Lieutenant Quell?&#x201d;<br><br>She leaned forward, straining at her harness, trying to peer through the storm as her teeth chattered and her hips knocked against her seat. A ribbon of blue silt streaked by and she glimpsed, beyond it, a flash of white light: lightning ahead and twenty degrees to port.<br><br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Quell? Please acknowledge.&#x201d;<br><br>She considered her options. She could head toward the lightning&#x2014;toward the storm&#x2019;s center, where the winds would be strongest. There she could try to locate an updraft. Reduce her thrust, overcharge her repulsors, and let the draft and the repulsors&#x2019; antigravity toss her ship high while her pursuers passed below. If she didn&#x2019;t black out, if she didn&#x2019;t become disoriented, she could dip back down and re-engage her enemy from behind, eliminating one, maybe two before they realized where she&#x2019;d gone.<br><br>&#x201c;You are hereby ordered to reduce speed, eject, and await pickup, detention, and court-martial.&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t imagine that the man on the other end of the comm would fall for such a maneuver. More likely she&#x2019;d be shot down while she spun helplessly through the sky.<br><br>Of course, she&#x2019;d also be shot if she ejected. Major Soran Keize was a good man, an admirable man, but she knew there would be no court-martial.<br><br>She changed course toward the lightning and pitched her ship incrementally downward. Toward the ground, she reminded herself&#x2014;ground, like atmosphere and gravity, was a challenge she normally flew without. Another flash of emerald suggested her foes were getting closer, likely attempting to catch her in their crossfire.<br><br>She let the wind guide her. She couldn&#x2019;t outfly Major Keize, but she was at least as good as his squadron mates. She&#x2019;d flown with Shana, seen Tong&#x2019;s flight stats, and Quell deserved her fate if she couldn&#x2019;t match them both. She dived through a ribbon of yellow silt that left her momentarily blind, then reduced her repulsor output until the TIE fighter&#x2019;s aerodynamics took over and sent it veering at a sharp angle. Quell might find atmospheric flight challenging, but her opponents would find an enemy jerked about by gravity positively confounding. The next volley of particle blasts was just a glimmer in her peripheral vision.<br><br>They would be back on her soon. A thunderclap loud enough to resonate in her bones reassured her she was near the storm&#x2019;s center. She wondered, startled by the thought, if she should say something to the major before the end&#x2014;make some last plea or acknowledgment of their years together&#x2014;then blotted the idea from her mind. She&#x2019;d made her decision.<br><br>She looked through her streaked cockpit at the swirling vortex of colors. She accelerated as hard as the TIE would allow, checked her instruments through the pain in her skull and the glimmering spots in front of her eyes, counted to five, then tilted her fighter an additional fifty degrees toward the ground.<br><br>After that, two events occurred nearly simultaneously. Somehow she was aware of them both.<br><br>As Quell&#x2019;s fighter rushed toward the surface of Nacronis, her three pursuers&#x2014;already accelerating to match Quell&#x2019;s speed&#x2014;flew directly toward the storm center. Two of the enemy TIEs, according to her scanner, attempted to break away. They were caught by the gale and, as they decelerated, swept into each other. Both were immediately destroyed in the collision.<br><br>The third pilot attempted to navigate the gauntlet of lightning and silt. He fared better, but his starfighter wasn&#x2019;t equal to his skill. Something went wrong&#x2014;Quell guessed that silt particles had crept into seams in the TIE&#x2019;s armor, or that a lightning strike had shorted the fighter&#x2019;s systems&#x2014;and Major Soran Keize, too, disappeared from her scanner. The ace of the 204th Imperial Fighter Wing was dead.<br><br>At the same time her pursuers met their end, Quell attempted to break out of her dive. She saw nothing of the world outside her cockpit, nothing beyond her instruments, and her body felt leaden as she operated the TIE&#x2019;s controls. She&#x2019;d managed to level out the ship when she heard a deafening crash and felt her seat heave beneath her. She realized half a second later that the bottom of her starboard wing had struck the mire of Nacronis&#x2019;s surface and was dragging through the silt. Half a second after that, she lost total control of her vessel and made the mistake of reaching for the ejector switch with her right hand.<br><br>The TIE fighter halted abruptly and she was thrown at the now-cracked viewport. The safety harness caught her extended right arm and snapped her brittle bones as the straps cut into her body. Her face smashed against the inside of her flight helmet. Agony and nausea followed. She heard nothing but an unidentifiable dull roar. She blacked out and woke almost immediately&#x2014;swiftly enough to savor the still-fresh pain.<br><br>Quell had an extremely good memory, but she didn&#x2019;t remember cutting herself free of the safety harness or clambering out of the cockpit hatch. She didn&#x2019;t remember whether she&#x2019;d vomited when she&#x2019;d removed her helmet. She remembered, vaguely, the smell of burning circuits and her own sweat&#x2014;but that was all, until she sat on top of her broken craft amid a multicolored marsh and looked up at the sky.<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was night or day. The swirling, iridescent storm looked like an oily whirlpool, blotting out sun or stars or both. It churned and grew, visibly expanding moment by moment. Glimmering above the white lightning, faint and high, were the orange lights of atmospheric explosions: the payloads of other TIE fighters.<br><br>The explosions would stoke the storm, Quell knew&#x2014;stoke and feed it, and others like it, until storms tore through every city on Nacronis. The silt would flay towers and citadels to their steel bones. Children would choke on mud flooding the streets. All because an order had been given, and only Quell and Tonas and Barath had bothered to defy it.<br><br>This was what her Empire had become in the days after Endor. She saw it now, but she was too late to save Nacronis.</p><h2>The Great Omission: Reclaiming Jesus&#39;s Essential Teachings on Discipleship</h2><p><p>Jesus's Last Command&#x2014;Ignored!</p><p>The last command Jesus gave the church before he ascended to heaven was the Great Commission, the call for Christians to "make disciples of all the nations." But Christians have responded by making "Christians," not "disciples." This, according to brilliant scholar and renowned Christian thinker Dallas Willard, has been the church's Great Omission.</p></p><p>In his earlier books Dallas Willard has laid out the principal ideas for a revolutionary understanding of what the Christian life is really about. This volume collects articles, talks, and interviews where Willard explains the practical application of his ideas. He answers such questions as what does it mean to be Jesus&#x2019; disciple? How does God teach us? How do we know what God wants for us? How do we explain Jesus to others? And much more.<p>Dallas Willard was a professor at the University of Southern California's School of Philosophy until his death in 2013. His groundbreaking books <em>The Divine Conspiracy</em>, <em>The Great Omission</em>, <em>Knowing Christ Today</em>, <em>Hearing God</em>, <em>The Spirit of the Disciplines</em>, <em>Renovation of the Heart</em>, and <em>The Divine Conspiracy Continued</em> forever changed the way thousands of Christians experience their faith.</p></p><h2>How to Train Your Dragon: How to Speak Dragonese (How to Train Your Dragon, 3)</h2><p><b>Don't miss a moment of the How to Train Your Dragon series, the bestselling, funny, action-packed books that inspired the hit movies! <br><br></b>The story begins when Hiccup, his friend Fishlegs, and his cranky dragon Toothless get separated from their class during Boarding-an-Enemy-Ship practice.

She is also the author of <em>The Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown</em>, <em>What Shall We Do With the Boo Hoo Baby?</em> and numerous other picture books.Grade 3-5&#x2013;The misfit hero of <i>How to Be a Pirate</i> (Little, Brown, 2005) returns in another Viking tall tale. Chief's son Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, his friend Fishlegs, and his cranky dragon, Toothless, get separated from their class during Boarding-An-Enemy-Ship practice. The peaceful fishing boat they are supposed to attack turns out to be a prowling Roman galley, crewed by some of the Empire's least-distinguished legions. The invaders are plotting to provoke war among the Viking factions by kidnapping the heirs of Hiccup's own Happy Hooligans and the Amazonian Bog-Burglar tribe. Then, while the locals are occupied, the Romans plan to make off with the entire dragon population of the islands. With the help of Bog-Burglar girl warrior Camicazi and the bumblebee-sized dragon Ziggerastica, the boys must find a way to counter the treacherous plan before they all end up facing combat to the death in the local arena. There is a lot of raucous humor and mock-heroic dialogue; ridiculous names add to the fun. The theme of brains over brawn is well defined. Warriors, Roman and Viking alike, are loud-mouthed, bullying braggarts, easy targets for clever, scrawny Hiccup. The sketchy, childlike black-and-white cartoon drawings are amusing but occasionally indistinct. Jon Scieszka's Time Warp Trio books (Viking), for slightly younger readers, have a sharper, more literate sense of twisted history, but the broad humor of Hiccup's misadventures will appeal to reluctant readers.<i>&#x2013;Elaine E.

Czerski provides the tools to alter the way we see everything around us by linking ordinary objects and occurrences, like popcorn popping, coffee stains, and fridge magnets, to big ideas like climate change, the energy crisis, or innovative medical testing. She provides answers to vexing questions: How do ducks keep their feet warm when walking on ice? Why does it take so long for ketchup to come out of a bottle? Why does milk, when added to tea, look like billowing storm clouds? In an engaging voice at once warm and witty, Czerski shares her stunning breadth of knowledge to lift the veil of familiarity from the ordinary.</p></p><p>Helen Czerski is a physicist at University College London&#x2019;s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and a science presenter for BBC. She writes a monthly column for&nbsp;BBC Focus magazine&nbsp;called &#x201c;Everyday Science&#x201d; that was shortlisted for a Professional Publishers Association award.&#x201c;Helen Czerski&#x2019;s engaging debut book seeks to demystify physics in everyday life, so whether you know your refraction from your reflection, or find the entire subject incomprehensible, this should be an invaluable primer.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Excellent... an ideal gift for any scientifically inquisitive person, including children or adults who retain a child's sense of wonder.

He delves into the places that we fear to go with our issues about prayer, encouraging us with gentle kindness and words of hope and inspiration. The book is divided into five sections. Why Pray? Illustrates the purposes and benefits of prayer for ourselves, as well as for the broader Catholic community and even the world. Why Is It so Hard? Notes how our contemporary culture conspires against taking time out for solitude and prayer, and how our own ego&#x2014;with its fears, restlessness, and narcissism&#x2014;can work against developing a deeper relationship with God through prayer. What Is Prayer? Outlines the two basic types of prayer, that is, affective (personal) and priestly (for the world). Describes the many ways or methods for each type of prayer, such as meditation, contemplation, the divine office, the Mass, and Scripture. Sticking with It. This section covers the development of mature prayer, discussing ways to pray in times of boredom, disillusionment, crisis, helplessness, or after a loved one&#x2019;s death. Mysticism. Here we learn about this increasingly popular form of intimate relationship with God. This is a book for all manner of believers, whether your faith is solidly rooted, wavering between childhood religion and adult faith, or just not sure what you believe&#x2014;or whether you believe at all. It addresses topics such as narcissism, pragmatism, efficiency, and self-gratification that work against a healthy spiritual life. Rolheiser takes us to a place of contact and comfort, in relationship not only with God but with our true selves as well.</p><p>Ronald Rolheiser, a Roman Catholic priest with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, is an internationally renowned speaker and spiritual writer. His award-winning weekly column &#34;In Exile&#34; is carried by more than seventy newspapers worldwide. He is president of the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas. Rolheiser is among the most popular and inclusive spiritual writers today. Although rooted in the Catholic faith, he is able to transcend denominational boundaries and religious language to appeal to both practicing Christians and unaffiliated seekers."Many modern men and women claim to be so busy that they don't have time for a prayer life; they often feel uneasy with inner exploration in a culture where people spend their days skimming the surface of things instead of diving deep. Rolheiser rejoices in the idea of prayer as lifting the heart and mind to God. Part of this practice is celebrating God's presence and grace in our lives. The author salutes the importance of affective prayer&#x2014;meditation, centering prayer, praying the rosary, and devotional prayers of all kinds. Rolheiser suggests that maturity in prayer is signified by patience with God, the sustaining power of ritual, facing our demons, wrestling with God, overcoming anger and despair, and sensing God as our real mother."&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Frederic and Mary Brussat</b>, <i>Spirituality and Practice</i><br><br>"Rolheiser avoids the superficial how-to methods and focuses instead on clarifying the deep longing in the human heart for communion and intimacy with God. Using a compassionate and encouraging style, Rolheiser redirects believers&#x2019; common misconceptions and misunderstandings about prayer to the freedom, fulfillment, and necessity of spending time with the Heavenly Father.&nbsp;Although <i>Prayer</i> is a slim book, the guidance Rolheiser provides is meaty and scriptural. He keeps his stories and explanations on a common reader&#x2019;s level and does not try to impress with lofty, pious terminology or concepts. <i>Prayer</i> will help readers gain a clearer picture of the importance of prayer and encourage them not to be content with just a surface relationship with God.&nbsp;&#x2014; <b>Jeff Friend</b>, <i>Foreword Reviews</i></p><h2>Groove Essentials 1.0 - The Play-Along: The Groove Encyclopedia for the 21st Century Drummer</h2><p>(Percussion).

Beginning with simple tests and explanations of general care issues like dehydration examinations and triage, this guide then moves on to an alphabetical listing of every possible situation, from arrow wounds to worms. <p> The individual sections are good for both general reading and instant assistance. Each one starts with a notice of when to call the vet--immediately, the same day, or as needed.

The information that follows this simple checklist is divided into "do this now," "special situations," "follow-up care," and "the best approach." Whenever necessary, simple sketches are included to help show proper technique, such as fashioning an instant muzzle from a pair of nylons, or how to cover a dog's head in case of an ear-flap injury. Relying frequently on common household items like antihistamines, turkey basters, Gatorade, and plastic wrap, this guide assumes most of us won't have special medical training or supplies and focuses on very specific and simple methods of helping your pet achieve the best possible care.

He has worked as a crime reporter for&nbsp;<i>Expressen,&nbsp;</i>and has written several novels, including&nbsp;<i>Fall of Man in Wilmslow</i>. He worked with international soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovi&#x107; on his memoir,&nbsp;<i>I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovi&#x107;,&nbsp;</i>which was short-listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award and was nominated for the August Prize in Sweden.Wrange tried to concentrate on the game, but he was not managing too well. Fortunately this punk girl was going to be easy pickings. She wasn&#x2019;t bad, as it turned out&#x2014;she probably spent a lot of time playing&#x2014;but what good was that? He toyed with her a little, and she was bound to be impressed. Who knows, maybe he could even get her to come home with him after- wards. True, she looked stroppy, and Wrange did not go in for stroppy girls, but she had nice tits and he might be able to take out his frustrations on her. It had been a disaster of a morning. <br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t grief that he felt: it was fear. Wrange really did try hard to convince himself that he had done the right thing. What did the goddamn professor expect when he treated him as if he didn&#x2019;t exist? But of course it wouldn&#x2019;t look good that Wrange had sold him down the river. He consoled himself with the thought that an idiot like Balder must have made thou- sands of enemies, but deep down he knew: the one event was linked to the other, and that scared him to death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since Balder had started working at Solifon, Wrange had been afraid that the drama would take a frightening new turn, and here he was now, wishing that it would all go away. That must have been why he went into town this morning on a compulsive spree to buy a load of designer clothes, and had ended up here at the chess club. Chess still managed to distract him, and the fact was that he was feeling better already. He felt like he was in control and smart enough to keep on fooling them all. Look at how he was playing.<br> &nbsp;<br> This girl was not half bad. In fact there was something unorthodox and creative in her play, and she would probably be able to teach most people in here a thing or two. It was just that he, Arvid Wrange, was crushing her. His play was so brilliant and sophisticated that she had not even noticed he was on the brink of trapping her queen. Stealthily he moved his positions forward and&nbsp; snapped it up&nbsp; without sacrificing more than a knight. In a flirty, casual tone bound to impress her he said, &#x201c;Sorry, baby. Your queen is down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But he got nothing in return, no smile, not a word, nothing. The girl upped the tempo, as if she wanted to put a quick end to her humiliation, and why not? He&#x2019;d be happy to keep the process short and take her out for two or three drinks before he pulled her. Maybe he would not be very nice to her in bed. The chances were that she would still thank him afterwards. A miserable cunt like her would be unlikely to have had a fuck for a long time and would be totally unused to guys like him, cool guys who played at this level. He decided to show off a bit and explain some higher chess theory. But he never got the chance. Something on the board did not feel quite right. His game began to run into some sort of resistance he could not understand. For a while he persuaded himself that it was only his imagination, perhaps the result of a few careless moves. If only he concentrated he would be able to put things right, and so he mobilized his killer instinct.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the situation just got worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt trapped&#x2014;however hard he tried to regain the initiative she hit back&#x2014;and in the end he had no choice but to acknowledge that the balance of power had shifted, and shifted irreversibly. How crazy was that? He had taken her queen, but instead of building on that advantage he had landed in a fatally weak position. Surely she had not deliberately sacrificed her queen so early in the game? That would be impossible&#x2014;the sort of thing you read about in books, it doesn&#x2019;t happen in your local chess club in Vasastan, and it&#x2019;s definitely not something that pierced punk chicks with attitude problems do, especially not to great players like him. Yet there was no escape.<br> &nbsp;<br> In four or five moves he would be beaten and so he saw no alternative but to knock over his king with his index finger and mumble congratulations. Even though he would have liked to serve up some excuses, some- thing told him that that would make matters worse. He had a sneaking feeling that his defeat was not just down to bad luck, and almost against his will he began to feel frightened again. Who the hell was she?<br> Cautiously he looked her in the eye and now she no longer looked like a stroppy, insecure nobody. Now she seemed cold&#x2014;like a predator eyeing its prey. He felt deeply ill at ease, as if the defeat on the chessboard were but a prelude to something much, much worse. He glanced towards the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going anywhere,&#x201d; she said. <br> &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Nobody special.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So we haven&#x2019;t met before?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But nearly, is that it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve met in your nightmares, Arvid.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Is this some kind of joke?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What do you think I mean?<br> &#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He could not understand why he was so scared.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Matrix of Power:How the World Has Been Controlled By Powerful People Without Your Knowledge</h2><p>Jordan Maxwell is considered to be the world&#39;s foremost authority on ancient religions and modern conspiracies.

After serving in the First World War, he embarked upon a distinguished academic career and was recognized as one of the finest philologists in the world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. He is, however, beloved throughout the world as the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic works as <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. He died on September 2, 1973, at the age of 81.With the appearance of <i>The Silmarillion</i>, the publication of<br>J. R. R. Tolkien's mythopoesis is virtually complete. The<br>reader can now appreciate the full scope and significance of the<br>history of Aman and Middle-earth, the central stages in the great<br>drama of the Creation of Eae. One can trace in detail the Light of<br>Aman from the Two Trees on Ezellohar to the renewing power of<br>the Phial of Galadriel in the stinking darkness of Shelob's Lair.<br>The terror felt there by Sam Gamgee is better understood after<br>reading of the Unlight of Ungoliant, and Boromir's desire for the<br>Ring can be seen as a wisp of the Shadow of Melkor, who lusted<br>after Light but created only Darkness. Not only do the great conflicts<br>between East and West--from the First War and the Battle of<br>the Powers to the Battle of Fornost and the War of the Ring--<br>reveal the nature of good and evil and the immeasurable compassion<br>of Iluvatar, but also, the identity of the forces that intervene<br>to give victory to the good suggests the progressive freeing of Man<br>from the influence of both Valar and demons to work out his own<br>destiny, known to Iluvatar alone.<br><br>Writing this revised edition of my <i>Guide to Middle-earth</i> has<br>enhanced my awareness of these correspondences, designs which<br>are surely central to the joy of Faerie and which give Professor<br>Tolkien's work its marvelous and profound coherence. But it has<br>also made me aware of the difference between the conception and<br>the realization of this cycle of myth and romance, between the<br>'visionary scene' and its 'frame,' 1 between the Vision and the Text.<br>The 'seamless web of Story' 2 is indeed endless and without blemish,<br>but books--and lives--alas, are not. In the first edition of the<br><i>Guide</i>, I used any information available to me that I believed came<br>from Professor Tolkien and had been transmitted accurately; I<br>hoped that these details would ultimately appear in print. But<br>now--faced with a plethora of revised texts, calendars, letters, illustrations,<br>interviews, anecdotes, and reports of conversations,<br>some containing contradictory information--I have come to believe<br>that inconsistencies, sometimes deliberately maintained by<br>Professor Tolkien, occur where the details of the Vision were not<br>clear to him, where he was stymied by a single leaf on the Tree,<br>not sure of 'its shape, and its sheen, and the glistening of dewdrops<br>on its edge,' 3 not yet ready to fix it in the Text. Yet these inconsistencies,<br>which can bulk large in an alphabetic treatment of Faerie,<br>should not be allowed to detract from the general bloom of this<br>lushly foliated Tree.<br><br>So this revised <i>Guide</i> is limited to the Text, to published works<br>by Professor Tolkien in the latest editions available to American<br>readers. The basic text for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is again the Ballantine<br>paperback edition, with emendations from the revised<br>Houghton Mifflin hardback edition; Appendix C contains a concordance<br>between the two editions. British editions contain several<br>further emendations, which I have not taken into account; of<br>those I have heard of or seen, the most significant is the change of<br><i>d</i> to <i>dh</i> in <i>Galadrim</i> and <i>Caras Galadon</i>, which resolves the confusion<br>(encouraged, it seems, by the Elves themselves, as Christopher<br>Tolkien's comment in <i>The Silmarillion</i> on<i> Galadhriel</i> suggests)<br>between Sindarin <i>galad</i> 'light' and<i> galadh</i> 'tree.' The three exceptions<br>to this rule of Text are sources which seem particularly trustworthy:<br>the Pauline Baynes map of Middle-earth displays a number<br>of place-names evidently given her by Professor Tolkien; Clyde<br>Kilby's intimate <i>Tolkien</i> and the<i> Silmarillion</i> contains intriguing hints<br>of the End; so much of the information contained in Professor<br>Tolkien's letters to and conversations with my friend Dick Plotz<br>has been corroborated by <i>The Silmarillion</i> that I feel confident in<br>using other items.<br><br>In general, I hope that I have not forgotten the limits of a reference<br>work. I count myself fortunate to have wandered in the<br>Fairy-realm of Arda for fifteen years now, and while my tongue is<br>certainly not tied, for the sake of my own delight I have learned<br>not 'to ask too many questions, lest the gates should be shut and<br>the keys be lost.' 4 This <i>Guide</i> is intended to be supplementary to<br>the works of Professor Tolkien and no more; its value is that it can<br>clarify deep-hidden historical facts and draw together scraps of information<br>whose relation is easily overlooked, thus aiding the<br>wanderer in Arda in his quest for its particular Truth. When matters<br>are unclear in the Text I have tried to remain silent, but those<br>places where I have been unable to restrain my conjectures are liberally<br>sprinkled with 'perhaps', 'presumably', and such words. By<br>now the entries which comprise this <i>Guide</i> represent the product<br>of ten years of intermittent labor and frequent correction by myself<br>and careful readers, until I can hope that the errors which remain<br>are more mechanical than substantive.<br><br>There is one major deviation from this conservative treatment<br>of the Text. Unlike <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, whose Appendix B provides<br>precise dates for the events of the Second and Third Ages,<br><i>The Silmarillion</i> contains little exact chronological information<br>aside from sporadic indications of the passage of years ('But when<br>Tuor had lived thus in solitude as an outlaw for four years') and<br>rough dating from the first rising of the Sun. Desiring to make the<br>information concerning the First Age more compatible with that<br>for later Ages, I have taken it upon myself to coordinate these<br>indications of time into a Chronology of the First Age (Appendix<br>A). This Chronology may help to unify in the minds of read-ers<br>the episodic sequence of events and personages in the Wars of<br>Beleriand; by counting years, it also underscores the rapid collapse<br>of Beleriand after Dagor Bragollach and the tragedies of the early<br>deaths of Huor (at 31), Turin and Nienor (36 and 27), and Dior<br>(about 39). In addition, I must confess to having succumbed to the<br>scholarly joys of writing an Appendix. The dates given for the<br>First Age, therefore, both in the entries and in Appendix A, are<br>strictly my own and should be taken as approximations rather than<br>as completely trustworthy deductions; my derivation of these<br>dates is fully explained in the Appendix.<br><br>The principles involved in determining entries are fairly<br>simple. In general, any capitalized word or phrase receives a separate<br>entry unless it is a clearly identified epithet or a translation of<br>a name not used independently of the main name; thus there is an<br>entry for <i>Sulimo</i> but not for its full translation, <i>Lord of the Breath</i> of<br><i>Arda</i>, and<i> Voronwe</i> as the epithet of Steward Mardil is not listed<br>separately. In addition, certain noncapitalized items (mostly the<br>names of species and objects, such as the great spiders and ithildin)<br>have been included. Variant spellings (which in most cases reflect<br>Professor Tolkien's further development of the Eldarin languages)<br>are noted, but most variations in the use of accent marks have<br>been ignored. Page references in main entries are to significant references<br>only; cross-references usually cite the first occurrence<br>only. Geographical entries do not always cite the maps on which<br>the place in question is shown, and historical entries occasionally<br>use dates given in Appendix B without citation; in both cases the<br>references can easily be found. References to the various Indices<br>are given only when they contain new information.<br><br>When entries are genuine forms in Middle-earth languages, I<br>have indicated this, giving translations wherever I am sure of<br>them. A question mark following a language identification or<br>translation obviously indicates uncertainty. Translated Rohirric<br>(Old English) forms are occasionally translated again into modern<br>English; the language of other forms is indicated as 'tr.--' wherever<br>I felt there was a possibility of confusing them with Elvish or<br>genuine Mannish forms. However, by and large I have not indicated<br>the language of names and terms 'Anglicized' into English,<br>Germanic, or Celtic equivalents; as Appendix F of <i>The Return of<br>the King</i> suggests, most Adunaic, Rohirric, Westron, Mannish, and<br>Hobbitish forms have been so translated. In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> I<br>have assumed that English versions of Middle-earth names (e.g.,<br><i>Treebeard </i>for <i>Fangorn</i>) represent Westron forms used by Men and<br>Hobbits. But in <i>The Silmarillion</i> this is obviously not the case, since<br>Westron did not develop until the late Second Age. Here I have<br>assumed that the English versions, even though capitalized, are<br>merely translations intended for the convenience of the reader,<br>not translated Mannish names.</p><h2>Reading the Psalms with Luther</h2><p>This is an English translation of Luther&#39;s Summaries of the Psalms, 1531 which was originally done in 1993. This latest edition includes the ESV translation of the Psalms, Luther&#39;s introductions to each of the 150 psalms and a suggested schedule for reading the Psalter. The introductions demonstrate how Luther understood the Psalter as a Christ-centered book and how he used the psalms as the model for Christian prayer. Luther classifies each psalm as a psalm of prophecy, instruction, comfort, prayer, or thanksgiving and applies the message of the text to the life lived out under the cross. Luther also connects the psalms to the Ten Commandments and the petitions of the Lord&#39;s Prayer. For Luther, all aspects of the Christian&#39;s life, including the Psalms, relate to Christ and His Gospel of forgiveness, life, and salvation.</p><p>Martin Luther (1483, 1546) was a German monk, a theologian and church reformer, he is considered to be the founder of Protestantism. Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Sour Candy</h2><p>At first glance, Phil Pendleton and his son Adam are just an ordinary father and son, no different from any other. They take walks in the park together, visit county fairs, museums, and zoos, and eat overlooking the lake. Some might say the father is a little too accommodating given the lack of discipline when the child loses his temper in public. Some might say he spoils his son by allowing him to set his own bedtimes and eat candy whenever he wants. Some might say that such leniency is starting to take its toll on the father, given how his health has declined. What no one knows is that Phil is a prisoner, and that up until a few weeks ago and a chance encounter at a grocery store, he had never seen the child before in his life.

Despite his fantastic subject matter, the quality of Frazetta&#x2019;s work has not only drawn comparisons to the most brilliant of illustrators, Maxfield Parrish, Frederic Remington, Norman Rockwell, N.C. Wyeth but, even to the most brilliant of fine artists including Rembrandt and Michelangelo and, major Frazetta works sell for millions of dollars, breaking numerous records.<p><br><br>This innovator&#x2019;s work has not only inspired generations of artists, but also movies and directors including the Conan films, John Carter of Mars, the sensationally successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, Robert Rodriguez&#x2019; films including From Dusk Till Dawn, Ralph Bakshi films, the epic, award-winning Game of Thrones series, Tim Burton&#x2019;s Sleepy Hollow, Disney&#x2019;s animated Tarzan films, Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s Apocalypse Now and George Lucas&#x2019; Star Wars series.

The collection is brimming with both classic and previously unpublished works of the subjects Frazetta is best remembered for including barbarians, beasts, and buxom beauties. Game of Thrones creator George R. R. Martin said, &#x201c;Though he bears only a passing resemblance to the Cimmerian as Robert E. Howard described him, Frazetta&#x2019;s covers of the Conan paperback collections became the definitive picture of the character... still is.&#x201d; Schwarzenegger said, &#x201c;I have not been intimidated that often in my life.

It is a book by and about a sportswriter who grew up near Ebbets Field, and who had the good fortune in the 1950s to cover the Dodgers for the <i>Herald Tribune</i>. This is a book about what happened to Jackie, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, and the others when their glory days were behind them. In short, it is a book about America, about fathers and sons, prejudice and courage, triumph and disaster, and told with warmth, humor, wit, candor, and love. </p></p><p>&#34;At a point in life when one is through with boyhood, but has not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with the most marvelously appealing of teams.&#34; Sentimental because it holds such promise, and bittersweet because that promise is past, the first sentence of this masterpiece of sporting literature, first published in the early &#39;70s, sets its tone. What follows only gets better, deeper, more sentimental, and more bittersweet. The team, of course, is the mid-20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of Robinson and Snyder and Hodges and Reese, a team of great triumph and historical import composed of men whose fragile lives were filled with dignity and pathos. Roger Kahn, who covered that team for the New York Herald Tribune, makes understandable humans of his heroes as he chronicles the dreams and exploits of their young lives, beautifully intertwining them with his own, then recounts how so many of those sweet dreams curdled as the body of these once shining stars grew rusty with age and battered by experience. It is the rare sports book that cannot be contained by the limitations of its genre; it is equal parts journalism, memoir, social history, and poetry.<p>Roger Kahn, a prize-winning author, grew up in Brooklyn, where he says everybody on the boys' varsity baseball team at his prep school wanted to play for the Dodgers. None did. He has written nineteen books. Like most natives of Brooklyn, he is distressed that the Dodgers left. "In a perfect world," he says, "the Dodgers would have stayed in Brooklyn and Los Angeles would have gotten the Mets."</p></p><h2>Leviathan (The Leviathan Trilogy)</h2><p>It is the cusp of World War I. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans have their Clankers, steam-driven iron machines loaded with guns and ammunition. The British Darwinists employ genetically fabricated animals as their weaponry. Their <i>Leviathan</i> is a whale airship, and the most masterful beast in the British fleet.<br> <br>Aleksandar Ferdinand, a Clanker, and Deryn Sharp, a Darwinist, are on opposite sides of the war. But their paths cross in the most unexpected way, taking them both aboard the Leviathan on a fantastical, around-the-world adventure....One that will change both their lives forever.</p><p>Scott Westerfeld is the author of the Leviathan series, the first book of which was the winner of the 2010 Locus Award for Best Young Adult Fiction. His other novels include the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>Afterworlds</i>, the worldwide bestselling&nbsp;Uglies series,&nbsp;<i>The Last Days</i>,&nbsp;<i>Peeps</i>,&nbsp;<i>So Yesterday</i>, and the Midnighters trilogy.

See his work at KeithThompsonArt.com.Leviathan ONE <p></p> <br>The Austrian horses glinted in the moonlight, their riders standing tall in the saddle, swords raised. Behind them two ranks of diesel-powered walking machines stood ready to fire, cannon aimed over the heads of the cavalry. A zeppelin scouted no-man&#x2019;s-land at the center of the battlefield, its metal skin sparkling.<br> <br>The French and British infantry crouched behind their fortifications&#x2014;a letter opener, an ink jar, and a line of fountain pens&#x2014;knowing they stood no chance against the might of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But a row of Darwinist monsters loomed behind them, ready to devour any who dared retreat.<br> <br>The attack had almost begun when Prince Aleksandar thought he heard someone outside his door... .<br> <br>He took a guilty step toward his bed&#x2014;then froze in place, listening hard. Trees stirred in a soft breeze outside, but otherwise the night was silent. Mother and Father were in Sarajevo, after all. The servants wouldn&#x2019;t dare disturb his sleep.<br> <br><br> <br>Alek turned back to his desk and began to move the cavalry forward, grinning as the battle neared its climax. The Austrian walkers had completed their bombardment, and it was time for the tin horses to finish off the woefully outnumbered French. It had taken all night to set up the attack, using an imperial tactics manual borrowed from Father&#x2019;s study.<br> <br>It seemed only fair that Alek have some fun while his parents were off watching military maneuvers. He&#x2019;d begged to be taken along, to see the mustered ranks of soldiers striding past in real life, to feel the rumble of massed fighting machines through the soles of his boots.<br> <br>It was Mother, of course, who had forbidden it&#x2014;his studies were more important than &#x201c;parades,&#x201d; as she called them. She didn&#x2019;t understand that military exercises had more to teach him than musty old tutors and their books. One day soon Alek might be piloting one of those machines.<br> <br>War was coming, after all. Everyone said so.<br> <br>The last tin cavalry unit had just crashed into the French lines when the soft sound came from the hallway again: jingling, like a ring of keys.<br> <br>Alek turned, peering at the gap beneath his bed chamber&#x2019;s double doors. Shadows shifted along the sliver of moonlight, and he heard the hiss of whispers.<br> <br>Someone was right outside.<br> <br>Silent in bare feet, he swiftly crossed the cold marble floor, sliding into bed just as the door creaked open. Alek narrowed his eyes to a slit, wondering which of the servants was checking on him.<br> <br>Moonlight spilled into the room, making the tin soldiers on his desk glitter. Someone slipped inside, graceful and dead silent. The figure paused, staring at Alek for a moment, then crept toward his dresser. Alek heard the wooden rasp of a drawer sliding open.<br> <br>His heart raced. None of the servants would dare steal from him!<br> <br>But what if the intruder were something worse than a thief? His father&#x2019;s warnings echoed in his ears... .<br> <br><i>You have had enemies from the day you were born.</i><br> <br>A bell cord hung next to his bed, but his parents&#x2019; rooms were empty. With Father and his bodyguard in Sarajevo, the closest sentries were quartered at the other end of the trophy hall, fifty meters away.<br> <br>Alek slid one hand under his pillow, until his fingers touched the cold steel of his hunting knife. He lay there holding his breath, grasping the handle tightly, repeating to himself his father&#x2019;s other watchword.<br> <br><i>Surprise is more valuable than strength.</i><br> <br>Another figure came through the door then, boots clomping, a piloting jacket&#x2019;s metal clips jingling like keys on a ring. The figure tromped straight toward his bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Young master! Wake up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek let go of the knife, expelling a sigh of relief. It was just old Otto Klopp, his master of mechaniks.<br> <br>The first figure began rifling through the dresser, pulling at clothes.<br> <br>&#x201c;The young prince has been awake all along,&#x201d; Wildcount Volger&#x2019;s low voice said. &#x201c;A bit of advice, Your Highness? When pretending to be asleep, it is advisable not to hold one&#x2019;s breath.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek sat up and scowled. His fencing master had an annoying knack for seeing through deception.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the meaning of this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re to come with us, young master,&#x201d; Otto mumbled, studying the marble floor. &#x201c;The archduke&#x2019;s orders.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My father? He&#x2019;s back already?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He left instructions,&#x201d; Count Volger said with the same infuriating tone he used during fencing lessons. He tossed a pair of Alek&#x2019;s trousers and a piloting jacket onto the bed.<br> <br>Alek stared at them, half outraged and half confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like young Mozart,&#x201d; Otto said softly. &#x201c;In the arch-duke&#x2019;s stories.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek frowned, remembering Father&#x2019;s favorite tales about the great composer&#x2019;s upbringing. Supposedly Mozart&#x2019;s tutors would wake him in the middle of the night, when his mind was raw and defenseless, and thrust musical lessons upon him. It all sounded rather disrespectful to Alek.<br> <br>He reached for the trousers. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to make me compose a <i>fugue</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An amusing thought,&#x201d; Count Volger said. &#x201c;But please make haste.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have a walker waiting behind the stables, young master.&#x201d; Otto&#x2019;s worried face made an attempt at a smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re to take the helm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A walker?&#x201d; Alek&#x2019;s eyes widened. Piloting was one part of his studies he&#x2019;d gladly get out of bed for. He slipped quickly into the clothes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, your first night lesson!&#x201d; Otto said, handing Alek his boots.<br> <br>Alek pulled them on and stood, then fetched his favorite pilot&#x2019;s gloves from the dresser, his footsteps echoing on the marble floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quietly now.&#x201d; Count Volger stood by the chamber doors. He cracked them and peered out into the hall.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re to sneak out, Your Highness!&#x201d; Otto whispered. &#x201c;Good fun, this lesson! Just like young Mozart!&#x201d;<br> <br> <br> <br>The three of them crept down the trophy hall, Master Klopp still clomping, Volger gliding along in silence. Paintings of Alek&#x2019;s ancestors, the family who had ruled Austria for six hundred years, lined the hallway, their subjects staring down with unreadable expressions. The antlers of his father&#x2019;s hunting trophies cast tangled shadows, like a moonlit forest. Every footstep was magnified by the stillness of the castle, and questions echoed in Alek&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br>Wasn&#x2019;t it dangerous, piloting a walker at night? And why was his fencing master coming along? Count Volger preferred swords and horses over soulless mechaniks, and had little tolerance for commoners like old Otto. Master Klopp had been hired for his piloting skills, not his family name.<br> <br>&#x201c;Volger ...,&#x201d; Alek began.<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>Quiet</i>, boy!&#x201d; the wildcount spat.<br> <br>Anger flashed inside Alek, and a curse almost burst from his mouth, even if it ruined their stupid game of sneaking out.<br> <br>It was always like this. To the servants he might be &#x201c;the young archduke,&#x201d; but nobles like Volger never let Alek forget his position. Thanks to his mother&#x2019;s common blood, he wasn&#x2019;t fit to inherit royal lands and titles. His father might be heir to an empire of fifty million souls, but Alek was heir to nothing.<br> <br>Volger himself was only a wildcount&#x2014;no farmlands to his name, just a bit of forest&#x2014;but even he could feel superior to the son of a lady-in-waiting.<br> <br>Alek managed to stay quiet, though, letting his anger cool as they stole through the vast and darkened banquet kitchens. Years of insults had taught him how to bite his tongue, and disrespect was easier to swallow with the prospect of piloting ahead.<br> <br>One day he would have his revenge. Father had promised. The marriage contract would be changed somehow, and Alek&#x2019;s blood made royal.<br> <br>Even if it meant defying the emperor himself.<br><br>Leviathan TWO <p></p> <br>By the time they reached the stables, Alek&#x2019;s only concern was tripping in the darkness. The moon was less than half full, and the estate&#x2019;s hunting forests stretched like a black sea across the valley. At this hour even the lights of Prague had died out to a mere inkling.<br> <br>When Alek saw the walker, a soft cry escaped his lips.<br> <br>It stood taller than the stable&#x2019;s roof, its two metal feet sunk deep into the soil of the riding paddock. It looked like one of the Darwinist monsters skulking in the darkness.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t some training machine&#x2014;it was a real engine of war, a Cyklop Stormwalker. A cannon was mounted in its belly, and the stubby noses of two Spandau machine guns sprouted from its head, which was as big as a smokehouse.<br> <br>Before tonight Alek had piloted only unarmed runabouts and four-legged training corvettes. Even with his sixteenth birthday almost here, Mother always insisted that he was too young for war machines.<br><br><br> <br>&#x201c;STEALING AWAY.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to pilot <i>that</i>?&#x201d; Alek heard his own voice break. &#x201c;My old runabout wouldn&#x2019;t come up to its knee!&#x201d;<br> <br>Otto Klopp&#x2019;s gloved hand patted his shoulder heavily. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, young Mozart. I&#x2019;ll be at your side.&#x201d;<br> <br>Count Volger called up to the machine, and its engines rumbled to life, the ground trembling under Alek&#x2019;s feet. Moonlight shivered from the wet leaves in the camouflage nets draped over the Stormwalker, and the mutter of nervous horses came from the stable.<br> <br>The belly hatch swung open and a chain ladder tumbled out, unrolling as it fell. Count Volger stilled it from swinging, then planted a boot on the lowermost metal rung to hold it steady.<br> <br>&#x201c;Young master, if you please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek stared up at the machine. He tried to imagine guiding this monster through the darkness, crushing trees, buildings, and anything else unlucky enough to be in his path.<br> <br>Otto Klopp leaned closer. &#x201c;Your father the archduke has thrown us a challenge, me and you. He wants you ready to pilot any machine in the House Guard, even in the middle of the night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek swallowed. Father always said that, with war on the horizon, everyone in the household had to be prepared. And it made sense to begin training while Mother was away. If Alek crashed the walker, the worst bruises might fade before the princess Sophie returned.<br> <br>But Alek still hesitated. The belly hatch of the rumbling machine looked like the jaws of some giant predator bending down to take a bite.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, we cannot force you, Your Serene Highness,&#x201d; Count Volger said, amusement in his voice. &#x201c;We can always explain to your father that you were too scared.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> scared.&#x201d; Alek grabbed the ladder and hoisted himself up. The sawtooth rungs gripped his gloves as Alek climbed past the anti-boarding spikes arrayed along the walker&#x2019;s belly. He crawled into the machine&#x2019;s dark maw, the smell of kerosene and sweat filling his nose, the engines&#x2019; rhythm trembling in his bones.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome aboard, Your Highness,&#x201d; a voice said. Two men waited in the gunners&#x2019; cabin, steel helmets glittering. A Stormwalker carried a crew of five, Alek recalled. This wasn&#x2019;t some little three-man runabout. He almost forgot to return their salutes.<br> <br>Count Volger was close behind him on the ladder, so Alek kept climbing up into the command cabin. He took the pilot&#x2019;s seat, strapping himself in as Klopp and Volger followed.<br> <br>He placed his hands on the saunters, feeling the machine&#x2019;s awesome power trembling in his fingers. Strange to think that these two small levers could control the walker&#x2019;s huge metal legs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Vision at full,&#x201d; Klopp said, cranking the viewport open as wide as it would go. The cool night air spilled into the Stormwalker&#x2019;s cabin, and moonlight fell across dozens of switches and levers.<br> <br>The four-legged corvette he&#x2019;d piloted the month before had needed only control saunters, a fuel gauge, and a compass. But now uncountable needles were arrayed before him, shivering like nervous whiskers.<br> <br>What were they all <i>for</i>?<br> <br>He pulled his eyes from the controls and stared through the viewport. The distance to the ground gave him a queasy feeling, like peering down from a hayloft with thoughts of jumping.<br> <br>The edge of the forest loomed only twenty meters away. Did they really expect him to pilot this machine through those dense trees and tangled roots ... <i>at night</i>?<br> <br>&#x201c;At your pleasure, young master,&#x201d; Count Volger said, sounding bored already.<br> <br>Alek set his jaw, resolving not to provide the man with any more amusement. He eased the saunters forward, and the huge Daimler engines changed pitch as steel gears bit, grinding into motion.<br> <br>The Stormwalker rose from its crouch slowly, the ground slipping still farther away. Alek could see across the treetops now, all the way to shimmering Prague.<br> <br>He pulled the left saunter back and pushed the right forward. The machine lumbered into motion with an inhumanly large step, pressing him back into the pilot&#x2019;s seat.<br> <br>The right pedal rose a little as the walker&#x2019;s foot hit soft ground, nudging Alek&#x2019;s boot. He twisted at the saunters, transferring weight from one foot to the other. The cabin swayed like a tree house in a high wind, lurching back and forth with each giant step. A chorus of hissing came from the engines below, gauges dancing as the Stormwalker&#x2019;s pneumatic joints strained against the machine&#x2019;s weight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good ... excellent,&#x201d; Otto muttered from the commander&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;Watch your knee pressure, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alek dared a glance down at the controls, but had no idea what Master Klopp was talking about. <i>Knee pressure?</i> How could anyone keep track of all those needles without driving the whole contraption into a tree?<br> <br>&#x201c;Better,&#x201d; the man said a few steps later. Alek nodded dumbly, overjoyed that he hadn&#x2019;t tipped them over yet.<br> <br>Already the forest was looming up, filling the wide-open viewport with a dark tangle of shapes. The first glistening branches swept past, thwacking at the viewport, spattering Alek with cold showers of dew.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we spark up the running lights?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Klopp shook his head. &#x201c;Remember, young master? We&#x2019;re pretending we don&#x2019;t want to be spotted.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Revolting way to travel,&#x201d; Volger muttered, and Alek wondered again why the man was here. Was there to be a <i>fencing</i> lesson after this? What sort of warrior-Mozart was his father trying to make him into?<br> <br>The shriek of grinding gears filled the cabin. The left pedal snapped up against Alek&#x2019;s foot, and the whole machine tipped ominously forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re caught, young master!&#x201d; Otto said, hands ready to snatch the saunters away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I <i>know</i>!&#x201d; Alek cried, twisting at the controls. He slammed the machine&#x2019;s right foot down midstride, its knee joint spitting air like a train whistle. The Stormwalker wavered drunkenly for a moment, threatening to fall. But long seconds later Alek felt the machine&#x2019;s weight settle into the moss and dirt. It was balanced with one foot stretching back, like a fencer posing after a lunge.<br> <br>He pushed on both saunters, the left leg pulling at whatever had entan...</p><h2>Dear Evan Hansen (TCG Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the 2017 Tony Award for Best Musical</strong></p><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> lodges in your head long after you&#x2019;ve seen it or heard it or read it.

Rarely&#x2014;scratch that&#x2014;never have I heard so many stifled sobs and sniffles in the theater. For those allergic to synthetic sentiment, rest assured that the show, with a haunting score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, matched by a book of equal sensitivity by Steven Levenson, doesn&#x2019;t sledgehammer home its affecting story. On the contrary, the musical finds endless nuances in the relationships among its characters, and makes room for some leavening humor too. The musical is ideal for families looking for something more complex than the usual sugary diversions. But then it should also appeal to just about anyone who has ever felt, at some point in life, that he or she was trapped &#x201c;on the outside looking in,&#x201d; as one lyric has it. Which is just about everybody with a beating heart.&#x201d; &#x2013;Charles Isherwood, <em>New York Times</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Ravishingly bittersweet...

The kids had slept little. They had packed all night, tossed and turned in their beds, hopped out long before sunrise, showered, packed some more, awakened their parents, pushed for a quick breakfast, and in general acted as hyper as a bunch of five-year-olds waiting for Santa. At six a.m., as instructed, they all arrived at the school at the same time. They were greeted by the awesome sight of four long, sleek, matching tour buses in perfect single file with running lights glittering in the dark and diesel engines purring.</p><p>The Eighth-Grade Field Trip! Six hours by bus to Washington, DC, for three-and-a-half days of seeing the sights and four nights of mischief in a high-rise hotel. For this, the students had worked for months&#x2014;selling doughnuts on Saturday mornings, washing a thousand cars, cleaning roadside ditches and recycling the aluminum cans, soliciting the same downtown merchants who contributed every year, selling fruitcakes door-to-door at Christmas, auctioning used sports equipment, holding bake-a-thons and bike-a-thons and book-a-thons, and pursuing with enthusiasm any number of mildly profitable ventures approved by the Field Trip Committee. All proceeds went into the same pot. The goal had been ten thousand dollars, certainly not enough to cover all expenses but enough to guarantee the trip. This year the class had raised almost twelve thousand dollars, which meant that each student was assessed $125.</p><p>There were a few students who could not afford this. However, the school had a long tradition of making sure no one was left behind. Every single eighth grader was headed to Washington, along with ten teachers and eight parents.</p><p>Theodore Boone was thrilled that his mother had not volunteered for the trip. They had discussed it over dinner. His father had quickly bowed out, claiming, as usual, that he simply had too much work. Theo&#x2019;s mother, at first, seemed interested in tagging along, but soon realized she could not. Theo checked her trial calendar at the office and knew full well she would be in court while he was having a ball in Washington.</p><p>As they waited in traffic, Theo sat in the front seat and stroked the head of his dog, Judge, who was sitting partially on the console and partially in Theo&#x2019;s lap. Judge usually sat wherever he wanted, and none of the Boones told him otherwise.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you excited?&#x201d; Mr. Boone asked. He had drop-off duty because Mrs. Boone had gone back to bed for another hour of sleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Theo said, trying to hide his excitement. &#x201c;A long bus ride, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you guys&#x2019;ll be asleep before you get out of town. We&#x2019;ve gone over the rules. Any questions?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been through this a dozen times,&#x201d; Theo said, mildly frustrated. He liked his parents. They were a bit older than average, and he was an only child, and at times they seemed a little too protective. One of the few things that irritated Theo about them was their fondness of rules. All rules, regardless of who made them, must be followed perfectly.</p><p>Theo suspected this was because they were both lawyers.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Just follow the rules, do what your teachers tell you, and don&#x2019;t do anything stupid. Remember what happened two years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>How could Theo, or any other eighth grader, ever forget what happened two years ago? Two bozos&#x2014;Jimbo Nance and Duck DeFoe&#x2014;dropped water balloons from a fifth-floor hotel room into the indoor lobby far below. No one was hurt, but some folks got really wet, and really mad. A snitch turned them in, and the boys&#x2019; parents had to drive six hours in the middle of the night to retrieve them. Then six hours back to Strattenburg. Jimbo said it was a very long drive. They were suspended from classes for a week, and the school was told to find another hotel for future field trips. This misadventure was now legendary around town, and it was used to caution and frighten Theo and every other eighth grader headed to Washington.</p><p>They finally parked. Theo said good-bye to Judge and told him to stay in the front seat. Mr. Boone opened a rear door and removed Theo&#x2019;s luggage&#x2014;one nylon overnight bag that was supposed to weigh under twenty pounds. Anything over twenty pounds would be left behind (one of the Big Rules!), and the guilty kid would be forced to make the trip without the benefit of clean clothes and a toothbrush. This would not have bothered Theo in the least. He had survived a week in the woods with the Boy Scouts with less equipment. </p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Mr. Mount was standing by a bus with some scales, weighing other luggage as it was loaded into storage. He was smiling and laughing, as excited as his students. Theo&#x2019;s bag weighed nineteen pounds, eight ounces. His backpack barely made the limit at twelve pounds, and Theo was in business. Mr. Mount checked the overnight bag for an ID card and told Theo to get on the bus.</p><p>Theo shook his father&#x2019;s hand, said good-bye, froze for a moment, terrified his father might try to hug him or something awful like that, then breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Boone said, &#x201c;Have fun. Call your mother.&#x201d; Theo scampered aboard.</p><p>Close by, the girls were saying good-bye to their mothers with all manner of embracing, blubbering, and carrying on as if they were going off to war and would probably never come home. By the boys&#x2019; buses, though, the tough guys stiffened and tried to get away quickly from their parents with as little contact as possible. </p><p>The parking lot slowly cleared as the sun rose. At precisely seven a.m., the four buses rolled away from the school. It was Thursday. The big day had finally arrived, and the kids were noisy and rowdy. His seatmate was Chase Whipple, a close friend who was often referred to as &#x201c;The Mad Scientist.&#x201d; To prevent them from getting lost and wandering through the dangerous streets of DC, the teachers had implemented the Buddy System. For the next four days Theo would be stuck with Chase, and Chase with Theo, and each was supposed to know what the other was doing at all times. Theo knew he got the bad end of the deal because Chase often got lost on the campus of the Strattenburg Middle School. Keeping an eye on him would take some work. They would share a room with Woody Lambert and Aaron Nyquist.</p><p>As the buses eased through the quiet streets, the boys chattered excitedly. No one had yet thrown a punch or yanked off someone else&#x2019;s cap. They had been threatened about misbehaving, and Mr. Mount was watching them closely. Then someone behind Theo passed gas, and loudly. This was instantly contagious, and before they were out of Strattenburg Theo wished he could have been sitting with April Finnemore on the other bus just ahead.</p><p>Mr. Mount cracked a window. Things eventually settled down. Thirty minutes into the trip, the boys were either asleep or lost in video games.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Theo&#x2019;s room was on the eighth floor of a new hotel on Connecticut Avenue, about a half mile north of the White House. From his window, he, along with Chase, Woody, and Aaron, had a clear view of the top half of the Washington Monument rising above the city. According to their schedule, the boys would climb to the top of the monument first thing Saturday morning. But for now, they had to hurry downstairs for a quick lunch, then, they would be off to see the sights.</p><p>Each student was allowed to pick and choose from the many attractions in Washington. It would take a year of serious work to see everything, so Mr. Mount and the other teachers had put together a list from which the students could select their favorites. </p><p>April had convinced Theo that they should see Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, the place where Abraham Lincoln was shot, and this seemed like an interesting idea. Theo convinced Chase, and after lunch they gathered in the hotel lobby with Mr. Babcock, a history teacher, and a group of eighteen students. Mr. Babcock explained that they would not be taking one of the buses because their group was small. Rather, they would get to experience the DC subway system, known as the Metro. He asked how many of the students had ever ridden on a subway. Theo and three others raised their hands.</p><p>They left the hotel and began walking along a busy sidewalk. For kids who lived in a small town, the sounds and energy of a big city were at first hard to absorb. So many big buildings, so many cars bumper to bumper in traffic that hardly moved, so many people bustling along the sidewalks, all anxious to get somewhere. At the Woodley Park Metro Station, they rode the escalator down, far below the streets. Mr. Babcock had plastic SmarTrip cards that would give the students limited use of the Metro system. Their train was half-empty, clean, and efficient. As it zipped along the dark tunnel, April whispered to Theo that it was her first time on a subway. Theo said he&#x2019;d been on one before in New York, when his parents took him there on vacation. The New York system, though, was far different from DC&#x2019;s.</p><p>When the train stopped for the third time, just minutes after they had started, it was time to get off at the Metro Center Station. They hurried up the steps and back into the sunlight. Mr. Babcock counted eighteen kids, and they began walking. Minutes later they were on 10th Street.</p><p>Mr. Babcock stopped the group and pointed across the street to a handsome redbrick building that was obviously important. He said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, the place where President Lincoln was shot on April 14, 1865. As you know, because you all have spent so much time doing your history assignments, the Civil War had just ended; in fact, General Lee had surrendered to General Grant only five days earlier at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. The city of Washington was in a good mood, the war was finally over, and so President and Mrs. Lincoln decided to have a night out on the town. Ford&#x2019;s Theatre was the grandest, most magnificent theatre in town, and the Lincolns came here often for concerts and plays. At the time, the theatre had over two thousand seats, and the play, one called <i>Our American Cousin</i>, was selling out every night.&#x201d;</p><p>They walked half a block and stopped again. Mr. Babcock resumed with, &#x201c;Now, the war may have been over, but a lot of folks didn&#x2019;t think so. One was a Confederate named John Wilkes Booth. He was a well-known actor, and he was even photographed with President Lincoln during his second inauguration, a month earlier. Mr. Booth was upset because the South had surrendered, and he was desperate to do something to help its cause. So he decided to kill President Lincoln. Because he was known to the theatre personnel, he was allowed to approach the box where the Lincolns were sitting. He shot the president once in the back of the head, jumped onto the stage, broke his leg, then, escaped out the back door.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Babcock turned and nodded at the building beside them. He said, &#x201c;This is the Petersen House, which at that time was a boardinghouse. They brought President Lincoln over here, where he was attended to by his doctors throughout the night. Word spread quickly. A crowd gathered, and federal troops were used to keep people away from the house. President Lincoln died here on the morning of April 15, 1865.&#x201d;</p><p>Enough of the lecture. They finally crossed the street and entered Ford&#x2019;s Theatre.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>After two hours, Theo had had enough of the Lincoln killing. It was certainly interesting and all that, and he appreciated the historical importance, but it was time to move on. The coolest thing was down in the museum, under the stage, where they displayed the actual gun Booth used.</p><p>It was almost four thirty when they emerged onto 10th Street and headed back to the Metro Center Station. The traffic was even heavier, the sidewalks more crowded. Their train was packed with commuters headed home and seemed to move a lot slower. Theo was standing in the middle of the car, in a crowd, with Chase and April close by, as the train rocked and clicked along the tracks. He glanced around him at the glum faces of the commuters; no one was smiling. They all looked tired. He wasn&#x2019;t sure where he would live when he grew up, but he didn&#x2019;t think it would be in a big city. Strattenburg seemed the perfect size. Not too big, not too small. No traffic jams. No angry horn blowing. No crowded sidewalks. He didn&#x2019;t want to ride a train to and from work.</p><p>A man seated tightly between two women lowered his newspaper as he flipped a page. He was less than ten feet away from Theo.</p><p>He looked familiar, oddly familiar. Theo took a deep breath and managed to wiggle between two men bunched together with the others. A few feet closer now, and he could see the man&#x2019;s face.</p><p>He&#x2019;d seen it before, but where? There was something different about it, maybe the hair was darker, maybe the reading glasses were new. Suddenly, it struck Theo like a brick against the head: The face belonged to Pete Duffy.</p><p>Pete Duffy? The most wanted man in the history of Strattenburg and Stratten County. Number seven on the FBI&#x2019;s Ten Most Wanted. The man who&#x2019;d been accused of murdering his wife, had gone to trial in Strattenburg, in front of Judge Henry Gantry, a trial that Theo and his classmates had actually watched. The man who&#x2019;d barely escaped a conviction when Judge Gantry declared a mistrial. The man who&#x2019;d fled town in the middle of the night and had not been heard from since.</p><p>The man lowered the newspaper again as he flipped another page. He glanced around as Theo ducked behind another commuter. They had exchanged stares just after the trial. </p><p>Duffy had a mustache now, one sprinkled with gray whiskers. His face disappeared again behind the newspaper.</p><p>Theo was paralyzed with uncertainty. He had no idea what to do. The train stopped and more commuters piled on. It stopped again at the Dupont Circle Station. The Woodley Park Station was next. Duffy showed no signs of getting off. He did not appear to have a briefcase or bag or satchel like the other commuters. Theo squirmed his way down the train, putting a few more feet between himself and his classmates. Chase was lost in another world, as usual. April could not be seen. He could hear Mr. Babcock tell the students to get ready to get off. Theo moved farther away.</p><p>At the Woodley Park Station, the train stopped and the doors flew open. More commuters rushed on as the students scrambled to get off. In the melee, no one noticed that Theo was still on the train. The doors closed and it took off again. He kept his eyes on Pete Duffy, who was ducking behind the newspaper, probably a habit now. At the Cleveland Park Station, a few more passengers got on. Theo sent a text message to Chase explaining that he had been unable to get off, and that he was okay. He&#x2019;d simply catch another train back to Woodley Park. Chase called immediately but Theo kept his phone on mute. He was sure Mr. Babcock was panicked. He would return the call in just a few minutes.</p><p>Theo began toying w...</p></p><h2>Jack Reacher&#39;s Rules</h2><p><i>Jack Reacher&#x2019;s Rules </i>is the ultimate fan&#x2019;s guide to the World of Reacher!

So begins Charlotte Pomerantz's irresistibly catchy verse story <i>The Piggy in the Puddle</i>. It's the classic "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em" tale, as the little she-piggy's father, mother, and brother take turns exhorting her to exit the mud puddle in which she is frolicking, only to have her respond with a happy "Nope!" One by one, they give up and plunge into the puddle where they too discover the joys of the "squishy-squashy, mooshy-squooshy, oofy-poofy" mud.<p> James Marshall, creator of the George and Martha books, provides the perfect visual accompaniments. True to form, he depicts the admonishing father pig ("See her daddy, / Fuddy-duddy, fuddy-duddy, fuddy-duddy. / 'Don't you get all muddy, / Muddy muddy muddy muddy") as a large, fez-wearing, mustachio-sporting hog, standing on a box of soap. All you can see of the scolded little pig is the end of her snout and the word "Nope!" Young children will delight in the silly, repetitive verse of this Reading Rainbow Book--and of course the forbidden pleasures of being in the middle of a messy, messy muddle. (Excellent read-aloud for preschoolers, but perfect for early readers ages 4 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Charlotte Pomerantz is the author of thirty-five books for children, including <i>The Piggy in the Puddle. </i>Her books <i>Posy </i>and <i>The Mousery </i>each won Christopher Awards.

Tokyo Bunnie<br><br>"The eight cuddly underwater explorers from The Octonauts and the Sea of Shade (2007) take a vacation to the Great Reef City only to discover the wondrous reef ecosystem has become bereft of both life and color. They learn that coral is actually made up of thousands of little creatures, and the buildings built on top of the reef have strangled them of sunlight. Even if children don&#x2019;t quite respond to the gentle socio-environmental message of learning to live in harmony with one&#x2019;s surroundings, the anime-inspired artwork and oodles of minute details bubbling around each page will have them deeply immersed in the fantastical undersea world." -American Library Association, Booklist<br><br>This is the original book series that launched the animated TV show, which is now popular worldwide and broadcast on the Disney Channel in the USA.

Are you constantly searching for something you can&#x2019;t put your finger on, or wondering whether you are living a life that truly fits? In Archetypes: Who Are You?, New York Times best-selling author Caroline Myss delves into the world of archetypes, which have been the subject of her work for more than 25 years. Archetypes are universal patterns of behavior that, once discovered, help you better understand yourself and your place in the world. In short, knowing your archetypes can transform your life. Within the pages of this book, Myss writes about ten primary feminine archetypes that have emerged in today&#x2019;s society: the Caregiver, the Artist/Creative, the Fashionista, the Intellectual, the Rebel, the Queen/Executive, the Advocate, the Visionary, the Athlete, and the Spiritual Seeker. In each chapter, she explains one individual archetype, showing how it has evolved and then in fascinating detail lays out the unique characteristics, the defining graces, the life challenges, and other information to help you understand if you are part of this archetype family and if so, how you can fully tap into its power. She also offers tips and practical advice on how to fully engage with your archetypes. Learning which archetypes best describe you is just the beginning. You can then use this knowledge to make more conscious decisions about everything from careers to relationships, avoiding common pitfalls of your personality type while playing up your strengths. The result is a happier, more authentic you. It&#x2019;s never too late to change your life by embracing your archetypes to the fullest. So are you a Rebel? An Artist? A Visionary?

Ware</strong> (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) is professor of Christian theology at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. He has written numerous journal articles, book chapters, book reviews, and has authored <em>God's Lesser Glory</em>, <em>God's Greater Glory</em>, and <em>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</em></p><p>"This is a great book for children and their parents on the classic doctrines of the faith. I heartily recommend it to every parent!"<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dennis Rainey</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;President and CEO, FamilyLife; Host, <em>FamilyLife Today</em>; author, <em>Stepping Up</em></p><p>"My conversion and discipleship as a young girl were significantly influenced by my parents reading to our family a book that taught biblical doctrine to children in a systematic way. The church today must be intentional in passing on to the next generation the core and precious beliefs on which our Christian faith rests. To neglect that responsibility is to leave those who come behind us vulnerable to every wind of (false) doctrine and to risk their rejecting our faith altogether. Big Truths for Young Hearts is a rich resource for parents, teachers, and others who care about helping the next generation know and love God and his ways. In addition to being a theology course for children and young people, it is also a great refresher course for adults."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth</strong><strong>,</strong> author; Bible teacher; host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em>&nbsp;</p><p>"Imagine a respected theologian devoting himself to training a new generation of pastors and scholars in the seminary classroom. Now imagine him driving home at night to teach that profound theology in simple terms to his children at their bedsides. Now imagine this father compiling those bedside conversations into a book available to all pastors, parents, and children alike. Imagine no more. My friend Dr. Bruce Ware has done it."<br>&#x2015;<strong>C.J. Mahaney</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville</p><p>"I praise God that this book has been written and that a person of Bruce Ware's theological stature has taken seriously the potential of theological training in the first two decades of life. Although this tool can serve different instructional venues, I cannot help but see the gift this is to Christian parents and to dads in particular who are charged with the spiritual instruction of their children. The foreword alone is worth the price of this book and more than enough inspiration to follow Bruce's example in the faithful instruction of his two daughters. What Christian father would not want to be remembered by his adult children as a man who loved the gospel and who faithfully imparted the truth on which they now firmly stand. Dear brothers, imagine the impact on future generations if our children could grasp what has taken some of us decades to understand. Take this beautifully written, Bible-saturated, God-centered, theologically comprehensive summary of the truth and teach it diligently to your children, and until your children leave your home talk of it when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up."<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Michael</strong>,&nbsp;Founder, Children Desiring God, Minneapolis, MN</p></p><h2>Warriors: Tales from the Clans (Warriors Novella)</h2><p><p>Three novellas featuring the cats of Erin Hunter's #1 bestselling Warriors series&#x2014;together in print for the first time!

In <em>Grateful</em>, Diana Butler Bass untangles our conflicting understandings of gratitude and sets the table for a renewed practice of giving thanks. </p><p>We know that gratitude is good, but many of us find it hard to sustain a meaningful life of gratefulness. Four out of five Americans report feeling gratitude on a regular basis, but those private feelings seem disconnected from larger concerns of our public lives.

Using her trademark blend of historical research, spiritual insights, and timely cultural observation, she shows how we can overcome this gap and make change in our own lives and in the world.</p><p>With honest stories and heartrending examples from history and her own life, Bass reclaims gratitude as a path to greater connection with god, with others, with the world, and even with our own souls.

Reformer Martin Luther designed both the Small and Large Catechisms to help Christians grow in the knowledge of God and the Gospel.

Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>The Gospel of John (Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture)</h2><p>In this addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture, two well-respected New Testament scholars interpret the Gospel of John in its historical and literary setting as well as in light of the Church&#39;s doctrinal, liturgical, and spiritual tradition.

You just didn&#x2019;t get that kind of mustache at home.<br><br> I couldn&#x2019;t tear my eyes from it. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br><br> The only person I had ever seen with a mustache like that at home was Mr. Naylor, our maths teacher, and he collected Digestive crumbs in his&#x2014;we used to count them during algebra.<br><br> &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. Sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> The man in the uniform motioned me forward with a flick of his stubby finger. He did not look up from his screen. I waited at the booth, long-haul sweat drying gently into my dress. He held up his hand, waggling four fat fingers. This, I grasped after several seconds, was a demand for my passport.<br><br> &#x201c;Name.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s there,&#x201d; I said. <br><br> &#x201c;Your name, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Louisa Elizabeth Clark.&#x201d; I peered over the counter. &#x201c;Though I never use the Elizabeth bit. Because my mum realized after they named me that that would make me Lou Lizzy. And if you say that really fast it sounds like lunacy. Though my dad says that&#x2019;s kind of fitting. Not that I&#x2019;m a lunatic. I mean, you wouldn&#x2019;t want lunatics in your country. Hah!&#x201d; My voice bounced nervously off the Plexiglas screen.<br><br> The man looked at me for the first time. He had solid shoulders and a gaze that could pin you like a Tazer. He did not smile. He waited until my own faded.<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;People in uniform make me nervous.&#x201d;<br><br> I glanced behind me at the immigration hall, at the snaking queue that had doubled back on itself so many times it had become an impenetrable, restless sea of people. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m feeling a bit odd from standing in that queue. That is honestly the longest queue I&#x2019;ve ever stood in. I&#x2019;d begun to wonder whether to start my Christmas list.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Put your hand on the scanner.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Is it always that size?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The scanner?&#x201d; He frowned. <br><br> &#x201c;The queue.&#x201d;<br><br> But he was no longer listening. He was studying something on his screen. I put my fingers on the little pad. And then my phone dinged.<br><br> Mum: Have you landed?<br><br> I went to tap an answer with my free hand but he turned sharply toward me. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, you are not permitted to use cell phones in this area.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just my mum. She wants to know if I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; I surreptitiously tried to press the thumbs-up emoji as I slid the phone out of view.<br><br> &#x201c;Reason for travel?&#x201d;<br><br> What is that? came Mum&#x2019;s immediate reply. She had taken to texting like a duck to water and could now do it faster than she could speak. Which was basically warp speed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;You know my phone doesn&#x2019;t do the little pictures. Is that an SOS? Louisa tell me you&#x2019;re okay.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reasons for travel, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; The mustache twitched with irritation.<br><br>He added, slowly: &#x201c;What are you doing here in the United States?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I have a new job.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to work for a family in New York. Central Park.&#x201d;<br><br> Just briefly, the man&#x2019;s eyebrows might have raised a millimeter. He checked the address on my form, confirming it. &#x201c;What kind of job?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit complicated. But I&#x2019;m sort of a paid companion.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;A <i>paid companion.&#x201d;<br></i><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like this. I used to work for this man. I was his companion, but I would also give him his meds and take him out and feed him. That&#x2019;s not as weird as it sounds, by the way&#x2014;he had no use of his hands. It wasn&#x2019;t like something pervy. Actually my last job ended up as more than that, because it&#x2019;s hard not to get close to people you look after and Will&#x2014;the man&#x2014;was amazing and we . . . Well, we fell in love.&#x201d; Too late, I felt the familiar welling of tears. I wiped at my eyes briskly. &#x201c;So I think it&#x2019;ll be sort of like that. Except for the love bit. And the feeding.&#x201d;<br><br> The immigration officer was staring at me. I tried to smile. &#x201c;Actually, I don&#x2019;t normally cry talking about jobs. I&#x2019;m not like an actual lunatic, despite my name. Hah! But I loved him. And he loved me. And then he . . . Well, he chose to end his life. So this is sort of my attempt to start over.&#x201d; The tears were now leaking relentlessly, embarrassingly, from the corners of my eyes. I couldn&#x2019;t seem to stop them. I couldn&#x2019;t seem to stop anything. &#x201c;Sorry. Must be the jet lag. It&#x2019;s something like two o&#x2019;clock in the morning in normal time, right? Plus I don&#x2019;t really talk about him anymore. I mean, I have a new boyfriend. And he&#x2019;s great! He&#x2019;s a paramedic! And hot! That&#x2019;s like winning the boyfriend lottery, right? A hot paramedic?&#x201d;<br><br> I scrabbled around in my handbag for a tissue. When I looked up the man was holding out a box. I took one. &#x201c;Thank you. So, anyway, my friend Nathan&#x2014;he&#x2019;s from New Zealand&#x2014;works here and he helped me get this job and I don&#x2019;t really know what it involves yet, apart from looking after this rich man&#x2019;s wife who gets depressed. But I&#x2019;ve decided this time I&#x2019;m going to live up to what Will wanted for me, because before I didn&#x2019;t get it right. I just ended up working in an airport.&#x201d;<br> I froze. &#x201c;Not&#x2014;uh&#x2014;that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with working at an airport! I&#x2019;m sure immigration is a very important job. Really important. But I have a plan. I&#x2019;m going to do something new every week that I&#x2019;m here and I&#x2019;m going to say yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Say yes?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To new things. Will always said I shut myself off from new experiences. So this is my plan.&#x201d;<br><br> The officer studied my paperwork. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t fill the address section out properly. I need a zip code.&#x201d;<br><br> He pushed the form toward me. I checked the number on the sheet that I had printed out and filled it in with trembling fingers. I glanced to my left, where the queue at my section was growing restive. At the front of the next queue a Chinese family was being questioned by two officials. As the woman protested, they were led into a side room. I felt suddenly very alone.<br><br> &nbsp;The immigration officer peered at the people waiting. And then, abruptly, he stamped my passport. &#x201c;Good luck, Louisa Clark,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> I stared at him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br><br> I smiled. &#x201c;Oh, thank you! That&#x2019;s really kind. I mean, it&#x2019;s quite weird being on the other side of the world by yourself for the first time, and now I feel a bit like I just met my first nice new person and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You need to move along now, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> I gathered up my belongings and pushed a sweaty frond of hair from my face.<br><br> &#x201c;And, ma&#x2019;am . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; I wondered what I had got wrong now.<br><br> He didn&#x2019;t look up from his screen. &#x201c;Be careful what you say yes to.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Magician&#39;s Assistant</h2><p>A secretive magician&#x2019;s death becomes the catalyst for his partner&#x2019;s journey of self-discovery in this &#x201c;enchanting&#x201d; book (San Francisco Chronicle) &#x201c;that is something of a magic trick in itself-a 1990s love story with the grace and charm of a nineteenth-century novel&#x201d; (Newsweek).<br></p><p><i>The Magician's Assistant</i> sustains author Ann Patchett's proven penchant for crafting colorful characters and marrying the ordinary with the fantastic.

Waldman is a graduate of Columbia College and NYU School of Law. He comments widely in the media on law and policy.The Second Amendment INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson issued a terse announcement. Congress had established the post office. It had passed a new law governing fisheries. And the states had ratified the first ten amendments to the Constitution: the Bill of Rights.<br> <br>Jefferson&#x2019;s deadpan proclamation belied years of drama and conflict. The amendments were the product of a fierce debate over government&#x2019;s role and the rights of the people, one that unfolded since the start of the American Revolution. Even today, Americans know some parts of the Bill of Rights by heart. We cherish the First Amendment, with its guarantee of freedom of religion, speech, and the press. We debate the Fourth Amendment, with its requirement for a search warrant. All know about the right to avoid self-incrimination (&#x201c;taking the Fifth&#x201d;).<br> <br>For two centuries, however, the Second Amendment received little notice. Few citizens understood its provisions. Scholars paid it little attention. Lawyers rarely raised it in court. In recent years, of course, the Second Amendment has been thrust to the center of controversy. Politicians declare themselves its &#x201c;strong supporters.&#x201d; News reports speculate about gun laws and whether they will pass muster. It has become a synonym, in powerful unspoken ways, for America&#x2019;s gun culture.<br> <br>The Second Amendment is one sentence. It reads in its entirety:<br> <br>A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.<br> <br>Its foggy wording and odd locution stand out in the Constitution. Lawyers and scholars debate its commas and clauses. For 218 years, judges overwhelmingly concluded that the amendment authorized states to form militias, what we now call the National Guard. Then, in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upended two centuries of precedent. In the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia declared that the Constitution confers a right to own a gun for self-defense in the home. That&#x2019;s right: the Supreme Court found there to be an individual right to gun ownership just a few years ago. Now, when we debate gun control we do so in the context of a Supreme Court ruling that limits what we can do (though we don&#x2019;t yet know how much).<br> <br>Far from a dry set of words scratched on parchment, then, it turns out that the story of the Second Amendment can tell us much about how our country has changed and grown, how we see ourselves and our government, how we balance the rights of individuals and the need for safety.<br> <br>Part One of this book begins in the tumultuous years of the American Revolution and its aftermath. The Constitution was drafted in secret by a group of mostly young men, many of whom had served together in the Continental Army, and who feared the consequences of a weak central authority. They produced a charter that shifted power to a national government. &#x201c;Anti-Federalists&#x201d; opposed the Constitution. They worried, among other things, that the new government would try to disarm the thirteen state militias. Critically, those militias were a product of a world of civic duty and governmental compulsion utterly alien to us today. Every white man age sixteen to sixty was enrolled. He was required to own&#x2014;and bring&#x2014;a musket or other military weapon.<br> <br>Debate still burns about the Framers&#x2019; intent and the original meaning of the Constitution. Surprisingly, there is not a single word about an individual right to a gun for self-defense in the notes from the Constitutional Convention. Nor with scattered exceptions in the records of the ratification debates in the states. Nor on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives as it marked up the Second Amendment. James Madison&#x2019;s original proposal, in fact, included a provision for conscientious objectors.<br> <br>People ask: who is right? Did the Second Amendment protect militias, or an individual right to a gun? The answer: both, and neither. It protected the individual right to a gun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to fulfill the duty to serve in a militia. To the Framers, even our question would make little sense. To us, today, their answer makes little sense.<br> <br>As the nation spread west, guns grew abundant. (After all, one of those young Constitution writers, Alexander Hamilton, was killed in a duel!) In the years immediately following the Civil War, the authors of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted to make sure that former slaves could arm themselves to protect against organized violence from white vigilantes. But gun control laws were prevalent, too. An iconic photo of Dodge City&#x2014;that legendary frontier town&#x2014;shows a sign planted in the middle of its main street: &#x201c;The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited.&#x201d; In the twentieth century, Americans demanded a stronger government as they surged into crowded cities. Amid Prohibition and the Depression, modern gun control laws sought to rein in gangsters and the heat they packed. And, again, the courts stayed out. Chief Justice Warren Burger&#x2014;a rock-ribbed conservative appointed by Richard Nixon&#x2014;articulated the consensus when he called the idea of individual gun rights in the Constitution a preposterous &#x201c;fraud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Part Two tells the story of how that changed: how a remarkable, concerted legal campaign toppled two centuries of precedent.<br> <br>One thread, of course, is the rise of the National Rifle Association. The group brags of its ballot box victories. Starting in the 1970s, the organization also quietly&#x2014;but emphatically&#x2014;backed a jurisprudential campaign to enshrine gun rights in the Constitution. Its legal allies insisted that for two centuries judges simply got it wrong. They managed to persuade a substantial part of the public, and after that the courts. The road to Heller was paved by one of history&#x2019;s most effective, if misleading, campaigns for constitutional change.<br> <br>Heller shows something more: how a generation of conservative judges and scholars transformed the way we interpret the Constitution. &#x201c;Originalism&#x201d; asserts that the only legitimate way to interpret a constitutional provision is to ask what the Constitution meant at the time it was enacted, in the late 1700s. Its influence has peaked in the Supreme Court led by John Roberts. He assigned Scalia the 2008 gun case. Lawyers arguing before the Supreme Court now brandish obscure historical texts like graduate students defending a particularly opaque dissertation. This section will suggest that reverence for the &#x201c;text&#x201d; can be just a pretext for a particular political view.<br> <br>What now? Part Three will trace Heller&#x2019;s impact as we struggle again to curb gun violence. As before, spasms of violence spur calls for new laws. (Today, we are sickened by massacres such as the one in Newtown, Connecticut, rather than the political assassinations that prompted action before.) This is the first time, though, that Americans have debated firearm safety proposals with an individual right to own a gun enshrined in the Constitution. Will new doctrine deflect new laws? Will we all have the right to carry a weapon and stand our ground? We will examine the cases since Heller, and find a surprise: despite the hoopla surrounding the case, courts upheld nearly all gun rules. Individuals have a right to a gun, judges have found, but society has a right to protect itself, too. Yet that assumption may be premature. As Justice Robert Jackson said, the Supreme Court is not final because it is infallible, but infallible because it is final. Inevitably the Court will speak again. But the High Court&#x2019;s imprimatur has given new strength to Second Amendment fundamentalism. Increasingly the debate over guns resembles less a contest over crime policy, and more a culture war over core values.<br> <br>Through it all, we see how the great themes of American history rise and recur: the role of government. Race. Freedom. The singular power of the Supreme Court. Most strikingly, the fact that our view of the Second Amendment is set, at each stage, not by a pristine constitutional text, but by the push-and-pull, the rough-and-tumble of political advocacy and public agitation.<br> <br>But first, we should start by understanding why we have a Second Amendment in the first place. That story begins in the heat of revolution, sixteen miles outside Boston.</p><h2>Dean and Me: (A Love Story)</h2><p>They were the unlikeliest of pairs&#x2014;a handsome crooner and a skinny monkey, an Italian from Steubenville, Ohio, and a Jew from Newark, N.J.. Before they teamed up, Dean Martin seemed destined for a mediocre career as a nightclub singer, and Jerry Lewis was dressing up as Carmen Miranda and miming records on stage. But the moment they got together, something clicked&#x2014;something miraculous&#x2014;and audiences saw it at once. <br><br>Before long, they were as big as Elvis or the Beatles would be after them, creating hysteria wherever they went and grabbing an unprecedented hold over every entertainment outlet of the era: radio, television, movies, stage shows, and nightclubs. Martin and Lewis were a national craze, an American institution. The millions (and the women) flowed in, seemingly without end&#x2014;and then, on July 24, 1956, ten years from the day when the two men joined forces, it all ended. <br><br>After that traumatic day, the two wouldn&#x2019;t speak again for twenty years. And while both went on to forge triumphant individual careers&#x2014;Martin as a movie and television star, recording artist, and nightclub luminary (and charter member of the Rat Pack); Lewis as the groundbreaking writer, producer, director, and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies&#x2014;their parting left a hole in the national psyche, as well as in each man&#x2019;s heart.<br><br>In a memoir by turns moving, tragic, and hilarious, Jerry Lewis recounts with crystal clarity every step of a fifty-year friendship, from the springtime, 1945 afternoon when the two vibrant young performers destined to conquer the world together met on Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street, to their tragic final encounter in the 1990s, when Lewis and his wife ran into Dean Martin, a broken and haunted old man.<br><br>In <i>Dean &amp; Me</i>, Jerry Lewis makes a convincing case for Dean Martin as one of the great&#x2014;and most underrated&#x2014;comic talents of our era. But what comes across most powerfully in this definitive memoir is the depth of love Lewis felt, and still feels, for his partner, and which his partner felt for him: truly a love to last for all time.</p><p><p>JERRY LEWIS and Dean Martin sandwiched sixteen money-making films in between nightclub engagements, recording sessions, radio shows, and television bookings during their ten-year partnership. Over the following years Lewis remained in the spotlight as the groundbreaking creator and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies, and scored triumphs in stage appearances in Europe, where he has been hailed as one of the greatest director<b>-</b>comedians of the twentieth century. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and has received numerous other honors for his tireless efforts in the fight against the fourty neuromuscular diseases. <br>JAMES KAPLAN has written novels, essays, and reviews, as well as over a hundred major profiles for many magazines, including<i> The New Yorker, </i>the<i> New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Entertainment Weekly,</i> and <i>New York.</i> In 2002 Kaplan coauthored the autobiography of John McEnroe, <i>You Cannot Be Serious,</i> which was an international bestseller (and #1 on the<i> New York Times</i> list). He lives in Westchester, New York, with his wife and three sons.</p><b>Chapter One</b><br><br>In the age of Truman, Eisenhower, and Joe McCarthy, we freed America. For ten years after World War II, Dean and I were not only the most successful show-business act in history&#x2013;we were history. <br><br>You have to remember: Postwar America was a very buttoned-up nation. Radio shows were run by censors, Presidents wore hats, ladies wore girdles. We came straight out of the blue&#x2013;nobody was expecting anything like Martin and Lewis. A sexy guy and a monkey is how some people saw us, but what we really were, in an age of Freudian self-realization, was the explosion of the show-business id.<br> <br>Like Burns and Allen, Abbott and Costello, and Hope and Crosby, we were vaudevillians, stage performers who worked with an audience. But the difference between us and all the others is significant. They worked with a script. We exploded without one, the same way wiseguy kids do on a playground, or jazz musicians do when they&#x2019;re let loose. And the minute we started out in nightclubs, audiences went nuts for us. As Alan King told an interviewer a few years ago: &#x201c;I have been in the business for fifty-five years, and I have never to this day seen an act get more laughs than Martin and Lewis. They didn&#x2019;t get laughs&#x2013;it was pan�demonium. People knocked over tables.&#x201d; <br><br>Like so many entertainment explosions, we happened almost by accident. <br><br>----------<br><br>It was a crisp March day in midtown Manhattan, March of 1945. I had just turned nineteen, and I was going to live forever. I could feel the bounce in my legs, the air in my lungs. World War II was rapidly draw�ing to a close, and New York was alive with excitement. Broadway was full of city smells&#x2013;bus and taxi exhaust; roast peanuts and dirty-water hot dogs; and, most thrilling of all, the perfumes of beautiful women. Midtown was swarming with gorgeous gals! Secretaries, career girls, society broads with little pooches&#x2013;they all paraded past, tick-tock, tick-tock, setting my heart racing every ten paces. I was a very young newly�wed, with a very pregnant wife back in Newark, but I had eyes, and I looked. And looked. And looked. <br><br>I was strolling south with my pal Sonny King, heading toward an appointment with an agent in Times Square. Sonny was an ex-prize-fighter from Brooklyn trying to make it as a singer, a knock-around guy, street-smart and quick with a joke&#x2013;kind of like an early Tony Danza. He prided himself on his nice tenor voice and on knowing everybody who was anybody in show business. Not that his pride always matched up with reality. But that was Sonny, a bit of an operator. And me? I was a Jersey kid trying to make it as a comic. My act&#x2013;are you ready for this?&#x2013; was as follows: I would get up on stage and make funny faces while I lip-synched along to phonograph records. The professional term for what I did was <i>dumb act</i>, a phrase I didn&#x2019;t want to think about too much. In those days, it felt a little too much like a bad review. <br><br>You know good-bad? Good was that I was young and full of beans and ready to take on the world. Bad was that I had no idea on earth how I was going to accomplish this feat. And bad was also that I was just eking out a living, pulling down $110 a week in a good week, and there weren&#x2019;t that many good weeks. On this princely sum I had to pay my manager, Abner J. Greshler, plus the rent on the Newark apartment, plus feed two, about to be three. Plus wardrobe, candy bars, milk shakes, and phonograph records for the act. Plus my hotel bill. While I was working in New York, I stayed in the city, to be close to my jobs&#x2013;when I had them&#x2013;and to stick to where the action was. I&#x2019;d been rooming at the Bel�mont Plaza, on Lexington and Forty-ninth, where I&#x2019;d also been perform�ing in the Glass Hat, a nightclub in the hotel. I got $135 a week and a room. <br><br>Suddenly, at Broadway and Fifty-fourth, Sonny spotted someone across the street: a tall, dark, and incredibly handsome man in a camel&#x2019;s-hair coat. His name, Sonny said, was Dean Martin. Just looking at him intimidated me: <i>How does anybody get that handsome?</i> <br><br>I smiled at the sight of him in that camel&#x2019;s-hair coat. <i>Harry Horseshit</i>, I thought. That was what we used to call a guy who thought he was smooth with the ladies. Anybody who wore a camel&#x2019;s-hair overcoat, with a camel&#x2019;s-hair belt and fake diamond cuff links, was automatically Harry Horseshit. <br><br>But this guy, I knew, was the real deal. He was standing with a shorter, older fellow, and when he saw Sonny, he waved us over. We crossed the street. I was amazed all over again when I saw how good-looking he was&#x2013;long, rugged face; great profile; thick, dark brows and eyelashes. And a suntan in March! How&#x2019;d he manage that? I could see he had kind of a twinkle as he talked to the older guy. <i>Charisma</i> is a word I would learn later. All I knew then was that I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off Sonny&#x2019;s pal. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Dino!&#x201d; Sonny said as we came up to them. &#x201c;How ya doin&#x2019;, Lou?&#x201d; he said to the older man. <br><br>Lou, it turned out, was Lou Perry, Dean&#x2019;s manager. He looked like a manager: short, thin-lipped, cool-eyed. Sonny introduced me, and Perry glanced at me without much interest. But Sonny looked excited. He turned to his camel-coated friend. &#x201c;Dino,&#x201d; Sonny said, &#x201c;I want you to meet a very funny kid, Jerry Lewis.&#x201d; <br>Camel-Coat smiled warmly and put out his hand. I took it. It was a big hand, strong, but he didn&#x2019;t go overboard with the grip. I liked that. I liked <i>him</i>, instantly. And he looked genuinely glad to meet me. <br><br>&#x201c;Kid,&#x201d; Sonny said&#x2013;Sonny called me Kid the first time he ever met me, and he would still call me Kid in Vegas fifty years later&#x2013;&#x201c;this is Dean Martin. Sings even better than me.&#x201d; <br><br>That was Sonny, fun and games. Of course, he had zero idea that he was introducing me to one of the great comic talents of our time. I cer�tainly had no idea of that, either&#x2013;nor, for that matter, did Dean. At that moment, at the end of World War II, we were just two guys struggling to make it in show business, shaking hands on a busy Broadway street corner. <br><br>We made a little chitchat. &#x201c;You workin&#x2019;?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>He smiled that million-dollar smile. Now that I looked at him close up, I could see the faint outline of a healing surgical cut on the bridge of his nose. Some plastic surgeon had done great work. &#x201c;Oh, this &#x2019;n&#x2019; that, you know,&#x201d; Dean said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on WMCA radio, sustaining. No bucks, just room.&#x201d; He had a mellow, lazy voice, with a slightly Southern lilt to it. He sounded like he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world, like he was knockin&#x2019; &#x2019;em dead wherever he went. I believed it. Little did I know that he was hip-deep in debt to Perry and several other managers besides. <br><br>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout you?&#x201d; Dean asked me. <br><br>I nodded, quickly. I suddenly wanted, very badly, to impress this man. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just now finishing my eighth week at the Glass Hat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;In the Belmont Plaza.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Really? I live there,&#x201d; Dean said. <br><br>&#x201c;At the Glass Hat?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, at the Belmont. It&#x2019;s part of my radio deal.&#x201d; <br><br>Just at that moment, a beautiful brunette walked by, in a coat with a fur-trimmed collar. Dean lowered his eyelids slightly and flashed her that grin&#x2013;and damned if she didn&#x2019;t smile right back! How come I never got that reaction? She gave him a lingering gaze over her shoulder as she passed, a clear invitation, and Dean shook his head, smiling his regrets. <br><br>&#x201c;Look at this guy,&#x201d; Sonny said in his hoarse Brooklyn accent. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got pussy radar!&#x201d; <br><br>One look at Sonny&#x2019;s eyes was enough to tell me that he idolized Dean&#x2013;whose attention, all at once, I felt anxious to get back. &#x201c;You ever go to Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s?&#x201d; I asked, my voice sounding even higher and squeakier than its usual high and squeaky. Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s was a restaurant and nightclub a couple of blocks away, on fabulous Fifty-second Street&#x2013;which, in those days, was lined with restaurants and former speakeasies, like &#x201c;21,&#x201d; and music clubs like the Five Spot and Birdland. Live entertainment still ruled America in those pretelevi�sion days, Manhattan was the world capital of nightclubs, and Leon and Eddie&#x2019;s was a mecca for nightclub comics. Sunday night was Celebrity Night: The fun would start after hours, when anybody in the business might show up and get on to do a piece of their act. You&#x2019;d see the likes of Milton Berle, Henny Youngman, Danny Kaye. It was magical. I used to go and gawk, like a kid in a candy store. <i>Someday</i>, I thought. . . . But for now, no chance. They&#x2019;d never use a dumb act&#x2013;one needing props, yet. <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sometimes I stop by Sunday nights,&#x201d; Dean said. <br><br>&#x201c;Me too!&#x201d; I cried. <br><br>He gave me that smile again&#x2013;warm but ever so slightly cool around the edges. It bathed you in its glow, yet didn&#x2019;t let you in. Men don&#x2019;t like to admit it, but there&#x2019;s something about a truly handsome guy who also happens to be truly masculine&#x2013;what they call a <i>man&#x2019;s man</i>&#x2013;that&#x2019;s as magnetic to us as it is to women. <i>That&#x2019;s what I want to be like</i>, you think. <i>Maybe if I hang around with him, some of that&#x2019;ll rub off on me</i>. <br><br>&#x201c;So&#x2013;maybe I&#x2019;ll see you there sometime,&#x201d; Dean told me. <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;Go get your tux out of hock,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>I laughed. He was funny. <br><br>----------<br><br>Sonny King was a pal, but not a friend. I badly needed a friend. I was a lonely kid, the only child of two vaudevillians who were rarely around. My dad, Danny, was a singer and ...</p><h2>Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power</h2><p>By 1991, following the disintegration first of the Soviet bloc and then of the Soviet Union itself, the United States was left standing tall as the only global super-power. Not only the 20th but even the 21st century seemed destined to be the American centuries. But that super-optimism did not last long. During the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the stock market bubble and the costly foreign unilateralism of the younger Bush presidency, as well as the financial catastrophe of 2008 jolted America &#x2013; and much of the West &#x2013; into a sudden recognition of its systemic vulnerability to unregulated greed. Moreover, the East was demonstrating a surprising capacity for economic growth and technological innovation. That prompted new anxiety about the future, including even about America&#x2019;s status as the leading world power. This book is a response to a challenge. It argues that without an America that is economically vital, socially appealing, responsibly powerful, and capable of sustaining an intelligent foreign engagement, the geopolitical prospects for the West could become increasingly grave. The ongoing changes in the distribution of global power and mounting global strife make it all the more essential that America does not retreat into an ignorant garrison-state mentality or wallow in cultural hedonism but rather becomes more strategically deliberate and historically enlightened in its global engagement with the new East. This book seeks to answer four major questions:<p>1. What are the implications of the changing distribution of global power from West to East, and how is it being affected by the new reality of a politically awakened humanity?<b><br></b><b></b>2. Why is America&#x2019;s global appeal waning, how ominous are the symptoms of America&#x2019;s domestic and international decline, and how did America waste the unique global opportunity offered by the peaceful end of the Cold War?<br> 3. What would be the likely geopolitical consequences if America did decline by 2025, and could China then assume America&#x2019;s central role in world affairs?<br> 4. What ought to be a resurgent America&#x2019;s major long-term geopolitical goals in order to shape a more vital and larger West and to engage cooperatively the emerging and dynamic new East?</p><p><b></b>America, Brzezinski argues, must define and pursue a comprehensive and long-term a geopolitical vision, a vision that is responsive to the challenges of the changing historical context. This book seeks to provide the strategic blueprint for that vision.</p></p><p><b>Zbigniew Brzezinski</b>, formerly President Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor, is a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor of American foreign policy at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

The Aghori whom this book is about must have been a great soul indeed, and wise enough to have this book published after his death considering the questionable nature of spiritualists in today's society. --By SG on 13 March 2016<br><br>I had no idea about Aghora or Aghori, but i have seen some crazy naked sadhu''s in documentary of 'Kumbh Mela' a mass Hindu pilgrimage in which Hindus gather to bathe in a sacred river Ganga. I was wondering why they are naked, what kind of rituals they do and there was no answers even after reading top or best selling spiritual books! But as i completed this book, everything was very clear to me. --By Ganesh on 22 June 2016<br><br>This book contains aghora wisdoms and left hand tantra. It's a great read. However it may seem disturbing to some because of uncommon and extreme aghora rituals. But Vimalananda has beautifully explained the relevance of each ritual with red flags of caution for curious aspirants at appropriate places. --By varun on 25 April 2014</p><h2>Advanced Bridge Bidding for the 21st Century</h2><p>Max Hardy follows his first volume, Standard Bridge Bidding for the 21st Century, with his comprehensive second volume, including contributions by expert players Grant Baze, Marty Bergen, Fred Hamilton, Jeff Meckstroth, Mike Passell, and Eddie Wold.</p><p>Max Hardy is one of the most versatile professionals in the world of bridge.

In this case the "moment" she recreates is a day at the royal court of Versailles. Pictures of Louis XIV and his court are framed by a narrow gold border; many of the illustrations have inscriptions underneath in the manner of 17th-century engravings. The text, in bolder print, adds facts and explanations to the descriptive pictures. Color is the most striking element in Aliki's drawings. The richness of the king's costumes, his wigs, lace, red stockings, and high- heeled shoes are echoed by the attire of his courtiers. The pictures vary in size and placement, leading readers' eyes through the events of the king's day, from the royal rising ritual to the final ceremonial "coucher" or going-to-bed. The spectacular size of the palace of Versailles and the crowded events of court life, all centering on the elaborately costumed figure of Louis XIV, capture the spirit of absolute monarchy in a form that will surely appeal to curious children in this age of democracy and the common man. The book contains a brief chronology and a list of French words, but with no guide to pronunciation. Never mind--it is the pictures that tell the story. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Life at the court of Versailles boggles the mind: Louis XIV had, among other things, a garden containing four million tulips, and an everyday supper consisted of some 40 dishes! Tidbits like this abound in Aliki's new book, in which she chronicles a day in the life of this 17th-century monarch. Her thorough research never overwhelms the seamless telling, although some details won't suit every reader: an entire page is devoted to the monarch's mistresses and the many offspring they bore him. Some of the pages seem crowded; perhaps a more generous design, allowing for more white space, would have been more effective. Nevertheless, the book presents an intriguing glimpse of the splendor and extravagance of the Sun King's court.

The first few inches happened automatically. But soon I&#x2019;d notice that the higher I got, the more my progress depended on me&#x2014;on what <i>I</i> did. If I got too excited, too swept away by the experience, I would plummet back to the ground . . . hard. But if I played it cool, took it all in stride, then off I would go, faster and faster, up into the starry sky.<br> <br>Maybe those dreams were part of the reason why, as I got older, I fell in love with airplanes and rockets&#x2014;with anything that might get me back up there in the world above this one. When our family flew, my face was pressed flat to the plane&#x2019;s window from takeoff to landing. In the summer of 1968, when I was fourteen, I spent all the money I&#x2019;d earned mowing lawns on a set of sailplane lessons with a guy named Gus Street at Strawberry Hill, a little grass strip &#x201c;airport&#x201d; just west of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the town where I grew up. I still remember the feeling of my heart pounding as I pulled the big cherry-red knob that unhooked the rope connecting me to the towplane and banked my sailplane toward the field. It was the first time I had ever felt truly alone and free. Most of my friends got that feeling in cars, but for my money being a thousand feet up in a sailplane beat that thrill a hundred times over.<br> <br>In college in the 1970s I joined the University of North Carolina sport parachuting (or skydiving) team. It felt like a secret brotherhood&#x2014;a group of people who knew about something special and magical. My first jump was terrifying, and the second even more so. But by my twelfth jump, when I stepped out the door and had to fall for more than a thousand feet before opening my parachute (my first &#x201c;ten second delay&#x201d;), I knew I was home. I made 365 parachute jumps in college and logged more than three and a half hours in free fall, mainly in formations with up to twenty-five fellow jumpers. Although I stopped jumping in 1976, I continued to enjoy vivid dreams about skydiving, which were always pleasant.<br> <br>The best jumps were often late in the afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink beneath the horizon. It&#x2019;s hard to describe the feeling I would get on those jumps: a feeling of getting close to something that I could never quite name but that I knew I had to have more of. It wasn&#x2019;t solitude exactly, because the way we dived actually wasn&#x2019;t all that solitary. We&#x2019;d jump five, six, sometimes ten or twelve people at a time, building free-fall formations. The bigger and the more challenging, the better.<br> <br>One beautiful autumn Saturday in 1975, the rest of the UNC jumpers and I teamed up with some of our friends at a paracenter in eastern North Carolina for some formations. On our penultimate jump of the day, out of a D18 Beechcraft at 10,500 feet, we made a ten-man snowflake. We managed to get ourselves into complete formation before we passed 7,000 feet, and thus were able to enjoy a full eighteen seconds of flying the formation down a clear chasm between two towering cumulus clouds before breaking apart at 3,500 feet and tracking away from each other to open our chutes.<br> <br>By the time we hit the ground, the sun was down. But by hustling into another plane and taking off again quickly, we managed to get back up into the last of the sun&#x2019;s rays and do a second sunset jump. For this one, two junior members were getting their first shot at flying into formation&#x2014;that is, joining it from the outside rather than being the base or pin man (which is easier because your job is essentially to fall straight down while everyone else maneuvers toward you). It was exciting for the two junior members, but also for those of us who were more seasoned, because we were building the team, adding to the experience of jumpers who&#x2019;d later be capable of joining us for even bigger formations.<br> <br>I was to be the last man out in a six-man star attempt above the runways of the small airport just outside Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. The guy directly in front of me was named Chuck. Chuck was fairly experienced at &#x201c;relative work,&#x201d; or RW&#x2014;that is, building free-fall formations. We were still in sunshine at 7,500 feet, but a mile and a half below us the streetlights were blinking on. Twilight jumps were always sublime and this was clearly going to be a beautiful one.<br> <br>Even though I&#x2019;d be exiting the plane a mere second or so behind Chuck, I&#x2019;d have to move fast to catch up with everyone. I&#x2019;d rocket straight down headfirst for the first seven seconds or so. This would make me drop almost 100 miles per hour faster than my friends so that I could be right there with them after they had built the initial formation.<br> <br>Normal procedure for RW jumps was for all jumpers to break apart at 3,500 feet and track away from the formation for maximum separation. Each would then &#x201c;wave off&#x201d; with his arms (signaling imminent deployment of his parachute), turn to look above to make sure no others were above him, then pull the rip cord.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three, two, one . . . go!&#x201d;<br> <br>The first four jumpers exited, then Chuck and I followed close behind. Upside down in a full-head dive and approaching terminal velocity, I smiled as I saw the sun setting for the second time that day. After streaking down to the others, my plan was to slam on the air brakes by throwing out my arms (we had fabric wings from wrists to hips that gave tremendous resistance when fully inflated at high speed) and aiming my jumpsuit&#x2019;s bell-bottomed sleeves and pant legs straight into the oncoming air.<br> <br>But I never had the chance.<br> <br>Plummeting toward the formation, I saw that one of the new guys had come in too fast. Maybe falling rapidly between nearby clouds had him a little spooked&#x2014;it reminded him that he was moving about two hundred feet per second toward that giant planet below, partially shrouded in the gathering darkness. Rather than slowly joining the edge of the formation, he&#x2019;d barreled in and knocked everybody loose. Now all five other jumpers were tumbling out of control.<br> <br>They were also much too close together. A skydiver leaves a super-turbulent stream of low-pressure air behind him. If a jumper gets into that trail, he instantly speeds up and can crash into the person below him. That, in turn, can make both jumpers accelerate and slam into anyone who might be below <i>them</i>. In short, it&#x2019;s a recipe for disaster.<br> <br>I angled my body and tracked away from the group to avoid the tumbling mess. I maneuvered until I was falling right over &#x201c;the spot,&#x201d; a magical point on the ground above which we were to open our parachutes for the leisurely two-minute descent.<br> <br>I looked over and was relieved to see that the disoriented jumpers were now also tracking away from each other, dispersing the deadly clump.<br> <br>Chuck was there among them. To my surprise, he was coming straight in my direction. He stopped directly beneath me. With all of the group&#x2019;s tumbling, we were passing through 2,000 feet elevation more quickly than Chuck had anticipated. Maybe he thought he was lucky and didn&#x2019;t have to follow the rules&#x2014;exactly.<br> <br><i>He must not see me</i>. The thought barely had time to go through my head before Chuck&#x2019;s colorful pilot chute blossomed out of his backpack. His pilot chute caught the 120-mph breeze coming around him and shot straight toward me, pulling his main parachute in its sleeve right behind it.<br> <br>From the instant I saw Chuck&#x2019;s pilot chute emerge, I had a fraction of a second to react. For it would take less than a second to tumble through his deploying main parachute, and&#x2014;quite likely&#x2014;right into Chuck himself. At that speed, if I hit his arm or his leg I would take it right off, dealing myself a fatal blow in the process. If I hit him directly, both our bodies would essentially explode.<br> <br>People say things move more slowly in situations like this, and they&#x2019;re right. My mind watched the action in the microseconds that followed as if it were watching a movie in slow motion.<br> <br>The instant I saw the pilot chute, my arms flew to my sides and I straightened my body into a head dive, bending ever so slightly at the hips. The verticality gave me increased speed, and the bend allowed my body to add first a little, then a blast of horizontal motion as my body became an efficient wing, sending me zipping past Chuck just in front of his colorful blossoming Para-Commander parachute.<br> <br>I passed him going at over 150 miles per hour, or 220 feet per second. Given that speed, I doubt he saw the expression on my face. But if he had, he would have seen a look of sheer astonishment. Somehow I had reacted in microseconds to a situation that, had I actually had time to think about it, would have been much too complex for me to deal with.<br> <br>And yet . . . I <i>had</i> dealt with it, and we both landed safely. It was as if, presented with a situation that required more than its usual ability to respond, my brain had become, for a moment, superpowered.<br> <br>How had I done it? Over the course of my twenty-plus-year career in academic neurosurgery&#x2014;of studying the brain, observing how it works, and operating on it&#x2014;I have had plenty of opportunities to ponder this very question. I finally chalked it up to the fact that the brain is truly an extraordinary device: more extraordinary than we can even guess.<br> <br>I realize now that the real answer to that question is much more profound. But I had to go through a complete metamorphosis of my life and worldview to glimpse that answer. This book is about the events that changed my mind on the matter. They convinced me that, as marvelous a mechanism as the brain is, it was not my brain that saved my life that day at all. What sprang into action the second Chuck&#x2019;s chute started to open was another, much deeper part of me. A part that could move so fast because it was not stuck in time at all, the way the brain and body are.<br> <br>This was the same part of me, in fact, that had made me so homesick for the skies as a kid. It&#x2019;s not only the smartest part of us, but the deepest part as well, yet for most of my adult life I was unable to believe in it.<br> <br>But I do believe now, and the pages that follow will tell you why.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a neurosurgeon.<br> <br>I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976 with a major in chemistry and earned my M.D. at Duke University Medical School in 1980. During my eleven years of medical school and residency training at Duke as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, I focused on neuroendocrinology, the study of the interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine system&#x2014;the series of glands that release the hormones that direct most of your body&#x2019;s activities. I also spent two of those eleven years investigating how blood vessels in one area of the brain react pathologically when there is bleeding into it from an aneurysm&#x2014;a syndrome known as cerebral vasospasm.<br> <br>After completing a fellowship in cerebrovascular neurosurgery in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom, I spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an associate professor of surgery, with a specialization in neurosurgery. During those years I operated on countless patients, many of them with severe, life-threatening brain conditions.<br> <br>Most of my research work involved the development of advanced technical procedures like stereotactic radiosurgery, a technique that allows surgeons to precisely guide beams of radiation to specific targets deep in the brain without affecting adjacent areas. I also helped develop magnetic resonance image&#x2013;guided neurosurgical procedures instrumental in repairing hard-to-treat brain conditions like tumors and vascular disorders. During those years I also authored or coauthored more than 150 chapters and papers for peer-reviewed medical journals and presented my findings at more than two hundred medical conferences around the world.<br> <br>In short, I devoted myself to science. Using the tools of modern medicine to help and to heal people, and to learn more about the workings of the human body and brain, was my life&#x2019;s calling. I felt immeasurably lucky to have found it. More important, I had a beautiful wife and two lovely children, and while I was in many ways married to my work, I did not neglect my family, which I considered the other great blessing in my life. On many counts I was a very lucky man, and I knew it.<br> <br>On November 10, 2008, however, at age fifty-four, my luck seemed to run out. I was struck by a rare illness and thrown into a coma for seven days. During that time, my entire neocortex&#x2014;the outer surface of the brain, the part that makes us human&#x2014;was shut down. Inoperative. In essence, absent.<br> <br>When your brain is absent, you are absent, too. As a neurosurgeon, I&#x2019;d heard many stories over the years of people who had strange experiences, usually after suffering cardiac arrest: stories of traveling to mysterious, wonderful landscapes; of talking to dead relatives&#x2014;even of meeting God Himself.<br> <br>Wonderful stuff, no question. But all of it, in my opinion, was pure fantasy. What caused the otherworldly types of experiences that such people so often report? I didn&#x2019;t claim to know, but I did know that they were brain-based. All of consciousness is. If you don&#x2019;t have a working brain, you can&#x2019;t be conscious.<br> <br>This is because the brain is the machine that produces consciousness in the first place. When the machine breaks down, consciousness stops. As vastly complicated and mysterious as the actual mechanics of brain processes are, in essence the matter is as simple as that. Pull the plug and the TV goes dead. The show is over, no matter how much you might have been enjoying it.<br> <br>Or so I would have told you before my own brain crashed.<br> <br>During my coma my brain wasn&#x2019;t working improperly&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t working <i>at all</i>. I now believe that this might have been what was responsible for the depth and intensity of the near-death experience (NDE) that I myself underwent during it. Many of the NDEs reported happen when a person&#x2019;s heart has shut down for a while. In those cases, the neocortex is temporarily inactivated, but generally not too damaged, provided that the flow of oxygenated blood is restored through cardiopulmonary resuscitation or reactivation of cardiac function within four minutes or so. But in my case, the neocortex was out of the picture. I was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed <i>completely free of the limitations of my physical brain</i>.<br> <br>Mine was in some ways a perfect storm of near-death experiences. As a practicing neurosurgeon with decades of research and hands-on work in the operating room behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the <i>implications</i> of what happened to me.<br> <br>Those implications are tremendous beyond description. My experience showed me that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave. More important, it continues under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us and about where the universe itself and all the beings within it are ultimately going.<br> <br>The place I went was real. Real in a way that makes the life we&#x2019;re living here and now completely dreamlike by comparison. This doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t value the life I&#x2019;m living now, however. In fact, I value it more than I ever did before.

Joy Williams does more than watch. In this collection of condemnations and love letters, revelations and cries for help, she brings to light the price of complacency with scathing wit and unexpected humor. Sounding the alarm over the disconnection from the natural world that our consumer culture has created, she takes on subjects as varied as the culling of elephants, electron-probed chimpanzees, vanishing wetlands, and the determination of American women to reproduce at any cost. Controversial, opinionated, at times exceptionally moving, <b>Ill Nature</b> is a clarion call for us to step out of our cars and cubicles, and do something to save our natural legacy.</p><p>Best known as a novelist, but also an accomplished journalist, Joy Williams has a great gift for inducing guilt trips. No one is safe: in the opening pages of <i>Ill Nature</i>, she implicates every First Worlder in creation for causing the death of the natural world, the victim of our material urges. She writes that the thousands of new digital television towers being erected today, for example, are responsible for the deaths of millions of songbirds that unwittingly slam into them or their guylines in midflight; by extension, anyone who owns a digital TV set is partly to blame for this unforeseen episode in the larger ecological crisis, no matter how well-intentioned those viewers may be.<p> Turning a sharp eye on ecotourists, zoogoers, hunters, politicians, developers, expectant mothers, carnivores, conservatives, liberals, and just about anyone else who crosses her path, Williams decries the rapid loss of the wild, which in her eyes is no mere abstraction.

Parker&#39;s Old Black Magic (Spenser)</h2><p><b>Iconic, tough-but-tender Boston PI Spenser delves into the black market art scene to investigate a decades-long unsolved crime of dangerous proportions.</b><br><br>The heist was legendary, still talked about twenty years after the priceless paintings disappeared from one of Boston's premier art museums. Most thought the art was lost forever, buried deep, sold off overseas, or, worse, destroyed as incriminating evidence. But when paint chips from the most valuable piece stolen, <i>Gentlemen in Black</i> by a Spanish master, arrives at the desk of a Boston journalist, the museum finds hope and enlists Spenser's help. <br><br>Soon the cold art case thrusts Spenser into the shady world of black market art dealers, aged Mafia bosses, and old vendettas. A five-million-dollar-reward by the museum's top benefactor, an aged, unlikable Boston socialite, sets Spenser and pals Vinnie Morris and Hawk onto a trail of hidden secrets, jailhouse confessions, and decades-old murders. <br><br>Set against the high-society art scene and the low-life back alleys of Boston, this is classic Spenser doing what he does best.</p><p><b>Robert B. Parker</b> was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, the novels featuring police chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole-Everett Hitch westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, he died in January 2010.<br> <br><b>Ace Atkins</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Quinn Colson novels, two of which were nominated for the Edgar Award for Best Novel.

He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.1<br><br>i'm dying, spenser," the man said.<br><br>I nodded, not knowing what else to say. An early-summer rain beaded down my office window, dark gray skies hovering over Berkeley and Boylston as afternoon commuters jockeyed for position out of the city. Their taillights cast a red glow on slick streets. Somewhere a prowl car hit a siren, heading off to another crime. The man sitting before me smiled and nodded, his hands withered and liver-spotted. His name was Locke.<br><br>"How long have we known each other?" Locke said.<br><br>"A long time."<br><br>"But oddly never worked together?"<br><br>"Our work as investigators seldom crossed paths," I said. "Different peepholes."<br><br>"Recovering stolen art isn't really your thing."<br><br>"I've done it," I said. "Once. Or twice."<br><br>"You're familiar with the theft at the Winthrop?"<br><br>"Of course," I said. "It made all the papers. And TV. Biggest theft in Boston history."<br><br>"Biggest art theft ever," he said. "Next year will mark twenty years. I've chased those paintings most of that time, traveling from Dorchester to Denmark with not so much as an inkling of where they ended up. It's beyond frustrating. Maddening, really. And now, well, with things the way they are-"<br><br>"One was a Picasso?"<br><br>"That was the least valuable of the three," he said. "Picasso, Goya. But the prize of the Winthrop was also stolen, the El Greco. The Gentleman in Black. Are you familiar with the painting?"<br><br>"Some," I said. "I recall seeing it years ago. When I was young."<br><br>"When we were both young," Locke said.<br><br>He smiled and reached into his double-breasted suit jacket and pulled out a slick photocopy of a very serious-looking dude with a pointy black beard. The man wore a high-necked lacy shirt and a heavy black cloak. His eyes were very black and humorless.<br><br>"He looks like a guy who used to kick field goals for the Detroit Lions," I said. "Benny Ricardo."<br><br>"The subject is reputed to be Juan de Silva y Ribera, third marquis of Montemayor and the warden of the Alc&#x2021;zar of Toledo."<br><br>"Oh," I said. "Him."<br><br>"El Greco painted him in 1597," he said. "Well before the Pilgrims set foot in America. Long regarded as unimportant by the romantics, El Greco found new appreciation and fame among the impressionists and surrealists. Picasso in particular was a great admirer of El Greco. You see the distorted length of the man's neck, the off-kilter perspective?"<br><br>"Some have noted my own perspective is off-kilter," I said. "Although I admit to having more of an affinity for the Dutch Masters."<br><br>"I spotted your Vermeer prints when I walked in," he said. "You also have many fans at the Hammond. You helped recover, what was it? Lady with a Finch."<br><br>I nodded and offered him something to drink. It was that time of the day when I could bend to either whiskey or coffee. Locke, being a man of the arts, approved of the whiskey. I pulled out a bottle of Bushmills Black gifted to me by Martin Quirk and found two clean coffee mugs left to dry upside down beside the sink.<br><br>"Without being trite, that painting you recovered from the Hammond is nothing but a Rembrandt footnote," he said. "This work is something altogether different. A cornerstone of Spanish and art history."<br><br>"How much?"<br><br>"One can't always put a price on the priceless," he said. "But somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty or seventy million."<br><br>Like any serious art connoisseur, I gave a low whistle.<br><br>"I wanted to recover the piece myself," he said. "But now? I have to understand the realities of my situation."<br><br>"I'm very sorry."<br><br>"And I'm sorry to march into your office with such maudlin conversation," Locke said. "But my doctor told me to get my affairs in order, whatever the hell that means. I figured this was the first order, have someone to pass along my files, endless notes, and potential leads. I grew too old for this case two years ago. The Winthrop continues to push, with the anniversary coming up next week and these letters arriving every other week."<br><br>"Letters?"<br><br>"Yes," Locke said, sipping the whiskey. "Not really ransom notes. But from someone who claims to have knowledge of the theft."<br><br>"Do you think they're real?"<br><br>"Perhaps," Locke said. "The letters were very specific about details of the theft. The writer was also aware of an arcane detail of the painting. El Greco himself had written on the back of the canvas in his native Greek."<br><br>"Have they asked for money?"<br><br>"No," Locke said. "No demands have been made. And no means of communication has been offered. The letters have been addressed to the museum's director, Marjorie Ward Phillips. Have you and Susan ever met Marjorie at a fund-raiser?"<br><br>I shook my head and picked up the coffee mug. The mug advertised Kane's Donuts in Saugus, a place I considered to have made many fine works of art.<br><br>"Marjorie is a determined, if altogether unpleasant, person," Locke said. "Her staff calls her Large Marj."<br><br>"A big personality?"<br><br>"How do I put this?" he said. "She has an ass the size of a steer and the disposition of a recently castrated bull."<br><br>"Lovely," I said. "Can't wait to meet her."<br><br>"Oh, she'll charm you," Locke said, chuckling. "At first. There will be martinis and long talks of art's value to the city of Boston. But don't ever disagree with her. Or challenge her in front of the board. Once that's done, you will be visited by the hatred of a thousand suns."<br><br>"If you're trying to talk me into this," I said. "You're failing miserably."<br><br>"You must take this case, Spenser," Locke said. "You must. If not, they've threatened to offer the contract to this British investigator. A young man from London who, recent successes aside, has all the earmarks of a four-flusher."<br><br>"At the moment, I'm working two separate cases," I said.<br><br>"Did I mention the five-million-dollar reward, plus covering your daily rate and all expenses?"<br><br>I smiled and turned over my hands, offering my palms. "Perhaps I could find time to meet with Large Marj."<br><br>"I know you're joking," he said. "But for God's sake, don't let her ever hear you say that."<br><br>"Hatred of a thousand suns?"<br><br>"And then some."<br><br>Locke smiled, straightening in his chair, and buttoned the top button of his jacket. Both eyes stared at me, one slightly off and one roaming my face with deep sadness and intelligence. His face sagged, his blue eyes drained of much color and life.<br><br>"It might be months," he said. "But probably weeks. I have a driver. He's waiting for me downstairs now."<br><br>"May I help you out?"<br><br>"First," he said. "Will you accept an old man's dying wish?"<br><br>"Damn, Locke," I said. "You do go for a hard sell."<br><br>"I don't have time to mince words," he said. "I really think they're onto something now. And the last thing the museum needs is an amateur, unfamiliar to Boston, skulking about. This other detective is of the worst sort. He's trying to charm the board into letting him take the case. But they need someone who understands thuggery and violence well beyond red-velvet walls."<br><br>"I should add that to my business card."<br><br>Locke laughed and reached for the Irish whiskey. He drained it quickly and replaced the mug on my desk.<br><br>"Why did you stay on this long if you felt like it was hopeless?"<br><br>Locke smiled. "There's something almost mystical about this painting," he said. "Believe me, you'll see. Maybe a way of touching the past. We are all just passing through this world. We'll be gone soon enough. But this painting has remained for more than five hundred years. Perhaps recovering it would have been my shot at immortality?"<br><br>I nodded. I refilled our glasses.<br><br>"To immortality."<br><br>We sat and drank the rest of the whiskey in silence. After a bit, he stood, shook my hand, and without a word walked out the door.<br><br>2<br><br>large marj?" susan said.<br><br>"Do you know her?"<br><br>"I've met Marjorie Ward Phillips from the Winthrop," she said. "But I've never heard her called that horrible name."<br><br>Susan and I stood at my kitchen island in my Navy Yard condo as I stirred a fork in my cast-iron skillet simmering with kale, onions, and hickory-smoked bacon. The sprawling brick building had once been a dockside warehouse with big picture windows looking onto the harbor and across to Boston. Pearl snuggled in a ball on the couch as the rain continued in the night. Every few minutes, she'd lift her head and sniff for the bacon scent.<br><br>"I understand the nickname is only whispered by museum staff."<br><br>"I don't know her all that well," Susan said. "We've met socially. She gives to both Community Servings and Jumpstart. As far as I know, she is both well-liked and respected in the art scene. She seems like a perfectly lovely woman."<br><br>"Tomorrow morning, I meet with her and the head of the museum board," I said. "A man named Topper."<br><br>"Oh, no."<br><br>"Yeah," I said. "It's going to be hard not to ask."<br><br>"If he's being haunted by the ghosts of Cary Grant and Constance Bennett?"<br><br>I saluted her with my Sam Adams.<br><br>"What could possibly go wrong?"<br><br>"Hard to turn down Locke."<br><br>"How bad?"<br><br>"The worst," I said. "He said it could be weeks. Months at best."<br><br>"God."<br><br>I added a bit of sea salt and cracked pepper to the pan. As I worked, Susan walked over to my record player and slipped on a Sarah Vaughan album. In a Dutch oven, I'd already cooked two organic chicken breasts with heirloom tomatoes to serve over white beans. The beans came from a can. Everything else from the Boston Public Market. Living on the east end of town had widened my choices in the city. Besides a few small markets in Beacon Hill, I didn't have many options on Marlborough Street. Less still after my apartment was destroyed by an arsonist.<br><br>I turned off the heat and pulled out two china plates from under the kitchen station. The chicken had cooled a bit, and I placed a breast on each plate along with the cherry tomatoes and white beans. A little sprig of rosemary on top.<br><br>"Fancy," Susan said.<br><br>"Black-skillet cooking," I said. "Getting back to my Wyoming roots."<br><br>"Yee-haw," Susan said.<br><br>"Gorgeous Jewish women don't say 'yee-haw.'"<br><br>"What do they say?"<br><br>"Oy, vey?"<br><br>Susan tossed a kitchen towel at me. I ducked.<br><br>I set both plates on the table, lit a small candle, and dimmed the lights overhead. Sarah sang about a flower crying for the dew. Susan guarded our food from Pearl while I retrieved another beer and popped the top. When I returned, she was staring out the window at the marina and Boston, the Custom House Tower shining gold and proud from across the harbor.<br><br>"I like it."<br><br>"The chicken?"<br><br>"The view," she said. "The move took some adjustment. But I like the space. Everything seems so wide open and uncluttered. The city almost looks peaceful from here."<br><br>"The drive to Cambridge is about the same," I said. "Maybe better in traffic."<br><br>"You were welcome to stay," she said. "We could have made it work."<br><br>"Why mess with success?" I said. I drank a little beer.<br><br>Susan smiled. We ate for a bit, listening to Sarah and the rain. The lamps positioned around the open space of the condo blossomed with soft gold light. Rain sluiced down the windows, pricks of blue and yellow lights from atop moored ships.<br><br>"Why do you think Locke came to you?"<br><br>"Besides me being tough, resourceful, and smart as a border collie?"<br><br>"Yes," Susan said. "Besides that."<br><br>"He said he was concerned the museum might bring someone from outside Boston," I said. "He told me he's more sure than ever that whoever stole those paintings has roots here."<br><br>Susan nodded. She forked a bit of chicken with some kale. Her face blossomed with a smile as she lifted a glass to her lips. "And what made you accept?"<br><br>"I haven't accepted yet."<br><br>"Oh, you will."<br><br>I shook my head. I tried the chicken, thinking that perhaps the kale would have worked a little better with some lemon. When in doubt, always add a little lemon.<br><br>"How could you pass up working on the mystery of all mysteries?" Susan said.<br><br>"There's a five-million-dollar reward."<br><br>"Probably for those in possession of the paintings," she said. "Not the Winthrop's hired hand."<br><br>"A shamus can dream."<br><br>Susan nodded. I slipped some bacon pieces under the table for Pearl. They disappeared within seconds. I raised my hand aboveboard to a disapproving look from Susan.<br><br>"And for my next miracle," I said.<br><br>"Do you think you can restrain yourself?"<br><br>"From feeding Pearl?"<br><br>"From smarting off to Topper Whosis, a board surely made of crotchety old flakes, and Large Marj long enough to get those paintings back."<br><br>"As I know little to nothing about what I'm stepping into," I said, "I'll have to get back to you on that."<br><br>"Just who do you know in the art world?"<br><br>"I know a guy at South Station who sells prints of dogs playing poker," I said.<br><br>"What about Gino Fish?"<br><br>"A man of fine taste," I said. "But in case you haven't heard, he's dead."<br><br>"I know," she said. "But this painting disappeared twenty years ago. Right? Wasn't Vinnie working with him back then?"<br><br>"Indeed he was."<br><br>"Well."<br><br>"Vinnie and I haven't been on the best of terms as of late."<br><br>"Can't you just hug it out," she said. "Or whatever you mascopaths do."<br><br>"Mascopaths?"<br><br>"It's my own term for serially overly macho psyches. Overly masculine personalities."<br><br>"Would you like me to perform one-armed push-ups before dessert?"<br><br>Susan tapped at her cheek. "While you perform, may I use your back as an ottoman?"<br><br>I thought about it for a moment and then dropped to my knees. "I wouldn't have it any other way."<br><br>3<br><br>the winthrop museum looked like a big wedge of Spanish wedding cake, lots of tan stucco with a barrel-tile roof and windows protected with intricate wrought-iron cages. A woman named Constance Winthrop had the place built sometime in the early part of the last century. She had so much money, she proclaimed she wanted the Alhambra brought to the Fens. Nearly a hundred years later, I walked up the marble steps before opening hours. A guard led me through an indoor courtyard with a bubbling fountain and lots of statuary. I felt a bit like Ferdinand the Bull being ushered into the ring.<br><br>Marjorie Phillips introduced herself from the head of a long oval table. Even though she didn't stand, I could tell she was a sturdy woman. She had a thick, jowly face and a Buster Brown haircut. A reddish and green silk scarf wrapped what I imagined to be a neck thicker than an NFL linebacker's.</p><h2>Addy Saves The Day (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>After the Civil War ends, many families like Addy&#39;s are searching for their loved ones. This summer, Addy&#39;s church is putting on a fund-raising fair to help people hurt by the war. When Addy has to work at the fair with snobby Harriet, their feud heats up again--until tragedy forces the girls to soften their hearts. The fair is a great success. Then, suddenly, the girls discover that the money they&#39;ve raised has been stolen. Addy saves the day, which ends with a wonderful surprise.</p><p>Grade 3-5-The story of Addy and her family, who have escaped from slavery, continues in these two stories set in Philadelphia just before and after the end of the Civil War. Happy Birthday, Addy opens with the protagonist leading a more stable life with her father now delivering ice and searching for a carpenter's position and her mother taking in laundry. Although both parents are being paid as free citizens, the realities of prejudice are clearly evident as Addy laments, "all the colored people got a strange kind of freedom here...There are jobs we can't get and shops we can't eat at just because of the color of our skin." Despite this, she learns the value of optimism from wise, old, blind M'Dear. Addy Saves the Day includes the excitement of a church fair sponsored for postwar family assistance and Abby helping to catch the thief who steals the raised monies. Both books have a good balance of emotion, historical facts, and suspense to keep readers interested; they are attractively illustrated with colorful vignettes and full-page paintings. An addendum, "A Peek Into the Past," provides a good explanation of the time period and its customs, conventions, and realities.

Darryl had gotten me a jumbo-sized antique mixing bowl last Christmas that probably could have held the water supply for an elephant for a day. I don't know where he found it.<br><br> If I ever filled the bowl entirely, I'd have to have one of the werewolves move it. It ate the eighteen cups of flour I dumped into it with room for more. All the while, piratical howls rose up the stairway from the bowels of the basement.<br><br> "Jesse-" Aiden began, raising his voice to carry over an enthusiastic if off-key whistling rendition of "The Sailor's Hornpipe."<br><br> "Call me Barbary Belle," my stepdaughter, Jesse, reminded him.<br><br> Aiden might have looked and sounded like he was a boy, but he hadn't been young for a very long time. We had assimilated him, rather than adopted him, as he was centuries older than Adam and me put together. He was still finding some things about modern life difficult to adjust to, like the live-action-role-playing (LARP) aspect of the computer-based pirate game they were playing.<br><br> "It only works right if you think of me as a pirate and not your sister," Jesse said patiently. Ignoring his response that she wasn't his sister, she continued, "As long as you call me Jesse-that's who you think of when you interact with me. You have to believe I'm a pirate to make it a proper game. The first step is to call me by my game name-Barbary Belle."<br><br> There was a pause as someone let out a full-throated roar that subsided into a groan of frustration.<br><br> "Eat clamshells, you sodding buffoon," Ben chortled. His game name was Sodding Bart, but I didn't have to think of him that way because I was dead, anyway.<br><br> I got out my smaller mixing bowl, the one that had been perfectly adequate until I married into a werewolf pack. I filled it with softened butter, brown sugar, and vanilla. As I mixed them together, I decided that it wasn't that I was a bad pirate, it was that I had miscalculated. By baking sugar-and-chocolate-laden food whenever I died first, I'd succeeded in turning myself into a target.<br><br> The oven beeped to tell me it was at temperature, and I found all four cookie sheets in the narrow cabinet that they belonged in-a minor miracle. I wasn't the only one who got KP duty in the house, but I seemed to be the only one who could put things in the same place (where they belonged) on a regular basis. The baking pans, in particular, got shoved all sorts of odd places. I had once found one of them in the downstairs bathroom. I didn't ask-but I washed that motherhumper with bleach before I used it to bake on again.<br><br> "Motherhumper" was a word that was catching on in the pack with horrible efficiency after "Sodding Bart" Ben had started using it in his pirate role. I wasn't quite sure whether it was a real swearword that no one had thought up yet, one of those swearwords that were real swearwords in Ben's home country of Great Britain (like "fanny," which meant something very different in the UK than it did here), or a replacement swearword like "darn" or "shoot." In any case, I'd found myself using it on occasions when "dang" wasn't quite strong enough-like finding cookware in bathrooms.<br><br> I thought I was good to go when I found the baking pans. But when I opened the cupboard where there should have been ten bags of chocolate chips, there were only six. I searched the kitchen and came up with another one (open and half-gone) in the top cupboard behind the spaghetti noodles, which made six and a half, leaner than I liked for a double-quadruple batch, but it would do.<br><br> What would not do was no eggs. And there were no eggs.<br><br> I scrounged through the fridge for the second time, checking out the back corners and behind the milk, where things liked to hide. But even though I'd gotten four dozen eggs two days ago, there was not an egg to be had.<br><br> There were perils in living in the de facto clubhouse of a werewolf pack. Thawing roasts in the fridge required the concealment skills of a WWII French Underground spy working in Nazi headquarters. I hadn't hidden the eggs because, since they were neither sweet nor bleeding, I'd thought they were safe. I'd been wrong.<br><br> The majority of the egg-and-roast-stealing werewolf pack was currently downstairs, enthralled in games of piracy on the high seas of the computer screen. There was irony in how much they loved the pirate computer game-werewolves are too dense to swim. Coyotes, even coyote shifters like me, can swim just fine-except, apparently, in The Dread Pirate's Booty scenarios, because I'd drowned four times this month.<br><br> I hadn't drowned this time, though. This time, I'd died with my stepdaughter's knife in my back. Barbary Belle was highly skilled with knives.<br><br> "I'm headed to the Stop and Rob," I called downstairs. "Does anyone need anything?"<br><br> The store wasn't really called that, of course; it had a perfectly normal name that I couldn't remember. "Stop and Rob" was more of a general term for a twenty-four-hour gas station and convenience store, a sobriquet earned in the days when the night-shift clerk had been left on his or her own with a till full of thousands of dollars. Technology-cameras, quick-drop safes that didn't open until daylight, and silent alarms-had made working the night shift safer, but they'd always be Stop and Robs to me.<br><br> "Argh," said my husband Adam's voice, traveling up the stairs. "Gold and women and grog!" He didn't play often, but when he did, he played full throttle and immersed.<br><br> "Gold and women and grog!" echoed a chorus of men's voices.<br><br> "Would you listen to them?" said Mary Jo scornfully. "Give me a man who knows what to do with what the good Lord gave him instead of these clueless scallywags who run at the first sight of a real woman."<br><br> "Argh," agreed Auriele, while Jesse giggled.<br><br> "Swab the decks, ye lubbers, lest you slide in the blood and crack your four-pounders," I called. "And whate'er ye do, don't trust Barbary Belle at your back."<br><br> There was a roar of general agreement, and Jesse giggled again.<br><br> "And, Captain Larson," I said, addressing Adam-my mate had taken the name from Jack London's The Sea-Wolf-"you can have gold, and you can have grog. You go after another woman, and you'll be pulling back a stub."<br><br> There was a little silence.<br><br> "Argh," said Adam with renewed enthusiasm. "I got me a woman. What do I need with more? The women are for my men!"<br><br> "Argh!" roared his men. "Bring us gold, grog, and women!"<br><br> "Men!" said Auriele, sweet-voiced. "Bring us a few good men."<br><br> "Stupidheads," growled Honey. "Die!"<br><br> There was a general outcry because, apparently, several someones did.<br><br> I laughed my way out the door.<br><br> After a moment's thought, I took Adam's SUV. I was going to have to figure out what to do for a daily driver. My beloved Vanagon Syncro was getting far too many miles put on her, and her transmission was rare and more precious than gold on the secondary market. I'd been driving her ever since my poor Rabbit had been totaled, and the van was starting to need more and more repairs. I'd looked at an '87 Jetta with a blown engine a few days ago. They wanted too much for it, but maybe I'd just have to pony up.<br><br> The SUV growled the couple of miles to the convenience store that was ten miles closer to home than any other store open at this hour of the night. The clerk was restocking cigarettes and didn't look up as I passed him.<br><br> I picked up two dozen overpriced eggs and three equally overpriced bags of chocolate chips and set them on the counter. The clerk turned away from the cigarettes, looked at me, and froze. He swallowed hard and looked away-scanning the bar codes on the eggs with a hand that shook so much that he might save me the effort of cracking the shells myself.<br><br> "You must be new?" I suggested, running my ATM card in the reader.<br><br> He knew who I was without knowing the important things, I thought.<br><br> I found the limelight disconcerting, but I was slowly getting used to it. My husband was Alpha of the local pack; he'd been a household name in the Tri-Cities since the werewolves first revealed their existence a few years ago. When we'd married, I'd gotten a little of his reflected glory, but after helping to fight a troll on the Cable Bridge a couple of months ago, I had become at least as well-known as Adam. People reacted differently to the reality of werewolves in the world. Sensible people stayed a certain length back. Others were stupidly friendly or not-so-stupidly afraid. The new guy obviously belonged to the latter group.<br><br> "Started last week," the clerk muttered as he bagged the chocolate chips and eggs as if they might bite him.<br><br> "I'm not a werewolf," I told him. "You don't have anything to fear from me. And my husband has put a moratorium on killing gas-station clerks this week."<br><br> The clerk blinked at me.<br><br> "None of the pack will hurt you," I clarified, reminding myself not to try to be funny around people who were too scared to know I was joking. "If you have any trouble with a werewolf or something like that, you can call us"-I found the card holder in my purse and gave him one of the pack's cards, printed on off-white card stock-"at this number. We'll take care of it if we can."<br><br> We all carried the cards now that we'd (my fault) taken on the task of policing the supernatural community of the Tri-Cities, protecting the human citizens from things that go bump in the night. We'd also been called in to find lost children, dogs, and, once, two calves and their guard llama. Zack had composed a song for that one. I hadn't even known he could play guitar.<br><br> Sometimes the job of protecting the Tri-Cities was more glamorous than others. The livestock call, in addition to being musically commemorated, had actually been something of a PR coup: photos of werewolves herding small lost calves back home had gone viral on Facebook.<br><br> The clerk took the card as if it were going to bite him. "Okay," he lied.<br><br> I couldn't do any better than that, so I left with my cookie-making ingredients. I hopped into the SUV and set the bag on the passenger seat as I backed out of the parking space. Frowning, I wondered if his strong reaction might be due to something that had happened to him-a personal incident. I looked both ways before heading out onto the road. Maybe I should go talk to him again.<br><br> I was still worrying about the clerk when there was a loud noise that stole my breath. The bag with the eggs in it flew off the seat, and something hit me with a loud bang and a foul smell-and then there was a sharp pain, followed by . . . nothing.<br><br> I think I woke up several times, for no more than a few minutes that ended abruptly when I moved. I heard people talking, mostly the voices of unfamiliar men, but I couldn�t understand what they were saying. Magic shimmered and itched. Then a warm breath of spring air drifted through the pain and took it all away. I slept, more tired than I ever remembered being.<br><br> When I finally roused, awake and aware for real, I couldn't see anything. I might not have been a werewolf, but a shapeshifting coyote could still see okay in very dim light. Either I was blind, or wherever I was had no light at all.<br><br> My head hurt, my nose hurt, and my left shoulder felt bruised. My mouth was dry and tasted bad, as if I'd gone for a week without brushing my teeth. It felt like I'd just been hit by a troll-though the left-shoulder pain was more of a seat-belt-in-a-car thing. But I couldn't remember . . . even as that thought started to trigger some panic, memories came trickling back.<br><br> I'd been taking a run to our local Stop and Rob-the same all-night gas station slash convenience store where I'd first met lone and gay werewolf Warren all those years ago. Warren had worked out rather well for the pack . . . I gathered my wandering thoughts and herded them down a track that might do some good. The difficulty I had doing that-and the nasty headache-made me think I might have a concussion.<br><br> I considered the loud bang and the eggs and realized that it hadn't been the eggs that had exploded and smelled bad, but the SUV's air bags. I was a mechanic. I knew what blown air bags smelled like. I didn't know what odd effect of shock made me think it might have been the eggs. The suddenness of the accident had combined the related events of the groceries' hitting me and the air bag's hitting me into a cause and effect that didn't exist.<br><br> As my thoughts slowly achieved clarity, I realized that the SUV had been struck from the side, struck at speed to have activated the air bags.<br><br> With that information, I reevaluated my situation without moving. My face was sore-a separate and lesser pain than the headache-and I diagnosed the situation as my having been hit with an air bag or two that hadn't quite saved me from a concussion or its near cousin. The sore left shoulder wasn't serious, nor was the general ache and horrible weariness.<br><br> Probably all of my pain was from the accident . . . car wreck, I supposed, because I was pretty sure it hadn't been an accident. The vehicle that hit me hadn't had its headlights on-I would have remembered headlights. And if it had been a real accident, I'd be in the hospital instead of wherever I was. Under the circumstances, I wasn't too badly damaged . . . but that wasn't right.<br><br> I had a sudden flash of seeing my own rib-but though I was sore, my chest rose and fell without complication. I pushed that memory back, something to be dealt with after I figured out where I was and why.</p><h2>Halloween: The Best of Martha Stewart Living</h2><p>A compendium of the top Halloween ideas published in the magazine over the last decade is divided into two sections including &#34;Tricking,&#34; which includes coverage of pumpkin carving and lighting; and &#34;Treating,&#34; which covers theme parties.

Strikes, outs, steals, foul balls, home runs and more are all explained using a fun mix of Sports Illustrated action photography, simple text with engaging graphics, and a full glossary of essential baseball terms and phrases. An illustrated rookie player character also appears on every page, providing fun facts to help the next generation of fans better understand the game. Perfect for beginning readers, <em>My First Book of Baseball</em> is meant to be a shared reading experience between parents and their young minor league rookies before, during, and after the ball game.</p><p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Introductory books on baseball for young children are perennial favorites, and this one is a fine addition. Each page features an aspect of a game as it is being played. A small cartoon character of a young boy in the corner provides humorous commentary about the players and the action. The book begins with a brief explanation of teams, players, and innings. With photos of a variety of players representing the various major league teams, the pages are bright, colorful, and inviting. In subsequent pages, readers are taken on a journey through an entire game and learn about batters, pitchers, strike zones, runs, walks, balls, and more. Each important term is presented in large capital letters. There are other good informational books on baseball for this grade range, such as Robin Nelson's Baseball Is Fun and Kyle McClellan's Baseball, which offer necessary reviews of the sport, but the format here is more engaging and certainly more entertaining. There is no glossary, but one is not needed as the definitions are given as part of the narrative. VERDICT While there are other suitable introductory books on baseball for youngsters, readers will find the presentation of information enjoyable. Libraries would do well to add this option to their collections.&#x2014;Margaret Nunes, Gwinnett County Public Library, GA"A nice primer to get your youngster interested in the game. You can read it to your three-year-old, or your six-year-old can enjoy it solo."- <b><i>Baseball Musings</i></b>&nbsp;<br><br> "This is a great book for the early, young readers who are just learning the basics of baseball. The format of having the reader go through an actual game is genius; I could really picture this being used in conjunction with a child's first baseball game. It's fun to read aloud adult to child, or-thanks to simple words and big lettering-a book kids can tackle on their own."- <i><b>Literary Hoots</b></i>&nbsp;<br><br> "While there are other suitable introductory books on baseball for youngsters, readers will find the presentation of information [in <i>My First Book of Baseball</i>] enjoyable, more engaging and certainly more entertaining.

But can Agatha make it as a private investigator? After getting mugged on vacation, in what she will always think of as the Paris Incident, she decides to find out.<br><br>Agatha soon learns that running her own detective agency in the Cotswolds is not quite like starring in a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of dames in distress with big shoulder pads, her clients are ladies with missing cats and a man whose son has run off with his car. Agatha even worries that she might be outclassed by her sixty-seven-year-old secretary, Emma Comfrey.<br>But then wealthy divorc�e Catherine Laggat-Brown walks in with their first "real" case. Mrs. Laggat-Brown's daughter has received a death threat, and when Agatha thwarts an attack on the girl at a dinner dance, she recognizes an opportunity to show what Raisin Investigations can do. Even better, the case gives her a chance to reunite with her long-absent friend, Sir Charles Fraith. As they scour the Cotswolds in search of leads, Charles' insights prove invaluable and his charms irresistible, leading poor Emma to fall madly in love with him.<br><br>As ever, Agatha bumbles her way through the case, trying her friends' patience and flirting shamelessly with the chief suspect. Will she put her tiny agency on the map, or has even the outrageous Agatha finally bitten off more than she can chew?<br></p><p><p><b><i>She's outclassed, outmatched, and outgunned </i></b></p><p>Infuriated that her holiday was ruined by a mugging, Agatha Raisin decides to open up her own detective agency. The romance-minded sleuth is thrilled by visions of handsome fellow gumshoes and headline-making crimes but soon finds the only cases she can get are a non-glamorous lot of lost cats and an errant teenager. But when a wealthy divorcee hires the agency to investigate a death threat against her daughter Cassandra, Agatha thwarts a vicious attack on the heiress bride. Now Agatha is in hot pursuit of the culprit. But when the groom's father turns up dead, Agatha must untangle a growing list of suspects, from Carsely's quiet village lanes to Paris' most fashionable streets. Soon the willfully undaunted Agatha is in trouble with French <i>and</i> British police; on the outs (again) with old friends and dead in the sights of a murderer.</p><p><b>"Anyone interested in intelligent, amusing reading will want to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Agatha Raisin."</b><br><b> </b><i><b>Atlanta</b></i><b><i> Journal Constitution</i></b></p><p><b>"I simply love mysteries that have all the requirements necessary to make them great the characters, the action, the plots, and that thing we call humanity.

Bernard Siegfried Albinus was the greatest descriptive anatomist of the eighteenth century. Over a period of twenty years, he produced two volumes of drawings, <i>Tables of the Skeleton and Muscles of the Human Body</i> and <i>Tables of the Human Bones,</i> that have long been revered for their beauty, skill, artistry, and anatomical accuracy. This finely made edition makes them available to the general public at an easily affordable price for the first time since their publication in 1747. <br>All 80 of the original copperplate engravings, containing over 230 individual illustrations, have been painstakingly reproduced for this edition. The muscles and bones of the human body are rendered individually and in related groups from varying perspectives, enabling art students to compare the forms; to analyze their size, shape, direction, and attachments; and to observe with absolute clarity the shape and position of bodily forms. Eighty modern diagrams matching each plate identify each bone and muscle in the most common medical terms. <br>The eminent medical historian Charles Singer praised Albinus' brilliant accomplishment: "He introduced a new standard of accuracy into practical anatomy and of accuracy and beauty into anatomical illustrations." Singer adds: "These illustrations, with their finely wrought ornamental backgrounds, were intended for artists as well as for physicians, and no finer work of their type has ever been executed."<br>Introductory essays by the well-known artist and art educator Terence Coyle &#x2014; including a new introduction to the Dover edition &#x2014; engagingly explore Albinus' life and work. Following these, Robert Beverly Hale, one of America's best-known teachers of figure drawing and anatomy, brilliantly appraises Albinus' technique and demonstrates how artists today can use his anatomical studies to draw from life, a special feature that makes this magnificent book truly indispensable for artists and art students at every level.</p><p></p><h2>Grumbles From The Grave</h2><p>The popular science fiction writer and author of &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34; discusses censorship, the evolution of his style, his virulent atheism, his world travels, bouts with serious illnesses and other topics</p><p>The late Heinlein, considered the "Father of Modern Science Fiction," was also a prolific letter writer. Virginia Heinlein, his wife of 40 years, has skillfully organized a selection of his voluminous correspondence. The result is a memoir that will appeal not just to fans, but to anyone interested in the creative process. Heinlein's letters, mostly addressed to his long-time agent, are grouped into topical chapters: "About Writing Methods and Cutting"; Fan Mail and Other Time Wasters"; and "Stranger," (referring to his novel, Stranger in a Strange Land ). Other chapters cover domestic concerns, travel, etc. Coupled with Virginia Heinlein's commentary, this arrangement helps alleviate the disjointedness often associated with similar compilations. While the book is not autobiographical, it does reveal the psyche of a popular science fiction author. Highly recommended for libraries from high school level on up.<br><i>- Gary D.

Told in his own way, in his own words, a symphony written by the King of Jazz. His story spans and defines a half-century of modern music.This man who created over 1500 compositions was as much at home in Harlem's Cotton Club in the 20s as he was at a White House birthday celebration in his honor in the 60s. For Duke knew everyone and savored them all. Passionate about his music and the people who made music, he counted as his friends hundreds of the musicians who changed the face of music throughout the world: Bechet, Basie, Armstrong, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Sinatra, to name a few of them. Here are 100 photographs to give us an intimate view of Duke's world his family, his friends, his associates.What emerges most strongly in his commitment to music, the mistress for whom he saves the fullest intensity of his passion. &#x201d;Lovers have come and gone, but only my mistress stays,&#x201d; he says. He composed not only songs that all the world has sung, but also suites, sacred works, music for stage and screen and symphonies. This rich book, the embodiment of the life and works of the Duke, is replete with appendices listing singers, arrangers, lyricists and the symphony orchestras with whom the Duke played. There is a book to own and cherish by all who love Jazz and the contributions made to it by the Duke.</p><p></p><h2>Explorers Who Got Lost</h2><p><p>During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries just about every explorer who sailed beyond the horizon to find new land thought he knew where he was going.

Homegoing is her first novel.Effia<br><br>The night effia otcher was born into the musky heat of Fanteland, a fire raged through the woods just outside her father&#x2019;s compound. It moved quickly, tearing a path for days. It lived off the air; it slept in caves and hid in trees; it burned, up and through, unconcerned with what wreckage it left behind, until it reached an Asante village. There, it disappeared, becoming one with the night.<br><br>Effia&#x2019;s father, Cobbe Otcher, left his first wife, Baaba, with the new baby so that he might survey the damage to his yams, that most precious crop known far and wide to sustain families. Cobbe had lost seven yams, and he felt each loss as a blow to his own family. He knew then that the memory of the fire that burned, then fled, would haunt him, his children, and his children&#x2019;s children for as long as the line continued. When he came back into Baaba&#x2019;s hut to find Effia, the child of the night&#x2019;s fire, shrieking into the air, he looked at his wife and said, &#x201c;We will never again speak of what happened today.&#x201d;<br><br>The villagers began to say that the baby was born of the fire, that this was the reason Baaba had no milk. Effia was nursed by Cobbe&#x2019;s second wife, who had just given birth to a son three months before. Effia would not latch on, and when she did, her sharp gums would tear at the flesh around the woman&#x2019;s nipples until she became afraid to feed the baby. Because of this, Effia grew thinner, skin on small birdlike bones, with a large black hole of a mouth that expelled a hungry cry which could be heard throughout the village, even on the days Baaba did her best to smother it, covering the baby&#x2019;s lips with the rough palm of her left hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Love her,&#x201d; Cobbe commanded, as though love were as simple an act as lifting food up from an iron plate and past one&#x2019;s lips. At night, Baaba dreamed of leaving the baby in the dark forest so that the god Nyame could do with her as he pleased.<br><br>Effia grew older. The summer after her third birthday, Baaba had her first son. The boy&#x2019;s name was Fiifi, and he was so fat that sometimes, when Baaba wasn&#x2019;t looking, Effia would roll him along the ground like a ball. The first day that Baaba let Effia hold him, she accidentally dropped him. The baby bounced on his buttocks, landed on his stomach, and looked up at everyone in the room, confused as to whether or not he should cry. He decided against it, but Baaba, who had been stirring banku, lifted her stirring stick and beat Effia across her bare back. Each time the stick lifted off the girl&#x2019;s body, it would leave behind hot, sticky pieces of banku that burned into her flesh. By the time Baaba had finished, Effia was covered with sores, screaming and crying. From the floor, rolling this way and that on his belly, Fiifi looked at Effia with his saucer eyes but made no noise.<br><br>Cobbe came home to find his other wives attending to Effia&#x2019;s wounds and understood immediately what had happened. He and Baaba fought well into the night. Effia could hear them through the thin walls of the hut where she lay on the floor, drifting in and out of a feverish sleep. In her dream, Cobbe was a lion and Baaba was a tree. The lion plucked the tree from the ground where it stood and slammed it back down. The tree stretched its branches in protest, and the lion ripped them off, one by one. The tree, horizontal, began to cry red ants that traveled down the thin cracks between its bark. The ants pooled on the soft earth around the top of the tree trunk.<br><br>And so the cycle began. Baaba beat Effia. Cobbe beat Baaba. By the time Effia had reached age ten, she could recite a history of the scars on her body. The summer of 1764, when Baaba broke yams across her back. The spring of 1767, when Baaba bashed her left foot with a rock, breaking her big toe so that it now always pointed away from the other toes. For each scar on Effia&#x2019;s body, there was a companion scar on Baaba&#x2019;s, but that didn&#x2019;t stop mother from beating daughter, father from beating mother.<br><br>Matters were only made worse by Effia&#x2019;s blossoming beauty. When she was twelve, her breasts arrived, two lumps that sprung from her chest, as soft as mango flesh. The men of the village knew that first blood would soon follow, and they waited for the chance to ask Baaba and Cobbe for her hand. The gifts started. One man tapped palm wine better than anyone else in the village, but another&#x2019;s fishing nets were never empty. Cobbe&#x2019;s family feasted off Effia&#x2019;s burgeoning womanhood. Their bellies, their hands, were never empty.<br><br>In 1775, Adwoa Aidoo became the first girl of the village to be proposed to by one of the British soldiers. She was light-skinned and sharp-tongued. In the mornings, after she had bathed, she rubbed shea butter all over her body, underneath her breasts and between her legs. Effia didn&#x2019;t know her well, but she had seen her naked one day when Baaba sent her to carry palm oil to the girl&#x2019;s hut. Her skin was slick and shiny, her hair regal.<br><br>The first time the white man came, Adwoa&#x2019;s mother asked Effia&#x2019;s parents to show him around the village while Adwoa prepared herself for him.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I come?&#x201d; Effia asked, running after her parents as they walked. She heard Baaba&#x2019;s &#x201c;no&#x201d; in one ear and Cobbe&#x2019;s &#x201c;yes&#x201d; in the other. Her father&#x2019;s ear won, and soon Effia was standing before the first white man she had ever seen.<br><br>&#x201c;He is happy to meet you,&#x201d; the translator said as the white man held his hand out to Effia. She didn&#x2019;t accept it. Instead, she hid behind her father&#x2019;s leg and watched him.<br><br>He wore a coat that had shiny gold buttons down the middle; it strained against his paunch. His face was red, as though his neck were a stump on fire. He was fat all over and sweating huge droplets from his forehead and above his bare lips. Effia started to think of him as a rain cloud: sallow and wet and shapeless.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, he would like to see the village,&#x201d; the translator said, and they all began to walk.<br><br>They stopped first by Effia&#x2019;s own compound. &#x201c;This is where we live,&#x201d; Effia told the white man, and he smiled at her dumbly, his green eyes hidden in fog.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t understand. Even after his translator spoke to him, he didn&#x2019;t understand.<br><br>Cobbe held Effia&#x2019;s hand as he and Baaba led the white man through the compound. &#x201c;Here, in this village,&#x201d; Cobbe said, &#x201c;each wife has her own hut. This is the hut she shares with her children. When it is her husband&#x2019;s night to be with her, he goes to her in her hut.&#x201d;<br><br>The white man&#x2019;s eyes grew clearer as the translation was given, and suddenly Effia realized that he was seeing through new eyes. The mud of her hut&#x2019;s walls, the straw of the roof, he could finally see them.<br><br>They continued on through the village, showing the white man the town square, the small fishing boats formed from hollowed-out tree trunks that the men carried with them when they walked the few miles down to the coast. Effia forced herself to see things through new eyes, too. She smelled the sea-salt wind as it touched the hairs in her nose, felt the bark of a palm tree as sharp as a scratch, saw the deep, deep red of the clay that was all around them.<br><br>&#x201c;Baaba,&#x201d; Effia asked once the men had walked farther ahead of them, &#x201c;why will Adwoa marry this man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because her mother says so.&#x201d;<br><br>A few weeks later, the white man came back to pay respects to Adwoa&#x2019;s mother, and Effia and all of the other villagers gathered around to see what he would offer. There was the bride price of fifteen pounds. There were goods he&#x2019;d brought with him from the Castle, carried on the backs of Asantes. Cobbe made Effia stand behind him as they watched the servants come in with fabric, millet, gold, and iron.<br><br>When they walked back to their compound, Cobbe pulled Effia aside, letting his wives and other children walk in front of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you understand what just happened?&#x201d; he asked her. In the distance, Baaba slipped her hand into Fiifi&#x2019;s. Effia&#x2019;s brother had just turned eleven, but he could already climb up the trunk of a palm tree using nothing but his bare hands and feet for support.<br><br>&#x201c;The white man came to take Adwoa away,&#x201d; Effia said.<br><br>Her father nodded. &#x201c;The white men live in the Cape Coast Castle. There, they trade goods with our people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like iron and millet?&#x201d;<br><br>Her father put his hand on her shoulder and kissed the top of her forehead, but when he pulled away the look in his eyes was troubled and distant. &#x201c;Yes, we get iron and millet, but we must give them things in return. That man came from Cape Coast to marry Adwoa, and there will be more like him who will come and take our daughters away. But you, my own, I have bigger plans for you than to live as a white man&#x2019;s wife. You will marry a man of our village.&#x201d;<br><br>Baaba turned around just then, and Effia caught her eyes. Baaba scowled. Effia looked at her father to see if he had noticed, but Cobbe did not say a word.<br><br>Effia knew who her choice for husband would be, and she dearly hoped her parents would choose the same man. Abeeku Badu was next in line to be the village chief. He was tall, with skin like the pit of an avocado and large hands with long, slender fingers that he waved around like lightning bolts every time he spoke. He had visited their compound four times in the last month, and later that week, he and Effia were to share a meal together.<br><br>Abeeku brought a goat. His servants carried yams and fish and palm wine. Baaba and the other wives stoked their fires and heated the oil. The air smelled rich.<br><br>That morning, Baaba had plaited Effia&#x2019;s hair. Two long braids on either side of her center part. They made her look like a ram, strong, willful. Effia had oiled her naked body and put gold in her ears. She sat across from Abeeku as they ate, pleased as he stole appreciative glances.<br><br>&#x201c;Were you at Adwoa&#x2019;s ceremony?&#x201d; Baaba asked once all of the men had been served and the women finally began to eat.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I was there, but only briefly. It is a shame Adwoa will be leaving the village. She would have made a good wife.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you work for the British when you become chief?&#x201d; Effia asked. Cobbe and Baaba sent her sharp looks, and she lowered her head, but she lifted it to find Abeeku smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;We work with the British, Effia, not for them. That is the meaning of trade. When I am chief, we will continue as we have, facilitating trade with the Asantes and the British.&#x201d;<br><br>Effia nodded. She wasn&#x2019;t exactly sure what this meant, but she could tell from her parents&#x2019; looks that it was best to keep her mouth shut. Abeeku Badu was the first man they had brought to meet her. Effia wanted desperately for him to want her, but she did not yet know what kind of man he was, what kind of woman he required. In her hut, Effia could ask her father and Fiifi anything she wanted. It was Baaba who practiced silence and preferred the same from Effia, Baaba who had slapped her for asking why she did not take her to be blessed as all the other mothers did for their daughters. It was only when Effia didn&#x2019;t speak or question, when she made herself small, that she could feel Baaba&#x2019;s love, or something like it. Maybe this was what Abeeku wanted too.<br><br>Abeeku finished eating. He shook hands with everyone in the family, and stopped by Effia&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;You will let me know when she is ready,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Baaba clutched a hand to her chest and nodded soberly. Cobbe and the other men saw Abeeku off as the rest of the family waved.<br><br>That night, Baaba woke Effia up while she was sleeping on the floor of their hut. Effia felt the warmth of her mother&#x2019;s breath against her ear as she spoke. &#x201c;When your blood comes, Effia, you must hide it. You must tell me and no one else,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you understand?&#x201d; She handed Effia palm fronds that she had turned into soft, rolled sheets. &#x201c;Place these inside of you, and check them every day. When they turn red, you must tell me.&#x201d;<br><br>Effia looked at the palm fronds, held in Baaba&#x2019;s outstretched hands. She didn&#x2019;t take them at first, but when she looked up again there was something like desperation in her mother&#x2019;s eyes. And because the look had softened Baaba&#x2019;s face somehow, and because Effia also knew desperation, that fruit of longing, she did as she was told. Every day, Effia checked for red, but the palm fronds came out greenish-white as always. In the spring, the chief of the village grew ill, and everyone watched Abeeku carefully to see if he was ready for the task. He married two women in those months, Arekua the Wise, and Millicent, the half-caste daughter of a Fante woman and a British soldier. The soldier had died from fever, leaving his wife and two children much wealth to do with as they pleased. Effia prayed for the day all of the villagers would call her Effia the Beauty, as Abeeku called her on the rare occasions when he was permitted to speak to her.<br><br>Millicent&#x2019;s mother had been given a new name by her white husband. She was a plump, fleshy woman with teeth that twinkled against the dark night of her skin. She had decided to move out of the Castle and into the village once her husband died. Because the white men could not leave money in their wills to their Fante wives and children, they left it to other soldiers and friends, and those friends paid the wives. Millicent&#x2019;s mother had been given enough money for a new start and a piece of land. She and Millicent would often come visit Effia and Baaba, for, as she said, they would soon be a part of the same family.<br><br>Millicent was the lightest-skinned woman Effia had ever seen. Her black hair reached down to the middle of her back and her eyes were tinged with green. She rarely smiled, and she spoke with a husky voice and a strange Fante accent.<br><br>&#x201c;What was it like in the Castle?&#x201d; Baaba asked Millicent&#x2019;s mother one day while the four women were sitting to a snack of groundnuts and bananas.<br><br>&#x201c;It was fine, fine. They take care of you, oh, these men! It is like they have never been with a woman before. I don&#x2019;t know what their British wives were doing. I tell you, my husband looked at me like I was water and he was fire, and every night he had to be put out.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The women laughed. Millicent slipped Effia a smile, and Effia wanted to ask her what it was like with Abeeku, but she did not dare. <br> &nbsp;<br> Baaba leaned in close to Millicent&#x2019;s mother, but still Effia could hear, &#x201c;And they pay a good bride price, eh?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Enh, I tell you, my husband paid my mother ten pounds, and that was fifteen years ago! To be sure, my sister, the money is good, but I for one am glad my daughter has married a Fante. Even if a soldier offered to pay twenty pounds, she would not get to be the wife of a chief. And what&#x2019;s worse, she would have to live in the Castle, far from me. No, no, it is better to marry a man of the village so that your daughters can stay close to you.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Baaba nodded and turned toward Effia, who quickly looked away. That night, just two days after her fifteenth birthday, the blood came. It was not the powerful rush of the ocean waves that Effia had expected it to be, but rather a simple trickle, rain dripping, drop by drop, from the same spot of a hut&#x2019;s roof. She cleaned herself off and waited for her father to leave Baaba so that she could tell her. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Baaba,&#x201d; she said, showing her the palm fronds painted red. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have...</p><h2>Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign-By-Reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt With 350 Illustrations 130 in Color</h2><p>Who was the first king of ancient Egypt - and who was the last? Which Egyptian queens ruled in their own right? What do we really know about the 170 or more pharaohs whose names have come down to us?<br>Chronicle of the Pharaohs is the first book to set down in narrative form, using timelines and other visual aids throughout, all the rulers and dynasties of Egypt in their chronological order.

From Narmer, who first united the lands along the Nile, to Cleopatra some 3000 years later, we see the way in which individual pharaohs helped to shape Egyptian civilization, and were themselves shaped by it. The narrative is supplemented by specially drawn cartouches of each pharaoh and translations of their names.<br>Chronicle of the Pharaohs is at once a book to be enjoyed as popular history, an essential work of reference, and a visual introduction to the extraordinary diversity and richness of an ancient civilization.

Keeping her arms straight, she began going through the motions again.<br><br>It seemed to Christy that the first few days of practice hadn&#x2019;t been very hard or very competitive. Now that it was getting closer to tryouts, fewer girls were showing up every<br>day. And the ones who did show up were, in Christy&#x2019;s opinion, all much better at jumps than she&#x2019;d ever be. <br><br>&#x201c;Give it a rest, Miller!&#x201d; one of the varsity girls said, coming in her direction. It was Renee, a junior with short dark hair and eyes like a raven.<br><br>Christy tried to ignore Renee and finished the cheer with a solid jump.<br><br>&#x201c;Give it up.

And I&#x2019;m not going to drop out.&#x201d; <br><br>Christy meant the statement to sound firm and threatening, but it affected Renee as much as a harmless kitten batting at a thread.<br><br>&#x201c;You only made it this far because of Rick Doyle.&#x201d; Renee flung the words at Christy.

You&#x2019;re not good enough to be a cheerleader, and you&#x2019;re definitely not good enough for Rick Doyle.&#x201d; Renee turned with a flashy cheerleading swish and marched off the field with her two friends beside her.<br><br>&#x201c;What was that all about?&#x201d; Christy asked Teri. Her hands were shaking. &#x201c;What did I ever do to her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not you.&#x201d; Teri wrapped her long, wavy brown hair up in a knot and tried to secure it with a scrunchie. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s mad at Rick, and she&#x2019;s just taking it out on you. Don&#x2019;t let her get to you. You&#x2019;re doing great, Christy. By the time tryouts get here, you&#x2019;ll be ready. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br>But Christy did worry. She worried all the way home. As soon as she was in the front door, the first thing she did was call her closest friend, Katie, to tell her about the incident.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh come on, Christy,&#x201d; Katie said in her bubbly, self-assured voice. &#x201c;You know what Renee&#x2019;s problem is. It&#x2019;s Rick. She likes Rick. Didn&#x2019;t you know that? Everybody<br>knows that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katie, almost all the girls at Kelley High like Rick. He and I are good friends. You know that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure I do. But Renee doesn&#x2019;t. She thinks he&#x2019;s taking you to the prom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The prom? Why in the world would she think that? My parents would never let me go to the prom. You know how strict they are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, get this,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;I heard that Renee asked Rick to the prom, and he turned her down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding! Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;s so upset about. He didn&#x2019;t give her a reason, but from what she heard from one of his friends, Renee thought he was taking you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way! He&#x2019;d never ask me. He could choose from a dozen girls, all seniors. Besides, I think a senior guy should take a senior girl. I mean, it&#x2019;s their last year of high school<br>and everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Christy, get a clue! He wants to take you. The problem is, he thinks you won&#x2019;t go with him since you&#x2019;re not supposed to date until you&#x2019;re sixteen.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy twisted the phone cord around her finger. &#x201c;But Katie, I&#x2019;m the kind of girl Rick teases and calls when he&#x2019;s bored. I&#x2019;m not the popular rah-rah type he&#x2019;d take to the prom. He&#x2019;s probably waiting to find out who&#x2019;s got the best chance of winning prom queen. That&#x2019;s who he&#x2019;ll take.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, girl! Don&#x2019;t you see what&#x2019;s happening? Rick is turning you into the rah-rah prom-queen type. You&#x2019;re like putty in his hands. He&#x2019;s making you into the perfect girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katie, that has to be the most ridiculous thing you&#x2019;ve ever said!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ridiculous or not, it&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201d;<br><br>A frustrating silence hung between them.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt your feelings,&#x201d; Katie said, all the fire doused from her voice. &#x201c;But if you don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m right, then just ask yourself to honestly answer one question.&#x201d;Katie paused.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Christy knew that although Katie often went overboard with her exuberance, she also could be right sometimes.<br><br>&#x201c;Ask yourself, <i>Would I have tried out for cheerleading if Rick hadn&#x2019;t talked me into it and gone with me to practice the first day?</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Christy answered immediately. &#x201c;I would&#x2019;ve gone on my own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t answer me. Answer yourself. Honestly. And if you&#x2019;re honest, I think you&#x2019;ll see what I&#x2019;m saying. Rick has more control in your life than you realize.&#x201d;<br><br>For at least twenty minutes after they hung up, Christy remained sitting on the hallway floor with her back against one wall and her stocking feet against the other, searching her heart for an honest answer to Katie&#x2019;s question.<br><br>The tricky part was, Christy had always wanted to be a cheerleader. She had thought about it a lot when tryouts were announced. But maybe Katie had a point. Deep down, Christy wasn&#x2019;t sure if she ever would have worked up the nerve to try out if Rick hadn&#x2019;t coaxed her into going to the first practice.<br><br>However, Todd had a lot to do with it too. If Katie wanted to talk about Todd&#x2019;s influence on Christy, well, that was another story. She would gladly admit that Todd had a unique way of challenging her and directing her decisions. He had ever since the day they met on the beach last summer. She remembered looking up into the screaming silver-blue eyes of this tall, blond surfer and thinking how he fit her description of the perfect guy. Then she got to<br>know him, and Todd became an important part of her life. He strongly influenced her when it came to things that mattered in her heart.<br><br>Even though Todd lived two hours away, when it came right down to it, if she had to define their relationship, she would consider Todd much closer to one day being her boyfriend than Rick. Christy and Todd saw each other only a couple times a month, but Todd was in her heart. Forever. Nothing could ever change that. And what mattered to Todd mattered deeply to Christy.<br><br>She tugged at her socks, cuffing them and uncuffing them, remembering when she had scrunched in the hallway last week, the night before the first cheerleading practice, and talked on the phone with Todd for an hour. Christy had told him all about how she was thinking of going out for cheerleading and eagerly waited for his opinion and<br>encouragement.<br><br>But all Todd had said was, &#x201c;I think if you&#x2019;re going to do it, you should do it for the Lord.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean I should pray about it?&#x201d; Christy asked.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of it. But you need to think about how you can take some risks on your campus. If you become a cheerleader, you&#x2019;ll have an audience.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An audience?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There will be lots of people who suddenly know who you are, and they&#x2019;ll watch your life a lot more closely. You can&#x2019;t just blend in with the crowd anymore. Being a cheerleader might put you in a good position to let people know who you really are and what your life is all about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t thought about that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Being up front can be good. It kind of forces you to take a stand for what you believe.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy had taken Todd&#x2019;s words to heart, and that night<br>she had written in her diary:<br><br><i>God, I want to do this cheerleading thing for You. I know Todd&#x2019;s<br>right. If I become a cheerleader, people will look up to me and<br>respect me. That will give me a better chance to tell them that I&#x2019;m a<br>Christian and maybe to invite them to church with me or something.<br>I just want whatever is best, and I want to be a good example to<br>others.<br><br></i>In thinking through the whole situation now, Christy felt certain that even if Rick hadn&#x2019;t walked her to practice that first day, she still would have gone. Her heart was set on doing this, and just as Todd had advised, she would do it for all the right reasons.<br><br>&#x201c;Christy,&#x201d; her mom called from the kitchen, &#x201c;are you off the phone yet? Dinner is ready. You need to come set the table.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; Christy left her cheerleading thoughts huddled in the hallway as she went into the kitchen. Her mom had made stew, which wasn&#x2019;t her favorite dinner. Mom&#x2019;s stew generally consisted of whatever leftovers had been in the refrigerator long enough to be unappealing if eaten by themselves. They were all dumped into the Crock-Pot in the morning and left to simmer all day until they became &#x201c;stew.&#x201d;<br><br>Venturing a sniff of the concoction, Christy had to admit it smelled good. She teased her mom, saying, &#x201c;Spices are your friends, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know how to put in just the right seasonings to make even leftovers smell as though you started fresh.&#x201d; Mom gave Christy a puzzled look.<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; She realized what she was saying was not exactly a compliment and would be better left unexplained.<br><br>Her mother stepped in to make a familiar point. &#x201c;We need to be thankful we have food on the table, Christy. It may not be fancy, but we&#x2019;ve never gone hungry, and we should be grateful for that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Christy said quietly. She pulled the silverware from the drawer and began setting four places at the kitchen table. The last thing she wanted to be reminded of tonight was how tight money had been since her family moved to California from Wisconsin. Or how all of them needed to work harder to stay on their budget.<br><br>At dinner, Christy&#x2019;s nine-year-old brother, David, monopolized the conversation. Christy and her mom and dad all listened patiently as David reenacted, with considerable exaggeration, his teacher&#x2019;s facial expression when she found gum on her shoe.<br><br>He was kind of funny, for a little brother. But Christy would never tell him that. It would only encourage his goofiness.<br><br>As soon as David excused himself from the table, Mom leaned over, and a sweet smile spread over her lips. Christy knew that look. Her mother was trying to create an encouraging<br>environment. Christy also knew that her mother was about to say something Christy probably wouldn&#x2019;t be glad to hear. &#x201c;Dad and I have gone over the paper you brought home<br>from the cheerleading adviser, and we&#x2019;ve decided that the only way for this to work is if you find a way to come up with half of the money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Half!&#x201d; Christy squawked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s more than three hundred dollars!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Dad said slowly in his deep, authoritative voice, &#x201c;is this something you want to do? Are you willing to commit yourself to the practices and the games?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Christy tried hard to hold back the tears that pressed against the corners of her eyelids.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mother and I think it&#x2019;s a worthwhile goal. It&#x2019;s also a big commitment. And an expensive one. We feel you should share a part of that responsibility by participating in<br>the financial responsibility.&#x201d;<br><br>Christy wanted to say, &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t understand! There&#x2019;s more to this than me fulfilling my goal. Can&#x2019;t you see that? This is something I need to do so I can take a stand on my campus.&#x201d; But as usual, Christy couldn&#x2019;t make the really powerful words come out, and all she said was, &#x201c;How am I going to come up with that much money?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have to understand, Christy, that this expense isn&#x2019;t in our budget. But we&#x2019;re willing to find a way for it to work out for you if you&#x2019;re willing to come up with your half. You could babysit this summer,&#x201d; Mom suggested. &#x201c;Get a position during the weekdays with someone who has small children. Perhaps you could advertise in the toddler Sunday school class you&#x2019;ve been helping out with the last few weeks. You could let some of the parents know<br>you&#x2019;re available.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Babysit? This summer?&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t a good time to mention to her parents that she had been planning to stay in Newport Beach all summer with Uncle Bob and Aunt Marti, just like last summer. Christy already had a long list of plans for things she and Todd would do. She hadn&#x2019;t even considered the possibility of staying home in Escondido all summer&#x2013;especially to babysit.<br><br>&#x201c;You decide how you want to come up with the money,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re serious about cheerleading, we&#x2019;re with you 100 percent, and we&#x2019;ll find a way to come up with half the cost. But you&#x2019;ve got to put in your share too. It&#x2019;s time you learned there are no free rides.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I definitely want to do it. I mean, I want to at least try out and see what happens,&#x201d; Christy said.<br><br>Mom sat back in her chair. &#x201c;Before you give such a firm answer, why don&#x2019;t you think about it some more. In the meantime, do you have much homework tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do the dishes, then,&#x201d; her mom said. &#x201c;You can do them tomorrow night. You&#x2019;d better get at your homework.&#x201d;<br><br>In the sanctuary of her room, Christy found it impossible to concentrate on her &#x201c;tons&#x201d; of homework. She went over to her dresser and picked up the San Francisco music box her aunt had bought her on their trip there last summer.<br><br>Winding the brass key on the bottom, Christy set it back on the dresser and watched the ceramic cable car move up the little hill as it played &#x201c;I Left My Heart in San Francisco.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Wish I knew where I left my heart. It certainly doesn&#x2019;t seem to be where it&#x2019;s supposed to be tonight, </i>Christy thought. <i>I feel pulled in so many directions.<br><br></i>She was convinced that becoming a cheerleader ranked as an important dream at this point in her life. It was a worthy goal. Weren&#x2019;t adults always telling her to set goals? She believed being a cheerleader would be something she could always look back on and say, &#x201c;I did it! I worked hard, and I accomplished my goal.&#x201d; Plus, she would be able to take a stand for what she believed, as Todd had said.<br><br>But she never dreamed she would have to come up with half the money. And babysitting all summer was practically the last thing C...</p><h2>Lady Almina and the Story of the Real Downton Abbey. Lady Almina</h2><p>Lady Fiona Carnarvon became the chatelaine of Highclere Castle - the setting of the hit series Downton Abbey - eight years ago. In that time she&#39;s become fascinated by the rich history of Highclere, and by the extraordinary people who lived there over the centuries. One person particularly captured Fiona&#39;s imagination - Lady Almina, the 5th Countess of Carnarvon. Almina was the illegitimate daughter of banking tycoon Alfred de Rothschild. She was his only daughter and he doted on her. She married the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, at 19, with an enormous dowry. At first, life at Highclere was a dizzying mix of sumptuous banquets for 500 and even the occasional royal visitor. Almina oversaw 80 members of staff - many of whom came from families who had worked at Highclere for generations. But when the First World War broke out, life at Highclere changed forever. History intervened and Almina and the staff of Highclere were thrown into one of the most turbulent times of the last century. Almina was forced to draw on her deepest reserves of courage in order to ensure her family, the staff and the castle survived. This is the remarkable story of a lost time. But Highclere remains and in this book, Fiona weaves Almina&#39;s journey and those of her family into the heritage and history of one of England&#39;s most exquisite Victorian castles.</p><p>Lady Fiona Carnarvon married the current Earl of Carnarvon in 1999, and they took over Highclere eight years ago.A loving and faithful portrait of Almina and her world. * <i>BBC Countryfile Magazine</i> * Comfort reading for fans eagerly awaiting the next instalment of Downtown Abbey to appear on our TV screens. * <i>Vogue (Australia</i> * bright, breezy and unpretentious in style. * <i>Guardian</i> *</p><h2>Memory Wall: Stories</h2><p><b>From an award-winning and extraordinarily eloquent author whose "prose dazzles" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) comes a second stunning collection.</b><br><br>Set on four continents, Anthony Doerr's new stories are about memory, the source of meaning and coherence in our lives, the fragile thread that connects us to ourselves and to others. Every hour, says Doerr, all over the globe, an infinite number of memories disappear. Yet at the same time children, surveying territory that is entirely new to them, push back the darkness, form fresh memories, and remake the world.<br><br>In the luminous and beautiful title story, a young boy in South Africa comes to possess an old woman's secret, a piece of the past with the power to redeem a life. In "The River Nemunas," a teenage orphan moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather, and discovers a world in which myth becomes real. "Village 113," winner of an O'Henry Prize, is about the building of the Three Gorges Dam and the seed keeper who guards the history of a village soon to be submerged. And in "Afterworld," the radiant, cathartic final story, a woman who escaped the Holocaust is haunted by visions of her childhood friends in Germany, yet finds solace in the tender ministrations of her grandson.<br><br>Every story in&nbsp;<i>Memory Wall</i>&nbsp;is a reminder of the grandeur of life--of the mysterious beauty of seeds, of fossils, of sturgeon, of clouds, of radios, of leaves, of the breathtaking fortune of living in this universe. Doerr's language, his witness, his imagination, and his humanity are unparalleled in fiction today.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2010</strong>: Books made of linked stories, like recent award-winning favorites <em>Olive Kitteridge</em> and <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>, are usually connected by shared places and people. The tender and lyrical stories in Anthony Doerr's <em>Memory Wall</em> are linked no less strongly, but, as if Oliver Sacks had turned to fiction, by a neurological theme. Set as far apart as South Africa and the Korean DMZ, Doerr's stories circle around the central pull of memory, both the struggle against memory's loss and the weight of memories that remain. In the long and brilliantly intricate title story, as memories fade from an aging white woman in suburban Cape Town, they are stored for her (and for anyone else with compatible ports installed in their head) in replayable cartridges. In the final story, "Afterworld," girls from a Jewish orphanage who were murdered by Nazis survive decades later as ghosts in the visionary epileptic seizures of the one girl who survived them. If memories in these tales are like the Yangtze River town in "Village 113," threatened with the forced forgetfulness of a man-made flood, they are also like the legendary sturgeon in "The River Nemunas," which surfaces with an ancient, armor-covered dignity years after it was thought to have vanished. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><br> <br> <p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Anthony Doerr</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The title story in your collection grew out of an assignment from <em>McSweeney's</em> to "travel somewhere in the world and imagine life there in 2024" (as part of this special issue). I loved how your story dealt with the near future, with just a few small but fantastic details that seem like they could something of our time. How did you like writing fiction to an assignment like that?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> I loved it. It gave me permission to take a risk I had wanted to take, but worried I couldn&#x2019;t pull off: namely, the idea that someone's memories could someday be harvested, stored, and traded. A couple of years ago, I reviewed a book for the <em>Boston Globe</em> called <em>What We Believe but Cannot Prove</em> in which a neuroscientist named Terrence Sejnowski speculates that someday soon we might be able to locate specific memories in the "extracellular machinery" of our heads and stain them. I had been fascinated by that idea for months, primarily because it reminded me of hunting fossils: looking for one record in a world that generally does not allow such records. I had simultaneously been writing some (lousy) essays about my own memories of my grandmother's descent into dementia. It wasn't until <em>McSweeney's</em> came calling that I gave myself permission to try to braid together a story all these enthusiasms: Alzheimer's and grandma and fossils and South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> South Africa isn't the only far-flung place you write about in this book, much like your previous collection, <em>The Shell Collector</em>: you also set stories in China, Korea, Germany, and Estonia (and, yes, Wyoming). Do you always have to visit a place to imagine a story there, and to imagine the memories its inhabitants might hold?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> Not always. Sometimes a place can be so real, so brimming-over with color and noise and detail, that trying to figure out which details to select for a piece of fiction can be overwhelming. Ultimately I'm trying to write stories inside which a reader is transported; I want readers to have an experience that allows them to enter the time and place and life of someone else. And I want that experience of empathy to be continuous; I don't want the dream of the fiction to be broken by any carelessness on my part. That's the most I can hope for: that a reader might leave his or her world for an hour or two and enter the world of one of my characters. And if a reader is going to be nice enough to read one of my stories, it's up to me to make that world as convincing and seamless as possible. So, certainly, travel can help bring a place to life: its smells, its skies, its birds, its light. In the best case scenario, I start a story set somewhere I have visited previously, and then, once the story is mostly drafted, I return to the place to harvest whatever last details I can find.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Many of your stories are about very private and personal experiences of some of our most public and collective dramas: the Holocaust, the aftermath of apartheid, the flooding of the Yangtze. Is that gap between public and private memory one of the engines for your fiction?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> Yes, yes, yes. We tend to believe history is about collective memory, about voiceovers and textbooks and pop quizzes, but for me history is about individuals. The glory and genius of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>, for example, is in the ordinary, quotidian day-to-day detailing of the writing: the things they eat, the jokes they tell. The horror comes through because of the mundanity. I read that book when I was fourteen, the same age as Anne, and the lessons of that little diary have stayed with me: first, that through books, the memories of the dead can live; and second, that the path to the universal is through the individual. Only through the smallest details, through the sights and smells and sounds of one person's moment-by-moment experience, can a writer convey the immensity that is a human life.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Publishers don't quite know what to do with novellas, but many of my very favorite stories fall into that in-between length. What do you like about working within its boundaries? Are there novellas you love? Perhaps the great novella of the English language, Joyce's "The Dead," is also one of the great memory tales. Is there something about that size that suits storytelling about memory?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> I love long stories and novellas. They can manage to be bigger than slice-of-life short stories, stories that compress or truncate lives as so many contemporary short stories tend to. In a novella you can work with bigger scales, with a character's birth and death, and with his or her memories. And, yet, because of their relative brevity, because a reader can read a novella in a single day, on a single airplane flight, they can often be more intense, more involving, and more shattering than novels. <br><br>That said, you&#x2019;re right, writing them can be scary, because only a very brave publisher is going to produce a book that's less than 150 pages long, and only a very brave magazine is going to run a story longer than 30 pages. So as a writer you feel yourself plunge off a small cliff when you hit about 10,000 words and realize you have 10,000 to go.&nbsp; <br><br>At first you might be scared, anyway, but soon afterward there's a certain release. You think: This thing I'm making is not going to sell for a pile of money, this is not my Big Novel; it's just a novella, and I'm going to take whatever risks I want to with it.&nbsp; <br><br>I'm actually very interested in how e-readers like the Kindle are going to change the way writers work and readers read. Theoretically, it could be much easier for a publishing house to take a chance on a novella if they don't have to pay for the production costs. Who knows, maybe short stories and novellas are tailor-made for the electronic medium?<br><br>Novellas I love? My absolute favorite is Katherine Anne Porter's "Pale Horse, Pale Rider" (though, interestingly, in her introduction to her collected stories, Porter insists that "Pale Horse, Pale Rider" be called a "long story"). And of course Tolstoy's<em> The Death of Ivan Ilych</em>, which everyone should read once every ten years.&nbsp; And of course, "The Dead", as you mentioned. As for living writers, I love Andrea Barrett's "Ship Fever" and "Servants of the Map" and a little known one by Denis Johnson called "Train Dreams" that I encountered in the <em>2003 O. Henry Prize Stories</em>.<br></p> <br> <br>Anthony Doerr is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>.

A work with one metaphorical foot planted in the Florentine Renaissance literary tradition of Boccaccio&#x2019;s <i>Decameron</i> and the other in works ranging from John Bunyan, Voltaire, and Mark Twain to the popular entertainments of our own time, <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> stands astride the cultures of Great Britain and America, and much of Europe, like a benign colossus. <br><br>Beyond its importance as a cultural touchstone and literary work of unvarnished genius, Chaucer&#x2019;s unfinished epic poem is also one of the most beloved works in the English language&#x2013;and for good reason: It is lively, absorbing, perceptive, and outrageously funny&#x2013;an undisputed classic that has held a special appeal for generations of readers. Chaucer has gathered twenty-nine of literature&#x2019;s most indelible archetypes&#x2013;from the exalted Knight to the bawdy Wife to the besotted Miller to the humble Plowman&#x2013;in a vivid group portrait that captures the full spectrum of late-medieval English society and both informs and expands our discourse on the human condition.<br><br>Presented in these pages in a new unabridged translation by the esteemed poet, translator, and scholar Burton Raffel&#x2013;whose translation of Beowulf has sold more than a million copies&#x2013;this Modern Library edition also features an Introduction by the well-known and widely influential medievalist and author John Miles Foley that discusses Chaucer&#x2019;s work as well as to his life and times.<br><br>Despite the brilliance of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x2019;s work, the continual evolution of our language has rendered his words unfamiliar to many of us. Burton Raffel&#x2019;s magnificent new translation brings Chaucer&#x2019;s poetry back to life, ensuring that none of the original&#x2019;s wit, wisdom, or humanity is lost to the modern reader.</p><p>On a spring day in April--sometime in the waning years of the 14th century--29 travelers set out for Canterbury on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Thomas Beckett. Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. Each book provides close reading of the text, as well as giving a full account of its historical, cultural and intellectual background, a discussion of its influence, and further reading.</p><h2>Beyond Basic Photography: A Technical Manual</h2><p>Answers the more technical questions of photographers who are already familiar with the basics so well detailed in Henry Horenstein&#39;s recent Black and White Photography.</p><p></p><h2>Doctor Turner&#39;s Casebook</h2><p>Call The Midwife is the BBC&#39;s most popular drama ever - that is what viewing figures tell us with over ten million viewers per episode.

Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse -- the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. The two boys are united by their accountability for a single horrific act; an act that has triggered a police investigation and shattered the comfortable, insulated worlds of their families. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children. As civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple show just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, <i>The Dinner</i> promises to be the topic of countless dinner party debates. Skewering everything from parenting values to pretentious menus to political convictions, this novel reveals the dark side of genteel society and asks what each of us would do in the face of unimaginable tragedy.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2013</strong><strong>:</strong> A good unreliable narrator is one of the most satisfying characters a novelist can dream up--and Herman Koch takes us on a hell of a ride through the mind of Paul Lohman, the deliciously sinister host of <em>The Dinner</em>. Paul's 15-year-old son, Michel, has committed an unspeakable crime; his brother, on the cusp of becoming the Netherlands' next prime minister, has a delicate wife and two teenagers who share Michel&#x2019;s secret; Paul's wife, Claire, will do anything to protect their boy. As the two couples inch through an excruciating meal at a chic restaurant--their children's whereabouts uncertain--Paul peels back the layers of their situation, weaving to and fro through time and truth. Koch's finely structured story gives away just enough on each page to keep us riveted, feeling like private investigators on the verge of discovery, until the shock of an ending. It's no small feat for the author that the less we trust Paul, the more we want to hear what he has to say. --<em>Mia Lipman</em><p>Herman Koch is the author of seven novels and three collections of short stories. <i>The Dinner</i>, his sixth novel, has been published in 25 countries and was the winner of the Publieksprijs Prize in 2009.

Byatt<br><br>Willa Cather&#x2019;s story of the missionary priest Father Jean Marie Latour and his work of faith in the wilderness of the Southwest is told with a spare but sensuous directness and profound artistry. When Latour arrives in 1851 in the territory of New Mexico, newly acquired by the United States, what he finds is a vast desert region of red hills and tortured arroyos that is American by law but Mexican and Indian in custom and belief. Over the next four decades, Latour works gently and tirelessly to spread his faith and to build a soaring cathedral out of the local golden rock&#x2014;while contending with unforgiving terrain, derelict and sometimes rebellious priests, and his own loneliness.<br><br>DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP shares a limitless, craggy beauty with the New Mexico landscape of desert, mountain, and canyon in which its central action takes place, and its evocations of that landscape and those who are drawn to it suggest why Cather is acknowledged without question as the most poetically exact chronicler of the American frontier.</p><p>Death Comes for the Archbishop sprang from Willa Cather&#39;s love for the land and cultures of the American Southwest. Published in 1927 to both praise and perplexity, it has since claimed for itself a major place in twentieth-century literature. The narrative follows Bishop Jean Latour and Father Joseph Vaillant, friends since their childhood in France, as they organize the new Roman Catholic diocese of Santa Fe subsequent to the Mexican War. While seeking to revive the church and build a cathedral in the desert, the clerics, like their historical prototypes, Bishop Jean Laury and Father Joseph Machebeuf, face religious corruption, natural adversity, and the loneliness of living in a strange and unforgiving land. The historical essay traces the artistic and spiritual development that led to its writing. The broad-ranging explanatory notes illuminate the elements of French, Mexican, Hispanic, and Native American cultures that meet in the course of the narrative, they also explain the part played by the land and its people - their history, religion, art, and languages.Introduction by A.

As he weaves his tales of death and danger, of action and mstery, he generates an explosive edge-of-the-seat excitement that few writers can match. In The Eiger Sanction, Trevanian&#39;s highly acclaimed first novel, Jonathan Hemlock, mountain climber and professional assassin, is tricked into a most hazardous assignment that involves an attempt to conquer and scale one of the most treacherous mountain peaks in the Swiss Alps, the Eiger. Hemlock&#39;s highly skilled services are required in The Loo Sanction to recover a set of films incriminating high-ranking British officials. Drawn into a labyrinthine network of intrigue, he must attempt one of the most daring escapes ever conceived. In another masterful achievement in suspense, police lieutenant Claude LaPointe must solve a grotesque murder as he undertakes a strange journey through The Main, Montreal&#39;s dangerous immigrant district. In Shibumi, Nicholai Hel uses his nearly superhuman mental and physical prowess to destroy political terrorists. His wild series of globe-spanning adventures demonstrates why he is considered the world&#39;s most dangerous man. Rich and thoroughly entertaining, these four superbly written novels prove Trevanian to be one of the most compelling writers of suspense today.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art: N.C.

To view these color images of an era we are accustomed to seeing in sepia tones is an experience of cultural shock -- a trip in a visual time machine to a vanished and exotic world that looks as though it had been captured by the photographer only yesterday. Prokudin-Gorskii, a chemist as well as a photographer, developed one of the earliest processes for taking color pictures and was the editor for many years of a St. Petersburg journal, The Amateur Photographer. During the six years he executed the Tsar&#39;s commission, he traveled vast distances in a special railway car outfitted with a darkroom -- to the Urals, the Caucasus, the Ukraine, Siberia, Finland, and as far east as Turkestan. Eminent in his own country, he became one of the countless emigres to flee Russia in 1918, disappearing into relative obscurity in Norway, and later in England and France. Like imperial society, he too was a victim of the upheaval of the Revolution. Prokudin-Gorskii managed to bring out of Russia his collection of nearly 2000 glass-plate negatives. This book, produced with the cooperation of the Library of Congress, contains 120 of his finest color photographs -- including the only extant photo in color of Leo Tolstoy. Another 120 have been reproduced in sepia from black-and-white prints. Photographs for the Tsar is a landmark, destined to become a classic in its field.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Curse of the Black Hole Pirates #2 (Star Wars: The Clone Wars)</h2><p>The adventures of young Jedi Nuru Kungurama and the newly formed Breakout Squad continue as they take an unexpected and very dangerous detour and find themselves overwhelmed by space pirates.

Reprint.</p><p>Fans often feel uneasy when the creator of a popular character ventures into new turf, and sometimes their trepidation is justified. But readers of Robert B. Parker's immensely popular Spenser series can breathe a sigh of relief: while <i>Night Passage</i> doesn't feature Spenser, his usual gang of associates, or a Boston setting, it's vintage Parker--fast, witty, suspenseful, and engaging. Told in short, crisp chapters, it's the story of Jesse Stone, a 34-year-old ex-cop who just lost his L.A. policeman's job and his marriage due to a drinking problem. The book opens as Stone leaves California for his new job as chief of police in the picturesque town of Paradise, Massachusetts. <p> But Paradise isn't as placid as it seems--in fact, it's a festering mass of petty corruption, right-wing militia, sexual scandal, and bad guys who favor strong-arm tactics. <i>Night Passage</i> boasts a delicious, classic setup: the lone lawman, new in town, must make his stand to clean the place up. Stone has been picked for the job because the town fathers figured he'd be weak and malleable; as he gradually pulls himself together, it turns out they have a surprise in store. Stone's qualities may remind you of Spenser's--he's taciturn, fearless, good-looking, and compassionate--and in the end the plot's pleasing complexities get resolved a bit simply. But Robert B. Parker is in fine form in <i>Night Passage,</i> with his smart-aleck wit under control and his prose at its economical best. Spenser fans and Parker neophytes alike will find plenty to enjoy here. And the setting is, after all, not far from Boston--dare we hope for a Spenser-Stone meeting in future books?</p>The author of two dozen Spenser novels as well as numerous other works of fiction, Robert B. Parker is no stranger to either critical or popular acclaim. With his hallmark sharp wit and taut action, Parker has created in the Spenser series the standard against which all contemporary detective novels are measured, and a character considered the paragon of private eyes. In <i>Night Passage,</i> Parker sets the bar even higher, with the introduction of Jesse Stone, a hero cut from different cloth.<br><br>After a busted marriage kicks his drinking problem into overdrive and the LAPD unceremoniously dumps him, the thirty-five-year-old Stone's future looks bleak. So he's shocked when a small Massachusetts town called Paradise recruits him as police chief. He can't help wondering if this job is a genuine chance to start over, the kind of offer he can't refuse.<br><br>Once on board, Jesse doesn't have to look for trouble in Paradise: it comes to him. For what is on the surface a quiet New England community quickly proves to be a crucible of political and moral corruption--replete with triple homicide, tight Boston mob ties, flamboyantly errant spouses, maddened militiamen and a psychopath-about-town who has fixed his violent sights on the new lawman. Against all this, Jesse stands utterly alone, with no one to trust; even he and the woman he's seeing are like ships that pass in the night. He finds he must test his mettle and powers of command to emerge a local hero--or the deadest of dupes.<br><br>As the flagship volume in a new series featuring a complex and engaging sleuth, <i>Night Passage</i> is cause for celebration.</p><h2>Hitler 1936 To 1945 Nemesis</h2><p>Winner of the Wolfson Prize for History, Ian Kershaw's Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis is the concluding second volume of one of the greatest biographies of modern times. No figure in twentieth century history more clearly demands a close biographical understanding than Adolf Hitler; and no period is more important than the Second World War. Beginning with Hitler's startling European successes in the aftermath of the Rhineland occupation, from Czechoslovakia to Poland; addressing crucial questions about the unique nature of Nazi radicalism; exploring the Holocaust and the poisoned European world that allowed Hitler to operate so effectively; and ending nine years later with the suicide in the Berlin bunker, Kershaw allows us as never before to understand Hitler's motivation and impact.

Whitehead goes all-in with a <em>Rocky IV</em>-worthy regimen, hiring a personal trainer to prepare himself for the long, grueling table hours and a tournament-hardened coach to navigate the mysteries of Texas Hold&#x2019;em. When he arrives at the tournament, he navigates using a set of laws essential to any aspiring card sharp: which casino restaurants provide poker-appropriate nutrition; how to hit the bathrooms ahead of the mad rushes of the game breaks; and, of course, the necromancy of a successful Hold&#x2019;em hand. With its cast of poker-universe luminaries and aspiring misfits, the tournament stuff is fun, especially to this gambling rube. But Vegas is Vegas, and between the notes of the <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> slot machines, one can hear the suck of entropy. Whitehead--whose previous books landed him on the short-list for the Pulitzer, as well as a MacArthur "Genius" grant--has the wry sense of humor to observe the twisted reality of the &#x201c;Leisure Industrial Complex&#x201d; without mocking it; he&#x2019;s the kind of writer who can see the human condition reflected in the windows of a failed Vegas market that sells only beef jerky (and other jerky-like products).

Symptoms of decline are all around us today: slowing growth, crushing debts, increasing inequality, aging populations, antisocial behavior. But what exactly has gone wrong? The answer, Niall Ferguson argues in <i>The Great Degeneration</i>, is that our institutions&#x2014;the intricate frameworks within which a society can flourish or fail&#x2014;are degenerating.<br><br>Representative government, the free market, the rule of law, and civil society&#x2014;these are the four pillars of West European and North American societies. It was these institutions, rather than any geographical or climatic advantages, that set the West on the path to global dominance beginning around 1500. In our time, however, these institutions have deteriorated in disturbing ways. Our democracies have broken the contract between the generations by heaping IOUs on our children and grandchildren. Our markets are hindered by overcomplex regulations that debilitate the political and economic processes they were created to support; the rule of law has become the rule of lawyers. And civil society has degenerated into uncivil society, where we lazily expect all of our problems to be solved by the state.<br><br>It is institutional degeneration, in other words, that lies behind economic stagnation and the geopolitical decline that comes with it. With characteristic verve and historical insight, Ferguson analyzes not only the causes of this stagnation but also its profound consequences. <br><br><i>The Great Degeneration </i>is an incisive indictment of an era of negligence and complacency. While the Arab world struggles to adopt democracy and China struggles to move from economic liberalization to the rule of law, our society is squandering the institutional inheritance of centuries. To arrest the breakdown of our civilization, Ferguson warns, will take heroic leadership and radical reform.</p><p>NIALL FERGUSON is one of the world&#x2019;s most renowned historians.

He is also a regular contributor to <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Bloomberg</i> television.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost a quarter of a century ago, in the summer of 1989, Francis Fukuyama could boldly predict &#x2018;an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Triumph of the West&#x2019; and proclaim that &#x2018;the end point of mankind&#x2019;s ideological evolution&#x2019; was &#x2018;the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government&#x2019;.1 How different the world looks now. &#x2018;Economic liberalism&#x2019; is a tarnished brand, while the proponents of &#x2018;state capitalism&#x2019; in China and elsewhere openly deride Western democracy. The West is stagnating, and not only in economic terms. In 2013 the World Bank expected the European economy to contract and the US to grow by just 1.6 per cent. China would grow four times faster than that, India two and a half times faster. By 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund, the gross domestic product of China would approach that of the United States.* Those who invested in the West in 1989 have been punished (they have made nothing since 2000), while those who invested in the Rest have been richly rewarded. This &#x2018;great reconvergence&#x2019; is a far more astonishing historical event than the collapse of communism that Fukuyama so astutely anticipated. At the time he wrote, the world&#x2019;s centre of economic gravity was still firmly in the North Atlantic. Today it is beyond the Urals, and by 2025 it will be just north of Kazakhstan&nbsp;&#x2013; on roughly the same line of latitude as it was in 1500, on the eve of Western ascendancy.2</p><p>The voguish explanation for the Western slowdown is &#x2018;deleveraging&#x2019;: the painful process of debt reduction (or balance sheet repair). Certainly, there are few precedents for the scale of debt in the West today. This is only the second time in American history that combined public and private debt has exceeded 250 per cent of GDP. In a survey of fifty countries, the McKinsey Global Institute identifies forty-five episodes of deleveraging since 1930. In only eight was the initial debt/GDP ratio above 250 per cent, as it is today not only in the US but also in all the major English-speaking countries (including Australia and Canada), all the major continental European countries (including Germany), plus Japan and South Korea.3 The deleveraging argument is that households and banks are struggling to reduce their debts, having gambled foolishly on ever rising property prices. But as people have sought to spend less and save more, aggregate demand has slumped. To prevent this process from generating a lethal debt deflation, governments and central banks have stepped in with fiscal and monetary stimulus unparalleled in time of peace. Public sector deficits have helped to mitigate the contraction, but they risk transforming a crisis of excess private debt into a crisis of excess public debt. In the same way, the expansion of central bank balance sheets (the monetary base) prevented a cascade of bank failures, but now appears to have diminishing returns in terms of reflation and growth.</p><p>Yet more is going on here than just deleveraging. Consider this: the US economy created 2.4 million jobs in the three years beginning in June 2009. In the same period, 3.3 million Americans were awarded disabled worker benefits. The percentage of working-age Americans collecting disability insurance has risen from below 3 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent.4 Unemployment is being concealed &#x2013; and rendered permanent&nbsp;&#x2013; in ways all too familiar to Europeans. Able-bodied people are classified as disabled and never work again. And they also stay put. Traditionally around 3 per cent of the US population moves to a new state each year, usually in pursuit of work. That rate has halved since the financial crisis began in 2007. Social mobility has also declined. And, unlike the Great Depression of the 1930s, our &#x2018;Slight Depression&#x2019; is doing little to reduce the yawning inequality in income distribution that has developed over the past three decades. The income share of the top 1 per cent of households rose from 9 per cent in 1970 to 24 per cent in 2007. It declined by less than 4 percentage points in the subsequent three years of crisis.</p><p>You cannot blame all this on deleveraging. In the United States, the wider debate is about globalization, technological change, education and fiscal policy. Conservatives tend to emphasize the first and second as inexorable drivers of change, destroying low-skilled jobs by &#x2018;offshoring&#x2019; or automating them. Liberals prefer to see widening inequality as the result of insufficient investment in public education, combined with Republican reductions in taxation that have favoured the wealthy.5 But there is good reason to think that there are other forces at work&nbsp;&#x2013; forces that tend to get overlooked in the slanging match that passes for political debate in the United States today.</p><p>The crisis of public finance is not uniquely American. Japan, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal are also members of the club of countries with public debts in excess of 100 per cent of GDP. India had an even larger cyclically adjusted deficit than the United States in 2010, while Japan faced a bigger challenge to stabilize its debt/GDP ratio at a sustainable level.6 Nor are the twin problems of slow growth and widening inequality confined to the United States. Throughout the English-speaking world, the income share of the top &#x2018;1 per cent&#x2019; of households has risen since around 1980. The same thing has happened, albeit to a lesser extent, in some European states, notably Finland, Norway and Portugal, as well as in many emerging markets, including China.7 Already in 2010 there were at least 800,000 dollar millionaires in China and sixty-five billionaires. Of the global &#x2018;1 per cent&#x2019; in 2010, 1.6 million were Chinese, approaching 4 per cent of the total.8 Yet other countries, including Europe&#x2019;s most successful economy, Germany, have not become more unequal, while some less developed countries, notably Argentina, have become less equal without becoming more global.</p><p>By definition, globalization has affected all countries to some degree. So, too, has the revolution in information technology. Yet the outcomes in terms of growth and distribution vary hugely. To explain these differences, a narrowly economic approach is not sufficient. Take the case of excessive debt or leverage. Any highly indebted economy confronts a narrow range of options. There are essentially three:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;raising the rate of growth above the rate of interest thanks to technological innovation and (perhaps) a judicious use of monetary stimulus;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;defaulting on a large proportion of the public debt and going into bankruptcy to escape the private debt; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;wiping out of debts via currency depreciation and inflation.<p>But nothing in mainstream economic theory can predict which of these three&nbsp;&#x2013; or which combination&nbsp;&#x2013; a particular country will select. Why did post-1918 Germany go down the road of hyperinflation? Why did post-1929 America go down the road of private default and bankruptcy? Why not the other way round? At the time of writing, it seems less and less likely that any major developed economy will be able to inflate away its liabilities as happened in many cases in the 1920s and 1950s.9 But why not? Milton Friedman&#x2019;s famous dictum that inflation is &#x2018;always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon&#x2019; leaves unanswered the questions of who creates the excess money and why they do it. In practice, inflation is primarily a <i>political</i> phenomenon. Its likelihood is a function of factors like the content of elite education; competition (or the lack of it) in an economy; the character of the legal system; levels of violence; and the political decision-making process itself. Only by historical methods can we explain why, over the past thirty years, so many countries created forms of debt that, by design, cannot be inflated away; and why, as a result, the next generation will be saddled for life with liabilities incurred by their parents and grandparents.</p><p>In the same way, it is easy to explain why the financial crisis was caused by excessively large and leveraged financial institutions, but much harder to explain why, after more than four years of debate, the problem of &#x2018;too big to fail&#x2019; banks has not been solved. Indeed, despite the passage of legislation covering literally thousands of pages, it has got markedly worse.10 Today, a mere ten highly diversified financial institutions are responsible for three-quarters of total financial assets under management in the United States. Yet the country&#x2019;s largest banks are at least $50 billion short of meeting new capital requirements under the new &#x2018;Basel III&#x2019; accords governing bank capital adequacy. Again, only a political and historical approach can explain why Western politicians today call simultaneously for banks to lend more money and for them to shrink their balance sheets.</p><p>Why is it now a hundred times more expensive to bring a new medicine to market than it was sixty years ago&nbsp;&#x2013; a phenomenon Juan Enriquez has called &#x2018;Moore&#x2019;s Law* in reverse&#x2019;? Why would the Food and Drug Administration probably prohibit the sale of table salt if it were put forward as a new pharmacological product (it is after all toxic in large doses)?11 Why, to give another suggestive example, did it take an American journalist sixty-five days to get official permission (including, after a wait of up to five weeks, a Food Protection Certificate) to open a lemonade stand in New York City?12 This is the kind of debilitating red tape that development economists often blame for poverty in Africa or Latin America. The rationale for the FDA&#x2019;s rigid standards is to avoid the sale of a drug like thalidomide. But the unintended consequence is almost certainly to allow many more people to die prematurely than would have died from side-effects under a less restrictive regime. We count and recount the costs of such side-effects. We do not count the costs of not allowing new drugs to be made available.</p><p>Why exactly has social mobility declined in the United States in the past thirty years, so that the probability has more than halved that a man born into the bottom 25 per cent of the income distribution will end his life in the top quartile?13 Once the United States was famed as a land of opportunity, where a family could leap from &#x2018;rags to riches&#x2019; in a generation. But today, if you are born to parents in the bottom income quintile, you have just a 5 per cent chance of getting into the top quintile without a college degree. What Charles Murray has called the &#x2018;cognitive elite&#x2019;, educated at exclusive private universities, intermarried and congregated in a few &#x2018;super zip codes&#x2019;, looks increasingly like a new caste, equipped with the wealth and power to override the effects of mean reversion in human reproduction, so that even their dimmer progeny inherit their lifestyle.14</p><p>The Stationary State</p><p>In two seldom quoted passages of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Adam Smith described what he called &#x2018;the stationary state&#x2019;: the condition of a formerly wealthy country that had ceased to grow. What were the characteristics of this state? Significantly, Smith singled out its socially regressive character. First, wages for the majority of people were miserably low:</p><p>Though the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has been long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high in it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is in reality the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the society. The stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.15</p><p>The second hallmark of the stationary state was the ability of a corrupt and monopolistic elite to exploit the system of law and administration to their own advantage:</p><p>In a country too, where, though the rich or the owners of large capitals enjoy a good deal of security, the poor or the owners of small capitals enjoy scarce any, but are liable, under the pretence of justice, to be pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarins, the quantity of stock employed in all the different branches of business transacted within it can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that business might admit. In every different branch, the oppression of the poor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by engrossing the whole trade to themselves, will be able to make very large profits.16</p><p>I defy the Western reader not to feel an uneasy sense of recognition in contemplating those two passages.</p><p>In Smith&#x2019;s day, of course, it was China that had been &#x2018;long stationary&#x2019;: a once &#x2018;opulent&#x2019; country that had simply ceased to grow. Smith blamed China&#x2019;s defective &#x2018;laws and institutions&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2013; including its bureaucracy&nbsp;&#x2013; for the stasis. More free trade, more encouragement for small business, less bureaucracy and less crony capitalism: these were Smith&#x2019;s prescriptions to cure Chinese stasis. He was a witness to what such reforms were doing in the late eighteenth century to galvanize the economy of the British Isles and its American colonies. Today, by contrast, if Smith could revisit those same places, he would behold an extraordinary reversal of fortunes. It is we Westerners who are in the stationary state, while China is growing faster than any other major economy in the world. The boot of economic history is on the other foot.</p><p>This book is about the causes of our stationary state. It is inspired by Smith&#x2019;s insight that both stagnation and growth are in large measure the results of &#x2018;laws and institutions&#x2019;. Its central thesis is that what was true of China in Smith&#x2019;s day is true of large parts of the Western world in our time. It is our laws and institutions that are the problem. The Great Recession is merely a symptom of a more profound Great Degeneration.</p><p>The Four Black Boxes</p><p>To demonstrate that Western institutions have indeed degenerated, I am going to have to open up some long-sealed black boxes. The first is the one labelled &#x2018;democracy&#x2019;. The second is labelled &#x2018;capitalism&#x2019;. The third is &#x2018;the rule of law&#x2019;. And the fourth is &#x2018;civil society&#x2019;. Together, they are the key components of our civilization. I want to show that inside these political, economic, legal and social black boxes are highly complex sets of interlocking institutions. Like the circuit boards inside your computer or your smartphone, it is these institutions that make the gadget work. And if it stops working, it is probably because of a defect in the institutional wiring. You cannot understand what is wrong just by looking at the shiny casing. You need to look inside.</p><p>Perhaps, on reflection, that electronic metaphor is the wrong one. After all, most institutions evolve organically; they are not designed in California by the historical equivalent of Steve Jobs. A better analogy might be with the collective structures we see in the natural world. Beehives are the classic example.

Some series readers have complained of endlessly recycled or rejiggered recipes; others take each book at face value, finding the formulas and cooking insights good and helpful. America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook, which calls itself a cookbook, cooking school, and kitchen reference in one, offers over 1,200 approachable recipes for a very wide range of dishes--from "weekday" fare like Creamy Rice Casserole, Cheesy Nachos with Spicy Beef, and Skillet Lasagna, to dressier recipes, including Pan-Seared Lamb Chops with Red Wine Rosemary Sauce, Roasted Trout Stuffed with Bacon and Spinach, and Chocolate Marshmallow Mousse. There are "specialty" chapters devoted to sandwiches, drinks, and slow cooker and pressure cooker dishes; a grilling section is a tutorial in itself. <p> Unorthodox, "better-way" approaches abound. For example, a fried chicken formula instructs the cook to wet the bird's dry coating slightly before it's applied for an extra-crunchy crust. Predictably, side bars feature equipment and ingredient evaluations, on bottled salsa, for example; "good food/bad food" photographs show readers what to aim for when producing fare like holiday cookies; and there are tips, charts, and "Cooking 101" sidebars galore. Step-by-step photos offer more direction still. </p><p> Though the majority of recipes are sound and yield tempting results, readers poring through the book will note gaffes and curiosities. The recipe for poached eggs, for example, offers the option of extra cooking for "firm yolks" (hard-boiled poached eggs, anyone?) and hamburgers receive an indentation before cooking to avoid "puffy" domed burgers, a novel problem that could, in any case, be solved by proper shaping. The addition of sugar to some savory dishes--for example, a pan sauce for steak--is misguided. Readers should also know that the book, which comes in loose-leaf form, requires some assembly, and that the pages themselves are quite thin, making them vulnerable to spills and tearing in daily kitchen use. </p><p> These things said, the book delivers solid, family-friendly dishes with enough fully orchestrated "how- to" to make even novice cooks feel secure when tackling the basics or more ambitious fare. </p><p> <b>What's New in the Revised Editon?</b><br> First out in 2005, <i>America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook</i> was praised for its recipe ease, inclusiveness, and wealth of helpful information, but was also criticized for its physical production. A loose-leaf book with its pages included separately, readers found it inconvenient to assemble and its paper impractically thin. The revised edition is printed on heavier stock, and arrives with its pages already on its rings (there are two more now, for sturdiness) with only chapter dividers to insert, a simple task. </p><p> In addition, new inside front and back covers provide information on emergency substitutions, roasting guidelines, equivalent measures, and more--and a "Light Recipes" chapter has been included. Without defining precisely what "light" means--fewer fats and carbs, or a combo?--the section offers attractive all-course recipes, such as turkey chili, veggie burgers, meat and cheese lasagna, and chocolate bundt cake. Some readers will welcome the "slimming" of familiar dishes while others will find some of the manipulations--using cornstarch to thicken the sauce in fettuccine alfredo or ricotta to add body to a reduced-fat pesto, for example--unappealing. The book, however, remains a valuable kitchen tool--and one with greater convenience and durability than before. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i> </p> <br> <p><b>Exclusive Recipe Excerpts from <i>The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook (Revised Edition)</i></b> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br>Butternut Squash Soup </p></td> <td><br>Light Chicken Parmesan </td> <td><br>Classic Apple Pie</td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p> <b>More from America's Test Kitchen</b> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <p><br> <i>The Best of America's Test Kitchen 2007</i> </p> </td> <td><br> <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> </td><td><br> <i>The Best 30-Minute Recipe</i> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>The America's Test Kitchen Guarantee: Recipes that work . . . the first time and every time. <p>We know how frustrating it can be when things go wrong in the kitchen.

Yet after losing everything, Job&#x2014;though confused, angry, and questioning God&#x2014;refuses to reject his faith, although he challenges some central aspects of it. Rabbi Harold S. Kushner examines the questions raised by Job&#x2019;s experience, questions that have challenged wisdom seekers and worshippers for centuries. What kind of God permits such bad things to happen to good people? Why does God test loyal followers? Can a truly good God be all-powerful? <br>&nbsp;<br>Rooted in the text, the critical tradition that surrounds it, and the author&#x2019;s own profoundly moral thinking, Kushner&#x2019;s study gives us the book of Job as a touchstone for our time.

The book of Job is a full-length argument about whether the misfortunes that befall ostensibly good people come to them from the hand of God. If we want to believe that ours is a moral world, the scene of justice and fairness, we need to confront the arguments presented in what is probably the most challenging book in the entire Bible: the book of Job.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Creators: A History of Heroes of the Imagination</h2><p>By piecing the lives of selected individuals into a grand mosaic, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Daniel J.

Boorstin brings his customary depth and range to this compelling book on Western art, taking on everything from European megaliths (Stonehenge, for example) to Benjamin Franklin's autobiography ("the first American addition to world literature"). Boorstin does not aim at being comprehensive--he much prefers to linger over certain "heroes of the imagination" as he surveys human accomplishment in the fields of architecture, music, painting, sculpting, and writing--yet <i>The Creators</i> certainly <i>feels</i> comprehensive, as Boorstin carefully places everything he describes within a grand tradition of aesthetic achievement. <p> Boorstin knows that good history demands good writing, and his prose makes this big book easy to absorb. "This is a story," he writes, "of how creators in all the arts have enlarged, embellished, fantasized, and filigreed our experience"--an apt description of the role art plays in our life and an equally apt description of the way Boorstin interprets it for readers. (<i>The Creators</i> also is the second volume of a trilogy that starts with <i>The Discoverers</i> and concludes with <i>The Seekers</i>, although none of these books requires any knowledge of the others.) <i>--John J. Miller</i></p><b>Daniel J. Boorstin</b> was the author of <i>The Americans</i>, a trilogy (<i>The Colonial Experience</i>; <i>The National Experience</i>, and <i>The Democratic Experience</i>) that won the Francis Parkman Prize, the Bancroft Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize.

He chronicled his early days of underwater adventure in The Silent World&#x2014;a memoir that was an instant, international bestseller upon its publication in 1954.

Little of it would have been possible without scuba gear, which Cousteau pioneered when, in World War II, he along with engineer Emile Gagnan, cocreated the Aqua-Lung, a twin-hose underwater breathing apparatus. With the Aqua-Lung, Cousteau and his crew were able to explore and film parts of the ocean depths that had never been seen before, resulting in such Oscar-winning movies as&nbsp;<i>The Silent World</i>.</p><h2>The Natural Testosterone Plan: For Sexual Health and Energy</h2><p>How to maintain optimum testosterone levels for the male body through the use of herbs, nutritional supplements, and diet <br><br>� Explains the phenomenon of andropause--male menopause--and how to deal with it <br><br>� Reveals scientific evidence of testosterone-blocking agents in the environment that alter men&#x2019;s essential chemistry as they age <br><br>� Presents safe, organic plant medicines that can restore optimum testosterone levels <br><br>� Contains the most up-to-date natural treatments for impotence, infertility, and prostate disease <br><br>The recognition of the middle-age stage in male development of andropause, which is comparable to women&#x2019;s menopause, is hampered by the lack of a clear understanding of the chemistry and physiology specific to aging men.

National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>The engaging memoirs of a physician whose professional life has revolved around pain--and who packs his personal story with solid information on how and why we experience pain and how we can manage it. Brand was born in 1914 in India, the son of English missionaries who practiced medicine in the hill country near Madras. Educated in England, he took a one-year course in medicine designed for overseas missionaries, and was caught up by the wonder of it. In 1946, Brand returned to India as a missionary surgeon and soon was performing reconstructive surgery at a leprosy sanitorium. Later, in 1965, he moved to the US to set up a rehabilitation program at a leprosy hospital in Louisiana. His work with lepers gave him a unique perspective on, and appreciation for, pain--he calls it the ``beloved enemy''-- and direct experience of the hazards of painlessness. Nerve damage in leprosy (and in various other disorders, such as diabetes) causes loss of the sensation of pain, putting its victims at risk of unknowingly incurring disfiguring and even deadly injuries. Brand (assisted here by Yancey, Where Is God When It Hurts?, etc.--not reviewed) selectively includes tales of his childhood in rural India, his student days in London during the Blitz, his work with lepers and other patients, and even his own personal encounters with pain, showing how these experience have shaped his outlook. His observation of different cultures' views of pain have convinced him that one's attitude toward pain largely determines how it's experienced--and that fear, anger, guilt, helplessness, and loneliness all intensify it. Brand's stated goal is to restore balance to how we think about pain, and he succeeds admirably. Valuable for its insight into pain; unforgettable for its glimpses into the lives of lepers. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This autobiography transmits a healthy respect for, and new understanding of, the body's most basic warning system: pain. Seattle surgeon Brand was born in India in 1914 to British missionary parents. His childhood gave him an Indian perspective on pain as one of life's unavoidable challenges. After attending medical school in England during WW II, he returned to India and discovered that insensitivity to pain in lepers, and also in people with nerve disorders, alcoholism and other conditions, put them in constant peril of injuries and wounds. Continuing his work at a Louisiana leprosarium, Brand also opened a foot clinic for diabetics and innovated simple procedures that, if widely adopted, could eliminate thousands of unnecessary amputations in diabetics diagnosed with "nonhealing" foot ulcers. Brand, who collaborated with coauthor Yancey on Fearfully and Wonderfully Made , offers practical, wise advice on coping with, and learning from, physical pain as well as grief or emotional trauma. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All Things Wise and Wonderful</h2><p>The Yorkshire veterinarian&#39;s sequel to All Things Bright and Beautiful focuses on his induction into the RAF during World War II, his trips back to Yorkshire, and his recollections of animals that he has cared for and people who have enriched his life</p><p>Joy, suspense, delight, heartbreak, and-most especially-love. . . from the author of <i>All Creatures Great And Small</i> and <i>All Things Bright And Beautiful</i> the continuing love story of a Yorkshire vet and his friends and neighbors--human and animal. . .by the world's most beloved writer!

LC number unavailable. A-- Mother-daughter connections are explored by 48 black women writers in this volume of poetry, fiction, personal narratives, and essays. Framed within the quilt-making metaphor, these rich and varied voices strike equally rich and varied themes surrounding this relationship--the personal and cultural meanings, conflicts, nurturing, and the way they face separation and death. Newer writers join famous ones, such as Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Belle Hanks, and June Jordan. The strengths of Double Stitch lie in its concentrated focus and its honesty; the writings probe deeply, exposing both the tenderness and the turbulence in concrete ways. While the strong church-going matriarch is present, so is the less-than-perfect mother in conflict with the less-than-respectful daughter. Some mothers fail, escaping into alcoholism and other destructions. The selections have been organized to show that just as the quilting process can run in several directions at once, so can the mother-daughter relationship. Because this focus produces a driving intensity, YAs will prefer it to Mary Washington's more diffuse Memory of Kin: Stories about Family by Black Writers (Doubleday, 1991), which touches on all kinds of family units.

Here, for the delight of his many fans and friends, are twenty-one stories gleaned from the lifetime of glorious fishing - as true as can be expected of a fisherman. They cover the whole range of the trout fishing season, from The First Day ("Entire expedition got half shot and retired in vast disorder") to The Last Day ("Only eight more months to the magic first day"). There are hilarious stories that make one laugh out loud and stories that have an undercurrent of deep emotion. But each one carries that special kind of oblique humor and canniness that were John D. Voelker's special mark. And though this is no "how to" book, the author cannot help divulge in his stories some of the tricks of a lifetime of wily fishing.Here are a few of the stories: "The First Day," "Fish Car," "The Haunted Pond," "Trout Heaven," "The Old and the Proud," "The Old Fox," "Spots Before the Eyes," and "The Last Day."

How did a country that embraced freedom and market reform 25 years ago end up as an autocratic police state bent once again on confrontation with America? A winner of the Orwell Prize, The Invention of Russia reaches back to the darkest days of the cold war to tell the story of Russia's stealthy and largely unchronicled counter revolution.&nbsp;<br><br>A highly regarded Moscow correspondent for the Economist, Arkady Ostrovsky comes to this story both as a participant and a foreign correspondent. His knowledge of many of the key players allows him to explain the phenomenon of Valdimir Putin - his rise and astonishing longevity, his use of hybrid warfare and the alarming crescendo of his military interventions. One of Putin's first acts was to reverse Gorbachev's decision to end media censorship and Ostrovsky argues that the Russian media has done more to shape the fate of the country than its politicians. Putin pioneered a new form of demagogic populism --oblivious to facts and aggressively nationalistic - that has now been embraced by Donald Trump.</p><p><b>Arkady Ostrovsky</b>&nbsp;is a Russian-born journalist who has spent fifteen years reporting from Moscow, first for the <i>Financial Times</i> and then as bureau chief for <i>The Economist</i>. He studied Russian theater history in Moscow and holds a Ph.D. in English literature from Cambridge University. His translation of Tom Stoppard&#x2019;s trilogy <i>The Coast of Utopia</i> has been published and staged in Russia.&nbsp;He has appeared on morning edition, CNN, the BBC and Sky News. <i>The Invention of Russia</i> won the Orwell Prize and was a Financial Times Book of the Year.&#x201c;Anyone who has spent time in Russia over the past 30 years should be deeply grateful for Arkady Ostrovsky&#x2019;s fast-paced and excellently written book. Too often, the story of post-Soviet Russia is presented through a Western prism as a clash of good Westernizers and evil reactionaries, or as a lamentation about what the West could, and should, have done once it &#x201c;won&#x201d; the cold war. Mr. Ostrovsky doesn&#x2019;t waste time on that. A first class journalist who has spent many years covering Russia for <i>The Financial Times</i> and <i>The Economist</i>, he is also a native of the Soviet Union, with an instinctive understanding of how politics, ideas and daily life really work there.... For better or for worse, Mr. Putin has forced the world to reckon with a surly and combative Russia again.

He has reinvented and reinvigorated the myths of the superhero, of black-white relations, of New York City itself. &nbsp;But most of all, from my point of view, he captures precisely&#x2013;as only a great novelist can&#x2013;how it feels to love the world that is, on a daily basis, kicking your ass.&#x201d;<br>--Michael Chabon, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i> and <i>Wonder Boys<br><br></i><br>&#x201c;THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE is luminous, stinging with truth and life.

The fire created its own weather, including hurricane-strength winds, bubbles of plasma-like glowing gas, and 200-foot-tall flames. As temperatures reached 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, the firestorm knocked down buildings and carried flaming debris high into the sky. Two trains&#x2014;one with every single car on fire&#x2014;became the only means of escape. In all, more than four hundred people would die, leading to a revolution in forestry management and the birth of federal agencies that monitor and fight wildfires.</p><p>A spellbinding account of danger, devastation, and courage, <em>Under a Flaming Sky</em> reveals the dramatic, minute-by-minute story of the tragedy and brings into focus the ordinary citizens whose lives it irrevocably marked.</p></p><p>On September 1, 1894 two forest fires converged on the town of Hinckley, Minnesota, trapping over two thousand people. Daniel James Brown recounts the events surrounding the fire in Under a Flaming Sky, the most gripping and comprehensive chronicle of how the dramatic story unfolded. Whereas Oregon's famous "Biscuit" fire in 2002 took more than a week to burn its first 350,000 acres, the Hinckley fire did the same amount of damage in only five hours. The fire created its own weather, including hurricane-strength winds, bubbles of plasma-like glowing gas, and 200-foot-tall flames. In some instances, "fire whirls," or tornadoes of fire, danced out from the main body of the fire, knocking down buildings and carrying flaming debris high into the sky. Temperatures reached 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit--the melting point of steel.<br>As the fire surrounded the town, two railroads became the only means of escape. Both trains ran the gauntlet of fire. One train caught on fire from one end to the other. A heroic young African-American porter ran up and down the length of the train, reassuring the passengers even as the flames tore at their clothes. On the other train, the engineer refused to back out of town until the last possible minute of escape. In all, more than four hundred people died, leading to a revolution in forestry management practices and the birth of federal agencies that monitor and fight wildfires today. <p> <br></p><p>Daniel James Brown is the author of <em>The Boys in the Boat</em> and <em>Under a Flaming Sky: The Great Hinckley Firestorm of 1894</em>.

His days of regularly investigating the crimes of Victorian London now some years behind him, he plans a trip to his uncle's estate, Somerset, in the expectation of a few calm weeks to write an important speech. When he arrives in the quiet village of Plumley, however, what greets him is a series of strange vandalisms upon the local shops: broken windows, minor thefts, threatening scrawls.</p><p>Only when a far more serious crime is committed does he begin to understand the great stakes of those events, and the complex and sinister mind that is wreaking fear and suspicion in Plumley. Now, with his protege, John Dallington, at his side, the race is on for Lenox to find the culprit before he strikes again. And this time his victim may be someone that Lenox loves.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Finch </b>is a graduate of Yale and Oxford. He is the author of the Charles Lenox mysteries, including<i> The Fleet Street Murders, The September Society, A Stranger in Mayfair, and A Burial at Sea. </i>His first novel, <i>A Beautiful Blue Death</i>, was nominated for an Agatha Award and was named one of Library Journal's Best Books of 2007, one of only five mystery novels on the list. He lives in Oxford, England.</p>From Chapter One: <br> <br>Lady Jane reached the bottom of the stairs. She was a pretty woman, in rather a plain way, dark-haired and at the moment pale, wearing a gray dress with a pink ribbon at the waist. Above all the impression she left on people was of goodness&#x2014;or perhaps that was the impression she left primarily on Lenox, because he knew her so well, and therefore knew that quality in her. For many long years they had been dear friends, living side by side on Hampden Lane; now, still to his great surprise, they were man and wife. They had married four years before. <p><br>Better still, to add to his great happiness and evergreen surprise, at long last they had received a blessing that made him stop and smile to himself at random moments throughout every day, as he just had in his study, a blessing that never failed to lift his spirits above the intransigent tedium of politics: a daughter, Sophie.</p> <p><br>She had been theirs for three months, and every day her personality developed in new, startling, wonderful directions. Almost every hour he snuck away from his work to glimpse her, sleeping or better yet awake. Granted, she didn&#x2019;t do much&#x2014;she was no great hand at arithmetic, as Lady Jane would joke, seldom said anything witty, would prove useless aboard a horse&#x2014;but he found even her minutest motions enchanting. Babies had always seemed much of a muchness to him, but how wrong he had been! When she wriggled an inch to the left he found himself holding his breath with excitement.</p> <p><br>After Jane had gone downstairs to arrange his lunch with the butler and the cook, Lenox remained in the hall, where he opened his letter. It was from his uncle Frederick, a relation of Lenox&#x2019;s late mother.</p> <p><br><i>Dear Charles,</i></p> <p><i><br>Please consider this a formal invitation to come down for a week or two, with Jane of course and the new Lenox; I very much want to meet her. The garden is in fine shape, and then, Fripp is very anxious to have you for the cricket, which takes place Saturday week. I haven&#x2019;t seen you in more than a year, you know.</i></p> <p><i>Yours with affection,<br>Frederick Ponsonby</i></p> <p><i><br>Postscript: To sweeten the pot, shall I mention that in town, recently, there have been a series of strange vandalisms? The police cannot make head or tail of them and so everyone is in great stir. Perhaps you might lend a hand.</i><br>Lenox smiled. He was fond of his uncle, an eccentric man, retiring and very devoted to his small, ancient country house, which lay just by a village. Since the age of four or five Lenox had gone there once a year, usually for a fortnight, though it was true that the stretches between visits had gotten longer more recently, as life had grown busier. Still, there was no way he could leave London just at this moment, with so many political matters hanging in the balance. He tucked the note into his jacket pocket and turned back to his study.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Charles Finch</p></p><h2>My Italian Bulldozer: A Paul Stuart Novel (1) (Paul Stuart Series)</h2><p>The best-selling author of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency series returns with an irresistible new novel about one man&#x2019;s adventures in the Italian countryside.<br><br>Paul Stuart, a renowned food writer, finds himself at loose ends after his longtime girlfriend leaves him for her personal trainer. To cheer him up, Paul&#x2019;s editor, Gloria, encourages him to finish his latest cookbook on-site in Tuscany, hoping that a change of scenery (plus the occasional truffled pasta and glass of red wine) will offer a cure for both heartache and writer&#x2019;s block. But upon Paul&#x2019;s arrival, things don&#x2019;t quite go as planned. A mishap with his rental-car reservation leaves him&nbsp;stranded, until a newfound friend leads him to an intriguing alternative: a bulldozer. <br><br>With little choice in the matter, Paul accepts the offer, and as he journeys (well, slowly trundles) into the idyllic hillside town of Montalcino, he discovers that the bulldozer may be the least of the surprises that await him. What follows is a delightful romp through the lush sights and flavors of the Tuscan countryside, as Paul encounters a rich cast of characters, including a young American woman who awakens in him something unexpected.<br><br>A feast for the senses and a poignant meditation on the complexity of human relationships, <i>My Italian Bulldozer</i> is a charming and intensely satisfying love story for anyone who has ever dreamed of a fresh start.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH&nbsp;</b>is the author of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency novels and a number of other series and stand-alone books. His works have been translated into more than forty languages and have been best sellers throughout the world. He lives in Scotland.<b>2</b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>THERE IS NO CAR</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Scotland fell away beneath him, a stretch of green pasture, of hills, of swirling mist. Suddenly they were bathed in sunlight; fields of cloud, topped with crenellations of white, now lay beneath them as their plane pointed south. In his window seat he closed his eyes against the glare, imagining for a few moments their destination, as much an idea, a feeling, as a place. He saw a small tower that he had never seen before, a tower of warm red brick with a pattern of holes for doves. Down below, a man was pulling at a bell rope; as the bell rang, the doves launched themselves from their holes in the brick and fluttered skywards.<br>&nbsp;<br>He opened his eyes and noticed that the passenger in the seat beside him, a man in perhaps his early fifties, dressed in a lightweight linen suit, was looking at him. The man smiled at him, and he returned the smile.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What takes you to Pisa?&#x201d; the man asked. His accent revealed him as Italian.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul hesitated, unsure as to whether he wanted to strike up a conversation that went beyond the niceties. He had brought with him a book that was just beginning to engage him, and he was looking forward to getting back to it. But the man smiled at him again, and his natural politeness decided the matter.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;So parlare Italiano,&#x201d; </i>he began. <i>&#x201c;Sono . . .&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The man did not allow him to finish. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; he said, and then, continuing in Italian, &#x201c;What a pleasure it is for us Italians to discover somebody who speaks our language.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there are many. Such a beautiful language . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but what use is a beautiful language spoken just by oneself? It&#x2019;s all very well for the Spaniards, because there are so many Spanish speakers&#x2014;all over the world. Even Portuguese has Brazil, but we have just us&#x2014;just Italy&#x2014;and after a while we get fed up with speaking only to ourselves. We have heard everything there is to say in Italian.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Surely not . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am not entirely serious. A bit serious, perhaps, but not entirely.&#x201d; Turning in his seat, he extended a hand towards Paul. &#x201c;But I must introduce myself. I am Rossi&#x2014;Silvio Rossi.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Paul Stuart.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio loosened his tie. &#x201c;Stuart is the name of Scottish kings, is it not? Mary Stuart . . .&#x201d; He made a chopping gesture across his throat. &#x201c;She was most unfortunate. Queens cannot choose their neighbours, and if they find they have one who has an axe, then it is most regrettable.&#x201d; He sighed, as if the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been a recent outrage.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was a long time ago,&#x201d; Paul said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;But I am an historian,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What happened in the past remains rather vivid for me and . . .&#x201d; He paused, and now removed the tie altogether. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Yes I find that the past has a much bigger shadow than people believe. It&#x2019;s still with us in so many ways. At our side all the time, whispering into our ear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Warning us not to repeat our mistakes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio smiled. &#x201c;We repeat some. Others we&#x2019;re sensible&nbsp;enough to avoid making more than once. But that&#x2019;s not what I was thinking about. What I was thinking about was the way in which the past determines our character, not just as individuals, but as nations. A child who is treated badly grows up damaged. A people who are subjected to bad treatment will bear resentments, will be suspicious. They will be bad allies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul, who had been holding his book, slipped it into the seat pocket in front of him. He had endured worse conversations on flights, including an attempt at religious conversion, a confession of adultery, and detailed advice on the attractions of Panama as a tax shelter. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio waved a hand airily. &#x201c;Oh, there are many examples. Russia, for one. Russia is a peasant country. It has a past of serfdom that ended only in the nineteenth century. That made for a vast, stubborn, ignorant population&#x2014;one that was also very resentful. And they are resentful today&#x2014;particularly of the West.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They view the West in the same light as they viewed their feudal masters. Authority.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;So western politicians who lecture Russians about human rights or their tendency to invade their neighbours will never change them. Not one bit. You&#x2019;re dealing with a particular sort of bear, you see. One with a history. An abused bear with a short temper.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul savoured the metaphor. He was right. &#x201c;And Italy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s an interesting case. With us, the important thing to remember is that we are very young. We have lots of history, of course, but Italy itself is a teenager. The Risorgimento was really just yesterday, you&#x2019;ll know. It ended in 1871. That&#x2019;s yesterday. And that means that, as a state, we are still very far from maturity. That&#x2019;s why half the population doesn&#x2019;t really believe that the Italian state exists&#x2014;or, if it&nbsp;does, they feel that they owe it nothing. We&#x2019;re very disloyal to Rome, you know. We look after ourselves&#x2014;our family, our city&#x2014;and we don&#x2019;t like paying taxes to Rome.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nobody likes taxes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Some like them less than others. Take the Greeks. They have a particular aversion to taxes, and this is because they haven&#x2019;t forgotten that they were once part of the Ottoman Empire and they saw no reason to pay taxes to the Ottomans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying that people don&#x2019;t change?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio sighed. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t. Or if they do, it takes a long time. A very long time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The plane gave a slight jolt as it encountered a pocket of turbulent air. Paul glanced out of the window, and then returned to the conversation. &#x201c;May I ask you something?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is this what you actually do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an economic historian,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s something quite different, but it doesn&#x2019;t stop me having views on these more general matters.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Economic history,&#x201d; muttered Paul.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A sobering science. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve been in Scotland. I&#x2019;ve been at a conference.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me why you&#x2019;re going to Pisa.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;To taste food and wine,&#x201d; said Paul.<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio looked surprised. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what you do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I write about it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is a great deal to be said about Italian food.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m discovering that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul reached for his book.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t keep you from your reading.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul had not intended to be rude. &#x201c;Forgive me. I was enjoying our conversation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you must read your book, and I have some papers to&nbsp;attend to.&#x201d; Silvio reached into his pocket. &#x201c;Let me give you my card. I&#x2019;m at the University of Pisa. It has all the details there. If you need help while you&#x2019;re in Italy, please get in touch with me. My door is always open.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul thanked him and took the card. Professor Silvio Rossi, it appeared, was not only Professor of Economic History at the University of Pisa, but a member of the Italian Academy of Economic Science and a <i>cavaliere </i>of the Republic. He slipped the card into the pocket of his jacket and opened his book.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Hostage Zero (A Jonathan Grave Thriller)</h2><p>Hostage rescue expert Jonathan Grave is used to working alone, and this time he&#39;ll have to go where even the government won&#39;t.

The addictively readable second thriller featuring freelance hostage rescue operative Jonathan "Digger" Grave (after 2009's No Mercy) marries a breakneck pace to a complex, multilayered plot. When two teenage boys are inexplicably kidnapped from a Virginia residential school for children of incarcerated parents, Grave and his crew set out to locate the victims and apprehend the abductors. Then one of the boys is drugged and left to die in a field, saved only by the fateful intervention of a passing homeless man, and Grave's investigation begins to turn up leads that point to government and organized crime connections. A roller-coaster ride of adrenaline-inducing plot twists leads to a riveting and highly satisfying conclusion. Exceptional characterization and an intricate, flawlessly crafted story line make this an absolute must read for thriller fans. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We tell them to stay alive or keep alive those who only live now in the telling. In Faha, County Clare, everyone is a long story... Bedbound in her attic room beneath the falling rain, in the margin between this world and the next, Plain Ruth Swain is in search of her father. To find him, enfolded in the mystery of ancestors, Ruthie must first trace the jutting jaw lines, narrow faces and gleamy skin of the Swains from the restless Reverend Swain, her great-grandfather, to grandfather Abraham, to her father, Virgil - via pole-vaulting, leaping salmon, poetry and the three thousand, nine hundred and fifty eight books piled high beneath the two skylights in her room, beneath the rain. The stories - of her golden twin brother Aeney, their closeness even as he slips away; of their dogged pursuit of the Swains&#39; Impossible Standard and forever falling just short; of the wild, rain-sodden history of fourteen acres of the worst farming land in Ireland - pour forth in Ruthie&#39;s still, small, strong, hopeful voice. A celebration of books, love and the healing power of the imagination, this is an exquisite, funny, moving novel in which every sentence sings.</p><p>Niall Williams was born in Dublin in 1958.

(Currents of Encounter, 41)</h2><p>The defining premise of the Relational Free Will Defense is the claim that authentic love requires free will. Many scholars, including Gregory Boyd and Vincent Br�mmer, champion this claim. Best-selling books, such as Rob Bell's <i>Love Wins</i>, echo that love "cannot be forced, manipulated, or coerced. It always leaves room for the other to decide." The claim that love requires free will has even found expression in mainstream Hollywood films, including <i>Frailty</i>,<i> Bruce Almighty</i>, and <i>The Adjustment Bureau</i>. The analysis shows convincingly that the claim that authentic love requires free will, does not meet the criteria of consistency, compatibility with Scriptural sources, and the demands of concrete encounter with problems of moral evil. The analytical rigor of his exposition, the way in which the argumentation has been structured to progressively sharpen and deepen the focus of the critique, the compelling clarity of his thought and the almost blistering style of his writing, his ingenious ability to invigorate the discussion with metaphor, thought experiments and examples from ordinary life, and his evident mastery of the relevant literature, are only some of the outstanding features of what can rightfully be described as a <i>tour de force</i>. Willie van der Merwe (VU University Amsterdam/Stellenbosch University) The manuscript provides a well written critical analysis of the Relational Free Will Defence and is a significant and original contribution to current scholarship in philosophical theology. Even those scholars who (like myself) do not agree with the author's preferred solutions, cannot merely dismiss his arguments, but will be necessitated to provide adequate counter arguments in order to uphold their alternative views. In this way the manuscript is a worthy contribution to the current debate. Even his opponents can learn much from his argument. Vincent Br�mmer (Utrecht University) Why another book on the problem of evil? Judging by the volume of scholarly and popular work on this subject in recent decades, this perennial and vexing human question remains very much on our hearts and minds. Every now and again, though, there are truly new treatments that move the ball down the field. This is such a volume. Simultaneously rigorous and sympathetic in its engagement with contemporary defenders of libertarian free will, Williams also contributes fresh insights of his own to a debate in which "nothing new under the sun" is often the rule. Especially among those of us who think they've already made up their minds on this question, <i>Love, Freedom and Evil </i>not only deserves but demands a serious reading and evaluation.

I got distracted, and all of a sudden I couldn&#x2019;t see my parents anymore. I was scared, but I immediately found the way home and got there before they did. They kept looking for me, desperate, but I thought that they were lost. That I knew how to get home and they didn&#x2019;t. <br>&#x201c;You went a different way,&#x201d; my mother said later, angry, her eyes still swollen. <br>You were the ones who went a different way, I thought, but I didn&#x2019;t say it. <br>Dad watched quietly from the armchair. Sometimes I think he spent all his time just sitting there, thinking. But maybe he didn&#x2019;t really think about anything. Maybe he just closed his eyes and received the present with calm or resignation. That night he spoke, though: &#x201c;This is a good thing,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;You overcame adversity.&#x201d; Mom looked at him suspiciously, but he went on stringing together a confused speech about adversity. <br>I lay back on the chair across from him and pretended to fall asleep. I heard them argue, always the same pattern. Mom would say five sentences and Dad would answer with a single word. Sometimes he would answer sharply: &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Sometimes he would say, practically shouting: &#x201c;Liar.&#x201d; Sometimes he would even say, like the police: &#x201c;Negative.&#x201d; <br>That night Mom carried me to bed and told me, perhaps knowing I was only pretending to sleep and was listening, curious and attentive: &#x201c;Your father is right. Now we know you won&#x2019;t get lost. That you know how to walk in the street alone. But you should concentrate more on the way. You should walk faster.&#x201d; <br>I listened to her. From then on, I walked faster. In fact, a couple of years later, the first time I talked to Claudia, she asked me why I walked so fast. She had been following me for days, spying on me. We had met not long before, on March 3, 1985&#x2014;the night of the earthquake&#x2014;but we hadn&#x2019;t talked then. <br>She was twelve and I was nine, so our friendship was impossible. But we were friends, or something like it. We talked a lot. Sometimes I think I&#x2019;m writing this book just to remember those conversations. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The night of the earthquake I was scared but I also, in a way, enjoyed what was happening. <br>In the front yard of one of the houses, the adults put up two tents for the children to sleep in, and at first it was chaos because we all wanted to sleep in the one that looked like an igloo&#x2014;those were still a novelty back then&#x2014;but they gave that one to the girls. So we boys shut ourselves in to fight in silence, which was what we did when we were alone: hit each other furiously, happily. But then the redhead&#x2019;s nose started bleeding, so we had to find another game. <br>Someone thought of making wills, and at first it seemed like a good idea; after a while, though, we decided it didn&#x2019;t make sense, because if a bigger earthquake came and ended the world, there wouldn&#x2019;t be anyone to leave our things to. Then we imagined that the earth was like a dog shaking itself so people fell off like fleas into space, and we thought about that image so much it made us laugh, and it also made us sleepy. <br>But I didn&#x2019;t want to sleep. I was tired like never before, but it was a new tiredness that burned my eyes. I decided to stay up all night and I tried to sneak into the igloo to keep talking to the girls, but the policeman&#x2019;s daughter threw me out, saying I wanted to rape them. Back then I didn&#x2019;t know what a rapist was but I still promised I didn&#x2019;t want to rape them, I just wanted to look at them, and she laughed mockingly and replied that that was what rapists always said. I had to stay outside, listening to them pretend that their dolls were the only survivors; they mourned their owners, crying spectacularly when they realized they were dead, although one of them thought it was for the best, since the human race had always seemed repellent to her. Finally, they argued over who would be in charge. The discussion seemed long to me, but it was easily resolved, since there was only one original Barbie among the dolls: she won. <br>I found a beach chair among the rubble and shyly approached the adults&#x2019; bonfire. It was strange to see the neighbors all gathered together, maybe for the first time ever. They drowned their fear in cups of wine and long looks of complicity. Someone brought an old wooden table and threw it casually on the fire. &#x201c;If you want, I&#x2019;ll throw the guitar on, too,&#x201d; said Dad, and everyone laughed, even me, though I was a little disconcerted because Dad didn&#x2019;t usually tell jokes. That&#x2019;s when our neighbor Ra�l returned, and Magali and Claudia were with him. &#x201c;These are my sister and my niece,&#x201d; he said. After the earthquake he had gone to look for them, and now he was coming back, visibly relieved. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Ra�l was the only person in the neighborhood who lived alone. It was hard for me to understand how someone could live alone. I thought that being alone was a kind of punishment or disease. <br>The morning he arrived with a mattress strapped to the roof of his old Fiat 500, I asked my mother when the rest of his family would come; she answered sweetly that not everyone had family. Then I thought we should help him, but after a while I caught on, surprised, that my parents weren&#x2019;t interested in helping Ra�l; they didn&#x2019;t think it was necessary and they even felt a certain reluctance toward that young, thin man. We were neighbors, we shared a wall and a privet hedge, but there was an enormous distance separating us. <br>It was said around the neighborhood that Ra�l was a Christian Democrat, and that struck me as interesting. It&#x2019;s hard to explain now why a nine-year-old boy would be interested that someone was a Christian Democrat. Maybe I thought there was some connection between being a Christian Democrat and the sad circumstance of living alone. I had never seen Dad speak to Ra�l, so I was surprised to see them sharing a few cigarettes that night. I thought they must be talking about solitude, that Dad was giving our neighbor advice about how to overcome solitude, though Dad must have known very little about the subject. <br>Magali, meanwhile, was holding Claudia tightly in a corner, away from the group. The two of them seemed uncomfortable. I remember thinking that they must have been uncomfortable because they were different from the rest of the people gathered there. Politely, but perhaps with a trace of malice, one neighbor asked Magali what she did for a living; Magali answered immediately, as if she&#x2019;d been expecting the question, that she was an English teacher. <br>It was very late and I was sent to bed. I had to reluctantly make space for myself in the tent. I was afraid I might fall asleep, but I distracted myself by listening to those stray voices in the night. I understood that Ra�l had taken his relatives home, because people started to talk about them. Someone said the girl was strange. She hadn&#x2019;t seemed strange to me. She had seemed beautiful. &#x201c;And the woman,&#x201d; said my mother, &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t have an English teacher&#x2019;s face.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She had the face of a housewife, nothing more,&#x201d; added another neighbor, and they drew out the joke for a while. <br>I thought about an English teacher&#x2019;s face, about what an English teacher&#x2019;s face should be like. I thought about my mother, my father. I thought: What kinds of faces do my parents have? But our parents never really have faces. We never learn to truly look at them. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I thought we would spend weeks or even months outside, waiting for some far-off truck to bring supplies and blankets. I even imagined myself talking on TV, thanking my fellow Chileans for their help, the way I&#x2019;d seen people do during the rainstorms. I thought about the terrible floods of other years, when we couldn&#x2019;t go out and we were practically obligated to sit in front of the screen and watch the people who had lost everything. <br>But it wasn&#x2019;t like that. Calm returned almost immediately. The worst always happened to other people. In that lost corner west of Santiago the earthquake had been no more than an enormous scare. A few shacks fell down, but there was no great damage and no one died. The TV showed the San Antonio port destroyed, as well as some streets I had seen or thought I had seen on rare trips to downtown Santiago. I confusedly intuited that the true suffering happened there. <br>If there was anything to learn, we didn&#x2019;t learn it. Now I think it&#x2019;s a good thing to lose confidence in the solidity of the ground, I think it&#x2019;s necessary to know that from one moment to the next everything can come tumbling down. But at the time we went back, just like that, to life as usual. <br>Once we were back in the house, Dad confirmed that the damage was slight: just some plaster fallen from the walls and a cracked window. Mom mourned only the loss of the zodiac glasses. Eight of them broke, including hers (Pisces), Dad&#x2019;s (Leo), and the one Grandma used when she came to see us (Scorpio). <br>&#x201c;No problem, we have other glasses, we don&#x2019;t need any more,&#x201d; said Dad, and she answered without looking at him, looking at me: &#x201c;Only yours survived.&#x201d; Then she went to get the glass with the Libra sign, and gave it to me with a solemn gesture. She spent the following days a little depressed, contemplating giving the remaining glasses to Geminis, Virgos, Aquarians. <br>The good news was that we wouldn&#x2019;t go back to school right away. The old building had suffered significant damage, and those who had seen it said it was a pile of rubble. It was hard for me to imagine the school destroyed, though it wasn&#x2019;t sadness that I felt. I just felt curious. I especially remembered the bare spot at the edge of the playground where we went at recess, and the wall the middle school kids would scribble on. I thought about all those messages smashed to smithereens, scattered in the ash on the ground&#x2014;bawdy sayings, phrases for or against Colo-Colo, or for or against Pinochet. One phrase I found especially funny: <i>Pinochet sucks dick.</i> <br>Back then I was, as I always have been, and I always will be, for Colo-Colo. As for Pinochet, to me he was a television personality who hosted a show with no fixed schedule, and I hated him for that, for the stuffy national channels that interrupted their programming during the best parts. Later I hated him for being a son of a bitch, for being a murderer, but back then I hated him only for those inconvenient shows that Dad watched without saying a word, without acceding any movement other than a more forceful drag on the cigarette he always had glued to his lips. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Around then, the redhead&#x2019;s father took a trip to Miami, and he returned with a baseball glove and bat for his son. The gift brought about an unexpected break in our routine. For many days we switched from soccer to that slow and slightly stupid game which nevertheless entranced my friends. It was absurd: ours must have been the only neighborhood in the country where the kids played baseball instead of soccer. It was hard for me to hit the ball or throw it straight and I was quickly sent to the bench. The redhead, who had been one of my best friends, suddenly became popular. Now he preferred the company of the older kids who were attracted by the foreign game and had joined our group. And that&#x2019;s how, because of baseball, I was left friendless. <br>In the afternoons, resigned to solitude, I would leave the house, as they say, to tire myself out: I walked in wider and wider circuits, though I almost always respected a certain geometry of circles. I exhausted all possible routes, all the blocks, took in new landscapes, though the world didn&#x2019;t vary too much: the same new houses, built quickly, as if obeying some urgency, but nevertheless solid and resilient. In a few weeks most of the walls had been restored and reinforced. It was hard to tell there had just been an earthquake. <br>Now I don&#x2019;t understand that freedom we enjoyed. We lived under a dictatorship; people talked about crimes and attacks, martial law and curfew, but even so, nothing kept me from spending all day wandering far from home. Weren&#x2019;t the streets of Maip� dangerous then? At night they were, and during the day as well, but the adults played, arrogantly or innocently&#x2014;or with a mixture of arrogance and innocence&#x2014;at ignoring the danger. They played at thinking that discontent was a thing of the poor and power the domain of the rich, and in those streets no one was poor or rich, at least not yet. <br>One of those afternoons I saw Ra�l&#x2019;s niece again, but I didn&#x2019;t know if I should say hello. I saw her again several times in the following days. I didn&#x2019;t realize that she was actually following me. <br>&#x201c;I just like to walk fast,&#x201d; I answered when she finally spoke to me, and then came a long silence that she broke by asking me if I was lost. I answered that no, I knew perfectly well how to get home. &#x201c;It was a joke, I want to talk to you, let&#x2019;s meet next Monday at five in the supermarket bakery.&#x201d; She said it like that, in one sentence, and left. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The next day my parents woke me up early because we were going to spend the weekend at Lo Ovalle Reservoir. Mom didn&#x2019;t want to go and she dragged out the preparations, confident that lunchtime would come and the plan would have to change. Dad decided, however, that we would have lunch at a restaurant, and we left right away. Back then, it was a real luxury to eat out. I sat in the backseat of the Peugeot thinking about what I would order, and in the end I asked for a steak <i>a lo pobre</i>. Dad warned me that it was a big dish and I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to eat it all, but on those rare outings I was free to order whatever I wanted. <br>Suddenly, that heavy atmosphere prevailed in which the only possible topic of conversation is the lateness of the food. Our order took so long that finally Dad decided we would leave as soon as the food came. I protested, or I wanted to protest, or now I think I should have protested. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to leave, let&#x2019;s go now,&#x201d; said Mom resignedly, but Dad explained that this way the restaurant owners would lose the food, that it was an act of justice, of revenge. <br>We continued our journey ill-humored and hungry. I didn&#x2019;t really like going to the reservoir. They wouldn&#x2019;t let me wander very far by myself and I got bored, though I tried to have fun swimming for a while, fleeing from the rats that lived among the rocks, looking at the worms eating the sawdust and the fish dying on land. Dad settled in to fish all day, and Mom spent the day watching him, and I watched Dad fish and Mom watch him and it was hard for me to understand how that was, for them, fun. <br>Sunday morning I faked a cold because I wanted to sleep a little longer. They went off to the rocks after giving me endless superfluous instructions. A little while later, I got up and turned on the tape player so I could listen to Raphael while I made breakfast. It was a cassette of all his best songs that my mother had recorded from the radio. Unfortunately, my finger slipped and I pressed &#x201c;REC&#x201d; for a few seconds. I ruined the tape right in the chorus of the song &#x201c;Que sabe nadie.&#x201d; <br>I was desperate. After thinking a bit, I decided the only solution was to sing over the chorus, and I started practicing the lyric, disguising my voice in a way that seemed convincing to me. Finally I decided to record. I listened to the results several times, thinking, somewhat self-indulgently, that it was good enough. I was a little worried, though, about the lack of music during those seconds. <br>My father would yell at me, but he didn&#x2019;t hit. He never hit me, it wasn&#x2019;t his style; he preferred the grandiloquence of phrases that were impressive at first, because he said them seriously, like an acto...</p><h2>I Want a Pony (Pony Pals #1)</h2><p>An early chapter book series featuring a group of young girls and their ponies.</p><p></p><h2>The Old Woman Who Named Things</h2><p>How does an old woman who has outlived all her friends keep from being lonely? By naming the things in her life she knows she will never outlive--like her house, Franklin, and her bed, Roxanne. When a shy brown puppy appears at her front gate, the old woman won&#x2019;t name it, because it might not outlive her. Tender watercolors capture the charm of this heartwarming story of an old woman who doesn&#x2019;t know she&#x2019;s lonely until she meets a plucky puppy who needs a name--and someone to love. &#x201c;Rylant and Brown together create with affection and lovingly humorous touches a glimpse of old age lived with relish.&#x201d;--<i>Booklist</i><br></p><p><b>Cynthia Rylant</b>&nbsp;is a Newbery medalist and the&nbsp;author of many acclaimed books for young people.

She lives in the Pacific Northwest. www.cynthiarylant.com.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten-Grade 3?Having outlived all of her friends, an inventive elderly woman intends to outsmart loneliness by naming the significant inanimate objects in her life. Confident that she will never outlive any of them, she resides complacently with a sturdy armchair named Fred and a firm bed named Roxanne inside a well-built house named Franklin. One day, a stray brown puppy appears. She hesitantly offers scraps of food but no commitment of friendship. After a few months time, the persevering puppy grows up to be a shy brown dog, but the woman does not acquiesce. However, one day when the dog does not appear, she is filled with concern. After a valiant attempt to locate it on her own, she enlists the help of the local dogcatcher. The old woman then makes a quick but firm decision to provide the dog with a name, acknowledging his place in her affections. Oddly enough, she remains nameless throughout the story. Themes of resilience and acceptance help make the narrative meaningful. Brown's watercolor illustrations show the independent woman in her cozy, somewhat cluttered surroundings, and the engaging pup who is sure to win readers' hearts as he does hers. Although the premise of the story may be a bit sophisticated for younger children, the happy resolution is most satisfying.

John Waters is putting his life on the line. Armed with wit, a pencil-thin mustache, and a cardboard sign that reads &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Not Psycho,&#x201d; he hitchhikes across America from Baltimore to San Francisco, braving lonely roads and treacherous drivers. But who should we be more worried about, the delicate film director with genteel manners or the unsuspecting travelers transporting the Pope of Trash?</p><p><p><b>John Waters </b>is an American filmmaker, actor, writer, and visual artist best known for his cult films, including <i>Hairspray</i>, <i>Pink Flamingos</i>, and <i>Cecil B. DeMented. </i>He is also the author of a memoir, <i>Role Models</i>. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>GOOD RIDE NUMBER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>HARRIS</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a beautiful Baltimore spring day&#x2014;the perfect 68o morning. I decide to leave twenty-four hours earlier than everyone in my office thinks I will, so I can avoid all their nervous goodbyes. Susan, my longtime assistant who runs my filth empire with an iron fist, has always thought this adventure a ludicrous idea but knows I am just as stubborn as she can be, so she long ago gave up on talking me out of it. Trish, my other full-time assistant, who will actually be transcribing this book (I write by hand on legal pads before she puts it on the computer), is a little friendlier to the idea since she was briefly a teenage runaway. Jill, my art helper, seems all for the idea. My bookkeeper, Doralee, has given up being surprised by anything that goes on in our office but knows I will continue to get a receipt for every single penny I spend while hitching, since no one could argue this is not a business trip. Margarett, my housekeeper, laughed the hardest I&#x2019;ve ever heard her (practically in my face) when I confessed my cross-country plans.</p> <p>Just before I walk out the front door to leave, I look out back and see the fox that lives on my property happily roaming my wooded grounds and take this as a good-luck sign. I turn on the burglar alarm and leave feeling&nbsp;&#x2026; well, adventurous. I walk up my small residential street and am relieved that none of my neighbors see me carrying a hitchhiking sign or question why I am on foot carrying an obvious travel bag. I get to the corner of Charles Street and stick out my thumb and hold up my I-70 WEST cardboard sign that Jill designed for me. &#x201c;Make the letters not <i>too</i> arty and certainly not STOP ME BEFORE I KILL AGAIN scary,&#x201d; I had mentioned, and she has followed instructions well. I don&#x2019;t feel ridiculous, I feel kind of brave.</p> <p>I can&#x2019;t believe it. The very first car that goes by stops, and I run to hop in. An art-school type dressed in brown jeans and an old Charles Theater T-shirt is behind the wheel of a car so nondescript that I have to ask him what kind it is. &#x201c;A very used 1999 VW Passat sedan,&#x201d; he answers in the kindest voice imaginable. I feel safe immediately. He doesn&#x2019;t even bat an eye that I&#x2019;m hitchhiking, even though he recognizes me. &#x201c;Wow, John Waters. I&#x2019;m a fan,&#x201d; he announces, low-key. He so respects my privacy he doesn&#x2019;t even ask where I&#x2019;m headed but offers, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going as far as West Virginia if that&#x2019;s a help.&#x201d; &#x201c;It sure is,&#x201d; I say, relieved I can avoid the tricky cloverleaf where I-70 West meets the Baltimore Beltway and there&#x2019;s nowhere to stand to bum a ride.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you see Gaspar No�&#x2019;s <i>Enter the Void?</i>&#x201d; he asks with the excitement of a real film fanatic. &#x201c;Of course&#x2014;the best movie about taking drugs <i>ever!</i>&#x201d; I answer, so happy he wants to discuss other extreme pictures and not my own. &#x201c;I like the director&#x2019;s-cut version best,&#x201d; my driver continues, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s more endless, just like an LSD trip.&#x201d; &#x201c;I know Gaspar,&#x201d; I offer, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;d be surprised after seeing his films, but he&#x2019;s really a sweet guy.&#x201d; &#x201c;I love fucked-up movies,&#x201d; my fellow film buff enthuses as he turns up the radio, and what&#x2019;s playing? &#x201c;Hitch Hike&#x201d; by Marvin Gaye. Unbelievable!</p> <p>Is it me, or do I smell ganja? I&#x2019;m a little out of practice as a pothead. I used to smoke grass every day of my life around 1964 to 1972, but now only rarely because it just makes me worry about mundane things. But sometimes, in the summer in Provincetown on a Friday night when I have nothing to do the next day, I&#x2019;ll smoke a little weed and get &#x201c;launched,&#x201d; as my young friend and part-time pot smoker Frankie calls it when I start ranting and laughing while stoned. And of course I&#x2019;m a good host&#x2014;I have a small stash of pot in all my places of residence in case guests might want to smoke. Legal amounts. I hope.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Harris,&#x201d; he finally introduces himself, and I silently think, that&#x2019;s Divine&#x2019;s real first name, but keep it film-zealot friendly rather than Dreamland focused. Harris is a good-looking guy who seems laid-back, something I have never felt like in my entire life. I&#x2019;m thrilled my first ride is so seemingly uncomplicated. &#x201c;Are you a student at Maryland Institute?&#x201d; I ask, thinking college would be the perfect reason for him to be in Baltimore. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m in business for myself,&#x201d; he says with a sideways glance that invites all sorts of speculation as we merge onto the Baltimore Beltway headed in the right direction.</p> <p>&#x201c;Have you seen Armando B�&#x2019;s films?&#x201d; I ask, feeling as if continuing our movie-hound conversation is definitely part of my &#x201c;payment&#x201d; as a rider. &#x201c;I love his movies,&#x201d; Harris yells with enthusiasm as we head west on I-70, already on the first leg of my journey to San Francisco. &#x201c;Armando&#x2019;s been dead for many years now but he deserves to be honored more,&#x201d; I shout over the music, and my highway host agrees. &#x201c;That Isabel Sarli was <i>so</i> hot! Those tits were real, you know!&#x201d; he hollers in mammary mania about the director&#x2019;s onetime mistress and the star of all his films. &#x201c;<i>And</i> she&#x2019;s still alive!&#x201d; I shout. &#x201c;Seventy-five years old! I talked to her on the phone just recently,&#x201d; I brag, and I can tell he&#x2019;s impressed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding?&#x201d; Harris marvels in wide-eyed amazement. &#x201c;I really did,&#x201d; I answer, holding up my hand to silently swear to God. &#x201c;A South American trash-film enthusiast hooked us up, and although her English was a little rusty&#x2014;but way better than my Spanish&#x2014;I got to gush how much her films, like <i>Fury</i>, <i>Fever,</i> and <i>Fuego</i>, meant to both Divine and me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How come you aren&#x2019;t making a movie?&#x201d; Harris suddenly asks with shy concern. I explain I had a development deal to make <i>Fruitcake</i>, a &#x201c;terribly wonderful Christmas children&#x2019;s adventure,&#x201d; wrote the script, was about to make it, and then the recession happened, the independent film business as I knew it fell apart, and now all the distributors and film financiers want the budgets to be under $2 million, which I can&#x2019;t do anymore. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll back it,&#x201d; he says nonchalantly. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; I sputter, not believing my ears. &#x201c;You can keep a secret, right?&#x201d; he whispers conspiratorially. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I mumble, and I can, especially if it&#x2019;s a good one. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pot dealer&nbsp;&#x2026; don&#x2019;t worry, there&#x2019;s none in the car, it&#x2019;s all on my West Virginia farm, but I&#x2019;ve got plenty of cash. How much do you need?&#x201d; &#x201c;Five million, give or take,&#x201d; I confide with a chuckle, sure Harris is pulling my leg. &#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; he says, beaming as if I had just asked him for spare change in Berkeley in the sixties. &#x201c;But surely you&#x2019;re not serious?&#x201d; I ask, thinking, how could this be possible? I&#x2019;ve been trying to raise this budget unsuccessfully for five years. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; he says as we cross into West Virginia and I feel the thrill of illegal interstate financing. &#x201c;Maybe we could form a limited partnership like I used to do in the old days,&#x201d; I offer. &#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; he responds good-naturedly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just give you the cash and you pay me back if it ever breaks even.&#x201d; <i>Cash?!</i> I think in alarm. Five million dollars in cash?! &#x201c;Good God, how will I ever explain this to the IRS?!&#x201d; I ask Harris in bewildered excitement. &#x201c;The Feds don&#x2019;t ask where you got it, do they?&#x201d; he replies levelheadedly. &#x201c;Just pay me back and I&#x2019;ll get the money laundered by a chain of nail salons I&#x2019;m a silent partner in.&#x201d; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say in shock, not wanting to blow the deal if he was possibly serious.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m so stunned by my new &#x201c;business partner&#x201d; that I don&#x2019;t even notice we&#x2019;ve exited the interstate and are now driving on a country road. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re near,&#x201d; Harris explains as he goes around the block a few times and zigzags back and forth on even smaller rural routes. I guess he&#x2019;s making sure we&#x2019;re not being followed, but I keep my newly green-lit mouth shut.</p> <p>Finally, we turn off on a beautiful dirt lane with a natural canopy of trees overhead and then veer off on an unmarked long driveway nestled in the hills of northern West Virginia and go about another half mile. Ahead of us is a lovingly restored but not overly yuppified 1850s farmhouse overlooking a pond with a waterfall gently cascading into it. Expansive trees and flowering plants surround the entire idyllic setting. His incredibly striking wife, barefoot already in May and dressed in a pair of fire-engine-red jeans and a long-sleeved black T-shirt, is watering the potted flowers on the outdoor patio.</p> <p>&#x201c;This is Laura,&#x201d; Harris introduces us, &#x201c;and of course you know John Waters and his films.&#x201d; She smiles a warm welcome and I can&#x2019;t help but notice she smells like pot, too. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give him five million dollars to make his new film,&#x201d; he casually mentions, and she doesn&#x2019;t look particularly surprised. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s sweet,&#x201d; Laura says, hardly looking up from the pot of black tulips (my favorite kind) she&#x2019;s just placed artfully on an outdoor table. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been looking to invest in films for such a long time,&#x201d; she offers happily. I grin but remain silent in stupefaction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make us some lunch,&#x201d; offers Harris, before trotting off to the main farmhouse to prepare as Laura follows, eager to help.</p> <p>I just sit there in amazement at my good fortune. This is my first ride and already I&#x2019;m going to be back in the movie business. Harris and Laura soon return and we feast on delicious chicken salad made from free-range birds that Laura confides she strangled with her own hands just this morning. After a dessert of freshly picked blueberries, Harris carefully folds his cloth napkin (&#x201c;From Martick&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he proudly announces, a recently closed restaurant much loved by downtown-Baltimore bohemians) and says, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a walk, John.&#x201d; I eagerly follow him to a remote point of his property, and Harris reveals that we are now going &#x201c;to dig up the cash.&#x201d; I keep my mouth shut. &#x201c;Oh, honey,&#x201d; he yells to Laura, &#x201c;call up that FedEx place and make sure our buddy gets his lazy ass to work. Tell him we got a special shipment coming up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Harris turns to me and asks gently, &#x201c;Do you have a FedEx number? If not, we have a dummy one we can use.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to FedEx the money?&#x201d; I ask in awe, amazed that Harris plans on giving me the money <i>now</i>! &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he replies, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t want to carry all that cash with you on your hitchhiking trip, do you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; I stammer, giving him the digits, which I know from memory. &#x201c;Great,&#x201d; he says, jotting down the account information, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll FedEx it directly to your address.&#x201d; On cue, Laura walks like a gazelle down from the house, carrying a stack of flat FedEx boxes ready to be assembled. She has a lovely, serene smile on her lips. Maybe this is the first of their millions they&#x2019;re giving away. You can tell philanthropy brings her a new kind of delight.</p> <p>Harris grabs a shovel from behind the naturally distressed original barn door and leads me to an even more distant part of his farmland that appears to be overgrown with vines. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he announces as he pulls up several clods of phony earth covered in prop foliage and begins digging. Laura slips on a pair of rubber gloves. Harris hasn&#x2019;t even worked up a sweat before I hear the shovel clink on metal. &#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; purrs Laura as she gives me a friendly wink. &#x201c;Pay dirt,&#x201d; jokes Harris as he begins to hoist up, with his thin but muscled arms, a small industrial safe with a combination lock. Laura hands me the first of the standard large FedEx boxes and gets out a pistol-grip tape dispenser. She quickly notices from my panicked expression that I have no idea how to assemble these boxes and gently takes the packaging back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she whispers gently, &#x201c;you deserve to be directing, not doing manual labor.&#x201d; Laura snaps the carton together in one swift motion and seals it with tape like Quick Draw McGraw and hands me back the box with the skill of a next-day-delivery artisan. Harris drops the safe to the ground and Laura swiftly dials the combination and I avert my eyes, hoping to not look greedy or, worse yet, sneaky. Harris moves to another spot of earth about thirty feet away, rips up more fake turf, and starts digging again. I hear him whistling &#x201c;There&#x2019;s No Business Like Show Business&#x201d; with surprising skill.</p> <p>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; Laura says softly to me as she opens the safe door and hands me the first bundle of ten thousand $100 bills, which she assures me totals $1 million. It seems heavy to me but she scoffs mildly and says, &#x201c;It only weighs about twenty-five pounds. I&#x2019;ve had to carry $3 million strapped inside baggy winter clothes at customs, and believe me, that&#x2019;s a backbreaker, but I never complain. Helping keep Americans high is never easy or without toil.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s more cash!&#x201d; Harris cheerfully announces as he manually raises a duplicate safe from another &#x201c;grave&#x201d; in the ground and spins the combination lock like a safecracker supreme. &#x201c;This ought to pay for a lot of music rights,&#x201d; he chuckles happily to me, holding up the next million dollars in bills. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t Johnny Knoxville like getting paid in cash?&#x201d; Laura asks with a kindness so rare in show business today. &#x201c;He sure will,&#x201d; I agree, impressed that she is so well-read on my career that she knows whom I want to star in my next film. How we&#x2019;ll handle Johnny&#x2019;s agent in an all-cash deal is something I&#x2019;ll figure out later.</p> <p>It takes about an hour more, but finally Harris and Laura have dug up three other little safes and unloaded all the do-re-mi into nine large FedEx boxes. I gather this is not putting much of a dent in their nontraditional banking practices. &#x201c;We trust you,&#x201d; says Harris warmly as he seals the last box. &#x201c;Yes, we do,&#x201d; adds Laura, with a criminal-capitalist inner peace I&#x2019;ll never forget. &#x201c;This is our small way of thanking you for all your films,&#x201d; she adds, &#x201c;and we know <i>Fruitcake</i> will be a hit.&#x201d; &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t change a thing in the script if you don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Harris pipes in jovially. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t care if the film makes us our money back or not.&#x201d; &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; announces Laura with excitement, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s time to get you up to the FedEx place. You&#x2019;ve got a hitchhiking trip to go on.&#x201d; &#x201c;And may all your rides be as prosperous as this first one,&#x201d; adds Harris with financial affection and artistic respect.</p> <p>I embrace my new non-note-giving movie producers, and Harris and I load all the boxes into the trunk of his vehicle. We get in and wave goodbye to Laura, who is already back to potting her perennials like a serenely demented garden-club enthusiast. Just as we pull off, a black butterfly lands on her shoulder in a Douglas Sirk way, and she returns the farewell gesture with a smile that would put Julia Roberts out of business.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you see <i>Zoo</i>?&#x201d; Harris suddenly asks once we are on the road, eager to get back to cult-film talk. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I answer with pride, &#x201c;that arty true-crime doc about the man who dies after getting fucked by a horse in Seattle. I toured presenting that film&#x2014;even showed it at the Sydney Opera House.&#x201d; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one,&#x201d; Harris agrees. &#x201c;I felt for those guys who were involved,&#x201d; he reasons; &#x201c;it was a sad story but told in a dignified way.

Finally in 1998 he and his wife Gerda corrected this omission by adopting Trixie, a Golden Retriever and trained assistance dog, who had been forced by elbow problems to retire in her third year of service. It was the happiest forced retirement imaginable--for Trixie, for the Koontzes, and for all of us who are now privileged to read Dean Koontz&#x2019;s loving memoir of this remarkable being: <em>A Big Little Life</em>.</p> <p>Like all great writers, Koontz has the ability to transform the ordinary--his daily life with Trixie--into the funny, the moving, and the sublime. Trixie&#x2019;s accidentally gashing him while they play fetch turns into one of the great set pieces of medical comedy as Koontz ends up in the emergency room with a lacerated hand. On another occasion Trixie&#x2019;s saying &#x201c;baw&#x201d; for &#x201c;ball&#x201d;--straining to say it, but saying it nonetheless--becomes a memorable recounting of all of our attempts to communicate with beings from another species. And Koontz&#x2019;s simply watching Trixie move, her lithe golden body shimmering and flashing in the sun, takes on the quality of the divine as he expresses what so many of us have subconsciously thought about our own dogs: &#x201c;The more I watched her, the more she seemed to be an embodiment of that greatest of all graces we now and then glimpse, from which we intuitively infer the hand of God.&#x201d;</p> <p>It is no exaggeration to say that Trixie was the hand of God for Koontz. He recounts his difficult childhood, his dysfunctional father, and the many challenges that he had to overcome on the road to becoming a world-famous novelist. But with that fame came commercial caution: telling stories in the same old familiar way and a consequent dulling of his creativity. Then came Trixie. With &#x201c;baws&#x201d; and balls, with warning him of fires and intruders in the house, with humor, with stoicism, and with unflinching love, she restored his diminished sense of wonder and impelled him toward taking new risks with narratives, themes, and characters, the very ones millions of us now enjoy.</p> <p>&#x201c;Some dog, huh?&#x201d; he says.</p> <p>&#x201c;Some dog, yes,&#x201d; we must agree, also concurring when he adds, &#x201c;The only significant measure of your life is the positive effect you have on others.&#x201d;</p> <p>For all of us who have had our lives made better by our dogs, or for that matter by any loving being, <em>A Big Little Life</em> is a welcome reminder of the power of love to turn our hearts into mirrors, reflecting compassion back into the universe--as Trixie most surely did for Koontz and Koontz now does for us.</p> <p></p><b>Dean Koontz</b> won an Atlantic Monthly fiction competition when he was a senior in college, and he's been writing ever since.

The paramount reason for daily meditation is to get into the gap between our thoughts, and make conscious contact with the creative energy of life itself. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains the soul-nourishing meditation technique for making conscious contact with God, which the ancient masters have told us about. You have the potential to be an instrument of the highest good for all concerned and to be a literal miracle worker in your own life. No person, government, or religion can legitimately claim to do this for you. &#x201c;In fact,&#x201d; says Dr. Dyer, &#x201c;I agree with Carl Jung who said, &#x2018;One of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.&#x2019;&#x201d; When you master getting into the gap and staying there for prolonged segments of meditation, and experience what you bring back to the material world, you will know your answer to the question: &#x201c;Why meditate?&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Affectionately called the &#x201c;father of motivation&#x201d; by his fans,&nbsp;<b>Dr. Wayne W.

How clever are these birds? Do they have a language? These are some of the riddles that noted sociobiologist Bernd Heinrich, author of Bumblebee Economics and winner of the John Burroughs Medal, explores in this intriguing book. 16 pages of drawings.</p><p>Ravens are among the most elusive and yet (or, consequently) fascinating animals of North American I have ever encountered. Heinrich--an incredibly patient and cold-hardy fellow, not to mention, a heck of a writer--studied ravens in the dead of winter in Maine, and made some remarkable discoveries of how these normally solitary birds would actually engage in food sharing. Few of the many works on behavioral ecology I have read so compellingly capture the tedium of field work, the inscrutability of subject animals, and the satisfaction of discovery that provides even greater warmth than a blazing wood fire in the middle of a northern winter.

Steeped in myth and magical realism, Wright's hypnotic storytelling exposes the heartbreaking realities of Aboriginal life. <br> <br> By turns operatic and everyday, surreal and sensational, the novel teems with extraordinary, larger-than-life characters. From the outcast savior Elias Smith, religious zealot Mossie Fishman, and murderous mayor Bruiser to activist Will Phantom and Normal Phantom, ruler of the family, these unforgettable characters transcend their circumstances and challenge assumptions about the downtrodden "other." Trapped between politics and principle, past and present, the indigenous tribes fight to protect their natural resources, sacred sites, and above all, their people. <br> <br> Already an international bestseller, <i>Carpentaria</i> has garnered praise from around the world.</p><p>Alexis Wright, a member of the Waanyi nation of the southern highlands of the Gulf of Carpentaria, is one of Australia&#x2019;s most acclaimed and fearless writers. Her previous novel, <i>Carpentaria</i>, won the Miles Franklin Award, Australia's most prestigious literary prize.Carpentaria Chapter 1<p></p> From time immemorial<p></p> <br>A NATION CHANTS, BUT WE KNOW YOUR STORY ALREADY.<br> <br>THE BELLS PEAL EVERYWHERE.<br> <br>CHURCH BELLS CALLING THE FAITHFUL TO THE TABERNACLE WHERE THE GATES OF HEAVEN WILL OPEN, BUT NOT FOR THE WICKED.

LITTLE GIRLS WHO COME BACK HOME AFTER CHURCH ON SUNDAY, WHO LOOK AROUND THEMSELVES AT THE HUMAN FALLOUT AND ANNOUNCE MATTER-OF-FACTLY, ARMAGEDDON BEGINS HERE.<br> <br>The ancestral serpent, a creature larger than storm clouds, came down from the stars, laden with its own creative enormity. It moved graciously&#x2014;if you had been watching with the eyes of a bird hovering in the sky far above the ground. Looking down at the serpent&#x2019;s wet body, glistening from the ancient sunlight, long before man was a creature who could contemplate the next moment in time. It came down those billions of years ago, to crawl on its heavy belly, all around the wet clay soils in the Gulf of Carpentaria.<br> <br>Picture the creative serpent, scoring deep into&#x2014;scouring down through&#x2014;the slippery underground of the mudflats, leaving in its wake the thunder of tunnels collapsing to form deep sunken valleys. The sea water following in the serpent&#x2019;s wake, swarming in a frenzy of tidal waves, soon changed colour from ocean blue to the yellow of mud. The water filled the swirling tracks to form the mighty bending rivers spread across the vast plains of the Gulf country. The serpent travelled over the marine plains, over the salt flats, through the salt dunes, past the mangrove forests and crawled inland. Then it went back to the sea. And it came out at another spot along the coastline and crawled inland and back again. When it finished creating the many rivers in its wake, it created one last river, no larger or smaller than the others, a river which offers no apologies for its discontent with people who do not know it. This is where the giant serpent continues to live deep down under the ground in a vast network of limestone aquifers. They say its being is porous; it permeates everything. It is all around in the atmosphere and is attached to the lives of the river people like skin.<br> <br>This tidal river snake of flowing mud takes in breaths of a size that is difficult to comprehend. Imagine the serpent&#x2019;s breathing rhythms as the tide flows inland, edging towards the spring waters nestled deeply in the gorges of an ancient limestone plateau covered with rattling grasses dried yellow from the prevailing winds. Then with the outward breath, the tide turns and the serpent flows back to its own circulating mass of shallow waters in the giant water basin in a crook of the mainland whose sides separate it from the open sea.<br> <br>To catch this breath in the river you need the patience of one who can spend days doing nothing. If you wait under the rivergum where those up-to-no-good Mission-bred kids accidentally hanged Cry-baby Sally, the tip of the dead branch points to where you will see how the serpent&#x2019;s breath fights its way through in a tunnel of wind, creating ripples that shimmer silver, similar to the scales of a small, nocturnal serpent, thrashing in anger whenever the light hits its slippery translucent body, making it writhe and wrench to escape back into its natural environment of darkness.<br> <br>The inside knowledge about this river and coastal region is the Aboriginal Law handed down through the ages since time began. Otherwise, how would one know where to look for the hidden underwater courses in the vast flooding mud plains, full of serpents and fish in the monsoon season? Can someone who did not grow up in a place that is sometimes underwater, sometimes bone-dry, know when the trade winds blowing off the southern and northern hemispheres will merge in summer? Know the moment of climatic change better than they know themselves? Who fishes in the yellow-coloured monsoonal runoff from the drainages, with sheets of deep water pouring into the wide rivers swollen over their banks, filling vast plains with flood waters? The cyclones linger and regroup, the rain never stops pouring, but the fat fish are abundant.<br> <br>It takes a particular kind of knowledge to go with the river, whatever its mood. It is about there being no difference between you and the movement of water as it seasonally shifts its tracks according to its own mood. A river that spurns human endeavour in one dramatic gesture, jilting a lover who has never really been known, as it did to the frontier town built on its banks in the hectic heyday of colonial vigour. A town intended to serve as a port for the shipping trade for the hinterland of Northern Australia.<br> <br>In one moment, during a Wet season early in the last century, the town lost its harbour waters when the river simply decided to change course, to bypass it by several kilometres. Just like that. Now the waterless port survives with more or less nothing to do. Its citizens continue to engage in a dialogue with themselves passed down the generations on why the town should continue to exist. They stayed on to safeguard the northern coastline from invasion by the Yellow Peril. A dreadful vision, a long yellow streak marching behind an arrowhead pointing straight for the little town of Desperance. Eventually the heat subsided. When the Yellow Peril did not invade, everyone had a good look around and found a more contemporary reason for existence. It meant the town still had to be vigilant. Duty did not fall on one or two; duty was everybody&#x2019;s business. To keep a good eye out for whenever the moment presented itself, to give voice to a testimonial far beyond personal experience&#x2014;to comment on the state of their blacks. To do so was regarded as an economic contribution to State rights, then, as an afterthought, to maintaining the decent society of the nation as a whole.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Normal Phantom was an old tribal man, who lived all of his life in the dense Pricklebush scrub on the edge of town. He lived amidst thickets of closely growing slender plants with barely anything for leaves, which never gave an ant an inch of shelter under a thousand thorny branches. This foreign infestation on the edge of Desperance grew out of an era long before anyone in the Phantom family could remember. They had lived in a human dumping ground next to the town tip since the day Normal Phantom was born. All choked up, living piled up together in trash humpies made of tin, cloth, and plastic too, salvaged from the rubbish dump. The descendants of the pioneer families, who claimed ownership of the town, said the Aboriginal was really not part of the town at all. Sure, they worked the dunny cart in the old days, carted the rubbish, and swept the street. Furthermore, they said, the Aboriginal was dumped here by the pastoralists, because they refused to pay the blackfella equal wages, even when it came in. Right on the edge of somebody else&#x2019;s town, didn&#x2019;t they? Dumped the lot of them without any sign of lock, stock, or barrel.<br> <br>No, the Pricklebush was from the time before the motor car, when goods and chattels came up by camel train until Abdul and Abdullah, the old Afghan brothers, disappeared along the track called the &#x201c;lifeline,&#x201d; connecting north to south. After much time had passed the jokes came about Afghans being shifty dogs, dodgy dogs, murdering dogs, and unreliable. When the cupboards turned bare, the town talk finally turned to the realisation that very likely the camel men were never coming back&#x2014;then everyone in town assumed they had died. A few of the Christian-minded, trying to capitalise on the gross lack of decency in town, sniffed, Well! That ought to teach you now, won&#x2019;t it? But no one else thought so, because by then the grog and the tucker were being freighted up by mail truck, which everyone thought was a more convenient method of road transport by any stretch of the imagination.<br> <br>One cloud-covered night, the camels finally turned up in Desperance, jingling and a-jangling, their foreign bells swaying around their necks, vespers on such a still night. The residents woke up in childlike fright, sitting straight up in their beds, eyes wide open like zombies, seeing dark figures moving in their pitch-black bedroom, same time reckoning it was ghosts with an Afghan smell, true God, just came straight in, levitating, taking over, helping themselves, walking around people&#x2019;s homes with no mind youse, not one shred of good manners whatsoever. Couldn&#x2019;t even knock on the door first before coming into someone&#x2019;s house. That was the trouble with new Australians, the town claimed: Even dead ones had no manners. Unnaturalised. Really un-Australian. You shoulda sent out a search party. What a relief it was for dawn to come and everyone could see for themselves it was just poor old Abdul&#x2019;s and Abdullah&#x2019;s camels.<br> <br>Over the following days no one thought to capture the animals to retrieve the rotting pack saddles. The townsfolk had a deeply felt aversion to touching the belongings of dark-skinned foreigners&#x2014;or their animals. So, the camels just wandered around at their own will, covered with sores from the rotting packs of foodstuff: flour, sugar, grain growing sprouts that had died, still strapped over and hanging off their backs until something had to be done. The poor beasts were officially rounded up. The screaming, uncooperative animals didn&#x2019;t comprehend English, or barbarism either. After being hounded for several hours by their pursuers on foot and horseback, and stoned and whipped, the camels were eventually moved out over the claypans and shot. In the archival records written with a thick nib by a heavy-handed municipal clerk it is recorded, Camels removed. The first entry of work completed by the Town&#x2019;s Municipal Council.<br> <br>In the old camel-drivers&#x2019; camps the seeds of mimosa embedded in camel dung sprouted their hard little shoots in the Wet season. Thousands of seeds spread along every track and gully, flooding with sheetwater from the rain to regenerate in shallow mud pools. The shoots sent down their fat roots to take a steely grip on the claypans, holding the land together in a mirage that looked like it might last forever without water. In this mirage the cattle properties prospered on traditional lands taken but never ceded. Today, herds of Brahman-cross cattle leave their tracks crisscrossing the landscape in the dry season, as they search for stubbly patches of bluegrass and grind the top layers of soil to powdered bulldust.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The Pricklebush mob says that Normal Phantom could grab hold of the river in his mind and live with it as his father&#x2019;s fathers did before him. His ancestors were the river people, who were living with the river from before time began. Normal was like ebbing water; he came and went on the flowing waters of the river right out to the sea. He stayed away on the water as long as he pleased. He knew fish, and was on friendly terms with gropers, the giant codfish of the Gulf sea that swam in schools of fifty or more, on the move right up the river following his boat in for company. The old people say the groper lives for hundreds of years and maybe Normal would too. When he talked about the stars, they said he knew as much about the sky as he did about water. The prickly bush mob said he had always chased the constellations: We watched him as a little boy running off into the night trying to catch stars. They were certain he knew the secret of getting there. They thought he must go right up to the stars in the company of groper fish when it stormed at sea, when the sea and the sky became one, because, otherwise, how could he have come back?<br> <br>&#x201c;How you do that?&#x201d; was the question everyone asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The water doesn&#x2019;t worry me,&#x201d; Normal Phantom answered simply, although he knew that when his mind went for a walk, his body followed.<br> <br>Everyone in Desperance was used to the sight of Normal&#x2019;s jeep driving north to meet the river&#x2019;s edge. It was the only vehicle he had ever owned. Always, the small tinnie boat, full of dints, a stray bullet hole or two, strapped onto the roof. A vessel purchased with cross-country road transport in mind, much more than water safety.<br> <br>They say he knew these deep muddy waters better than the big salties: crocs that got tangled up in the nets in the middle of the night. Glassy-eyed monsters that came over the side of his tiny craft looking for action with the big river man. Jaws charging for a winner-takes-all kind of fight in the swamping boat, snapping in full flight, water splashing up into a storm with the swishing, thrash, thrash, thrashing of an angry tail against the side of the boat. People like to remember Normal saying in melancholy fashion (faking a thoroughly modern Americanised impersonation of a presidential Captain Hook): those snapping jaws meant diddly squat to him. Meanwhile, he moved like a hopping hare, fumbling for what seemed like ages to find the gun. Normal ended hundreds of lives of prehistoric living fossils this way, with his gun pointing all over the place in a turmoil of water and thick leather crankiness, until he made a direct hit between the eyes of the reptile caught in an instant of moonlight.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>In this otherwise quietly living population of about three hundred people, no living soul remembered what the port had looked like before. No picture could be put on display in a showcase at the museum of scarce memorabilia, because no one at the time of the heyday thought it was worthwhile to take a photo. But everybody knew that this was Normal&#x2019;s river.<br> <br>One day, someone in town, whose name is not worth a mention, was languishing around in a laconic stupor following the months of heatwave in the Wet season build-up, waiting for the rain to come. Lying flat out like a corpse on the bare linoleum floor in the hallway of a house exactly like the one next door. Capturing in a long sigh of appreciation the northern sea breezes that came waltzing straight over twenty-five kilometres of mudflats, whistling their arrival through the front door while, on the way out, slamming the back door open and shut. All of a sudden this someone of no consequence thought of changing the name of the river to Normal. And, in a town where change never came easy, it came to be.<br> <br>There was a celebration by the local Shire Council. The occasion was the anniversary of the port&#x2019;s first one hundred years. It coincided with a spate of unusual happenings during a short-lived era of Aboriginal domination of the Council. Harmless coercing of the natives, the social planners hummed, anxious to make deals happen for the impending mining boom. Meaningful coexistence could now accommodate almost any request whatsoever, including changing a river&#x2019;s name to Normal. During this honeymoon period, those Aboriginal people who took the plunge to be councillors wisely used their time in public office to pursue scraps of personal gain for their own families living amidst the muck of third-world poverty.<br> <br>All this was part and parcel of the excitement of Desperance when the first multinational mining company came into the region. Numerous short-lived profiteering schemes were concocted for the locals, in order to serve the big company&#x2019;s own interests as they set about pillaging the region&#x2019;s treasure trove: the publicly touted curve of an underground range embedded with minerals.<br> <br>The elaborate white linen ceremony, paid for by the mining company, attracted Southern politicians who flew in for the day. Most of them were known by the local dignitaries as a bunch of fly-by-nighters. And what&#x2019;s more, as they rolled out the welcome smile, some locals whispered unmentionable insults behi...</p><h2>Letters From Eden: A Year at Home, in the Woods</h2><p>At the age of seven, Julie Zickefoose knew that she wanted to paint birds for a living, and her lifelong dedication shows in her paintings, which are meticulously accurate as well as beautiful.

My heart sank, as it always does, to see a bird in a grocery store. I muttered a wish that it would be a house sparrow, but my bird watcher&#x2019;s eye had already decided it wasn&#x2019;t. I followed it through to the store&#x2019;s bakery counter, where I eventually located it, perched calmly in a revolving rack of birthday candles. I smiled when my eye fell upon it. In the little wire candle tree it had found the only remotely shrublike structure in the entire store and was quite well hidden amid the Barney and Blue&#x2019;s Clues birthday decorations. I could see just a part of its breast white, heavily streaked with brown. Song sparrow, I decided, just as it took off over the beverage aisle, headed back to produce.<br> Now, a sparrow, even a song sparrow, can live a mighty long time in a grocery store. Years, I&#x2019;d guess, if the management doesn&#x2019;t decide to do it in as a health hazard. It&#x2019;s got everything it needs, except, of course, freedom, a decent habitat, a mate, and other sparrows to hang out with. It can nibble the fresh kale and lettuce, peck the apples and grapes, scrounge for spilled seed in the pet and wild-bird sections. It can drink and even bathe in the automatic mist hissing down on the salad greens. It can hide in the candle rack or the houseplants, perch in the high light fixtures at the slightest hint of threat. Make no mistake, it&#x2019;s probably pretty unhappy, but it survives. The chances of its finding its way out through the double front doors or the heavy swinging loading dock doors are about nil. This store backs up onto a marsh preserve, and I guessed the sparrow had entered via the darkened loading dock and flown toward the lighted store proper when the swinging doors opened. I wanted to get it out of there.<br> I began asking around in the bakery section, where the ladies were quite forthcoming. He&#x2019;s been in here about a week,&#x201d; one told me. He&#x2019;s just as tame as can be. He&#x2019;ll let you come up and talk to him as close as you are to me, but you&#x2019;d better not have a bass net in your hand!&#x201d; She motioned to a large aluminum-handled fishing net leaning against the pastry counter. He knows when you&#x2019;re after him, and he doesn&#x2019;t want anything to do with you if you&#x2019;ve got that net in your hand.&#x201d; I could sense the respect in her voice, respect for a tiny brown bird. I named him Paul,&#x201d; she added a little sheepishly. Paul. It was the perfect name for this modest sparrow, and it told me volumes about how she felt about him.<br> I came back the next day with a sparrow trap, one designed to rid the premises of house sparrows. Baited with seed or bread, it&#x2019;s a simple wire box with a spring-loaded lid. When the bird jumps down onto a treadle, the lid slams shut and the sparrow is yours. I set it, mounded seed enticingly inside, and put it atop a doughnut case next to the birthday candle rack. I left my number with the bakery ladies and the store manager. A week later, I still hadn&#x2019;t gotten a call, so I returned. The trap was still open, unsprung. Paul had cleaned up all the stray seed around the outside but hadn&#x2019;t so much as stuck a toe inside the trap. This was going to be harder than I thought.<br> The store manager expressed his frustration. Used to be when we&#x2019;d get a bird in here I&#x2019;d just turn out all the store lights in the morning before anybody got here and open the loading dock doors, and out it would go, heading for the light. I got rid of any number of birds that way. But since they remodeled, a computer controls all the lights and I can&#x2019;t override it. I can&#x2019;t even turn out the lights in my own store!&#x201d; I pondered the implications of this statement. The situation seemed to me to be akin to a car whose windows couldn&#x2019;t be rolled down. This sounded like a plan that made sense at corporate headquarters, but not in the field. I assured the manager I&#x2019;d try my best to catch the sparrow some other way.<br> I took the trap home and rigged up two red plastic jar lids. One I taped to the top of the trap and partially filled with seed. The other I taped just inside the trap chamber so it could be reached with a short hop down into the chamber. This would accustom Paul to entering the chamber, even if he only had to hop an inch inside it. Finally, I wired the trap open so it could not spring shut. I wanted the trap to become Paul&#x2019;s happy place, his kitchen. I left it there for five days.<br> When I came back to check the trap, Paul had been in the store for over a month. The bakery ladies were ready for me, their eyes shining. I&#x2019;m not so sure you&#x2019;ll ever catch him,&#x201d; one woman said. He sits on the trap all day, but he doesn&#x2019;t ggo inside it.&#x201d; We&#x2019;ll see about that,&#x201d; I answered. I climbed up and retrieved the trap from the top of the doughnut case. Both fooddddd dishes were completely empty. Seed hulls were littered all around the cage. Paul had definitely been inside the trap chamber and he would go in again. And when he did, he&#x2019;d be mine.<br> This time, I taped a jar lid directly to the treadle inside the trap chamber and filled it with millet, sunflower, cracked corn, and peanut butter suet dough. It was irresistible fare for a hungry sparrow. In the lid atop the trap I put a meager single serving of the same food. Cackling, I climbed back up and replaced Paul&#x2019;s kitchen.<br> You know, that crazy bird will light on the trays of hot rolls just out of the big oven,&#x201d; a baker told me. I&#x2019;ll try to shoo him off, but he comes right back. And he goes way back into the deli. I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s after, but he&#x2019;s not scared of anything and he knows his way around here pretty good.&#x201d; There was obvious affection in her voice. She lowered it conspiratorially. I just feel sorry for him, though, and I&#x2019;m afraid one of these guys is going to try to get him one day.&#x201d; I grasped her meaning immediately. It can&#x2019;t be within the health code to have a sparrow hopping around on the bakery trays.<br> I reassured her. I predict that Paul will be in that trap by tomorrow morning.&#x201d; It was noon when I left the store.<br> I was finishing up the dinner dishes at 6:20 P.M. when the phone rang. It was the store&#x2019;s manager, and he was clearly excited. Is this Julie, with the bird trap?&#x201d; he asked.<br> Yes, it is!&#x201d; I answered.<br> Well, we have a bird in the trap!&#x201d; I whooped with joy. I told you! I told you I&#x2019;d get him! That&#x2019;s fantastic! Hang on to him while I call my husband! He&#x2019;ll be by in a couple of minutes to pick him up.&#x201d; I hung up and did a dance of joy around the kitchen. Phoebe and Liam danced, too, hollering and whooping. WE GOT HIM! WE GOT HIM! WE GREEN AND YELLOW GOT HIM!&#x201d; we sang.<br> We turned on the porch light and waited breathlessly for Bill. He came in, leading with the trap, a frantic Paul ricocheting around inside. I clutched the trap and peered inside. Paul gave a small peep of fear, and there was something familiar about his voice. His brow was faintly yellow, his streaking too fine, his belly too white . . . he was altogether too small . . . This is no song sparrow, I realized. Hey!<br> This is a Savannah sparrow!&#x201d; I exclaimed, agog. What were the odds? An uncommon migrant through the Mid Ohio Valley at best, a Savannah sparrow would be one of the last birds I&#x2019;d expect to see perched atop a birthday candle rack or a tray of hot buns.<br> I&#x2019;ll be darned,&#x201d; Bill said. I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to look at him in the excitement, but he didn&#x2019;t look much like a song sparrow to me when I picked him up.&#x201d; Carefully, I reached into the trap and brought Paul out into the light. So tiny, so sleek, so . . . fat. His high-carb diet had clearly agreed with him. Paul was padded. I took a bad snapshot of him clutched in one hand, then released him to the comparative comfort of a pet carrier, its floor covered with straw and natural perches. He settled down quickly and enjoyed his first dark night in more than a month. His temporary home had been a twenty-four- hour establishment; the lights never went out. I imagined all Paul had been through and what he must have been thinking. Was he thankful for the darkness? Glad for the feel of straw and wood beneath his feet? Happy for the quiet, away from humming refrigerator cases and floor buffers and the incessant beep of scanners? Aware that he was one heck of a lucky bird? Wondering what would become of him in the morning?<br> At 8:00 A.M., we donned coats and shoes and solemnly trooped out the front door with Paul&#x2019;s carrier. Liam said, I want to see that bird fly!&#x201d; Phoebe made sure she would be the one to open the carrier door. Paul hesitated, then shot out like a streaky brown arrow to the top of a birch tree, its leaves golden and drooping in a warm November drizzle. He looked down, up, all around. A few goldfinches settled in beside him. For twenty minutes Paul perched, his feet fumbling on the twigs, feet that were now more used to the feel of plastic and metal. He watched the juncos and goldfinches, the song sparrows and cardinals. He watched me scattering millet beneath his tree, talking softly to him. Then Paul wiped his bill, gave a soft tweet, and was gone, flying straight and true out over the meadow, headed south.<br><br>Copyright � 2006 by Julie Zickefoose.

At twenty-eight, she wants to change the direction of her troubled life but can&#x2019;t find her way&#x2014;until a new family settles into the rental trailer next door and she meets the young girl who will lead her on a remarkable quest that will change Micky herself and everything she knows&#x2014;or thinks she knows&#x2014;forever. <br><br>Despite the brace she must wear on her deformed left leg, and her withered left hand, nine-year-old Leilani Klonk radiates a buoyant and indomitable spirit that inspires Micky. Beneath Leilani&#x2019;s effervescence, however, Micky comes to sense a quiet desperation that the girl dares not express.<br><br>Leilani&#x2019;s mother is little more than a child herself. And the girl&#x2019;s stepfather, Preston Maddoc, is educated but threatening. He has moved the family from place to place as he fanatically investigates UFO sightings, striving to make contact, claiming to have had a vision that by Leilani&#x2019;s tenth birthday aliens will either heal her or take her away to a better life on their world.<br><br>Slowly, ever more troubling details emerge in Leilani&#x2019;s conversations with Micky. Most chilling is Micky&#x2019;s discovery that Leilani had an older brother, also disabled, who vanished after Maddoc took him into the woods one night and is now &#x201c;gone to the stars.&#x201d;<br><br>Leilani&#x2019;s tenth birthday is approaching. Micky is convinced the girl will be dead by that day. While the child-protection bureaucracy gives Micky the runaround, the Maddoc family slips away into the night. Micky sets out across America to track and find them, alone and afraid but for the first time living for something bigger than herself.<br><br>She finds herself pitted against an adversary, Preston Maddoc, as fearsome as he is cunning. The passion and disregard for danger with which Micky pursues her quest bring to her side a burned-out detective who joins her on a journey of incredible peril and startling discoveries, a journey through terrible darkness to unexpected light. <br><br><b>One Door Away From Heaven</b> is an incandescent mix of suspense and humor, fear and wonder, a story of redemption and timeless wisdom that will have readers cheering. Filled with tragedy and joy, with terror and hope, it solidifies Dean Koontz&#x2019;s reputation as one of the foremost storytellers of our time. This is Dean Koontz at his very best&#x2014;and it doesn&#x2019;t get any better than that.</p><p>Dean Koontz virtually invented the cross-genre novel, and in <i>One Door Away from Heaven</i> he mixes an action thriller with post-<i>X-Files</i> alien paranoia to remarkable effect. Micky Bellsong is a young woman at a crisis point in her life, using a stay at her Aunt Geneva's to sort things out. Then the precocious and deformed Leilani Klonk walks into her life, telling stories of her stepfather and drugged-up mother, who believe aliens will beam the girl into their mothership and heal her deformities before her 10th birthday. But tales of the stepfather's vicious past, including his hand in several murders, leave Micky believing that a far more terrible fate awaits her friend. So when the parents take off with Leilani, Micky pursues.<p> As is typical with a Koontz novel, nothing turns out to be what it seems, and the meticulously crafted plot tightens like a noose with every turn of the page. His characters are exceptionally drawn, driving the novel forward with realism and warmth. Micky is one of his more attractive young heroines, but the real star is Leilani, a mature young girl whose plucky nature and sparkling dialogue instantly make her Koontz's most memorable creation. She embodies his belief that despite violence, pain, and suffering, there is always goodness to be found in every person and situation. Koontz has once again proven why he is one of the premier novelists of his generation. <i>--Jonathan Weir, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#x201c;Dean Koontz is not just a master of our darkest dreams, but also a literary juggler.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; <i>The Times</i> (London)<br></p><h2>Jefferson&#39;s Children: Education and The Promise of American Culture</h2><p>The president of Bard College and musical director of the American Symphony Orchestra offers a learned antidote to conservative pessimism about America&#39;s future, showing how parents and teachers can offer the nation&#39;s youth a vision of progress.</p><p>A heavyweight educator springs out of the liberal corner bobbing and weaving, dealing a hail of punishing body blows to the neoconservative establishment. Botstein, the president of Bard College, is sick and tired of hearing neocons moan about how bad education is now and how good it was back in the old days of privilege. True: Education now is not so good, as he realistically concedes, but it was always pretty bad and has only been getting better over the years. Instead of indulging ourselves in such self-aggrandizing nostalgia, we must look with pride at our accomplishments (inclusion of traditionally excluded groups, programs like Head Start). We ought to be able, suggests Botstein, to set in motion a national enthusiasm for mental excellence along the order of our longstanding national craze for physical fitness. The value of learning must be emphasized in the home and community. But centrally we must transform our schools by creating ``a flexible system with new options that meet the new realities facing us.'' Among the new realities he cites is the fact (or maybe factoid) that the onset of puberty is now much earlier than it used to be. Our system was created in an era when children matured later. Consequently, Botstein advocates abolishing high school altogether. At 16, students would be dispersed into different kinds of educational options: four-year college for some, community college for others; vocational and professional training or national service would also be options. Teachers should be trained in a discipline rather than in ``education,'' and they should be better paid. We must break down the irrational preoccupation so many college-bound students (and their parents) have with getting into the ``best'' schools. A good undergraduate education is a good education, no matter whether it comes from the Ivy League or a less prestigious institution. Though this book is not destined to be popular among high- school administrators, Botstein makes a strong, shrewd, sensible case for his radical proposals. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Leading us chapter by chapter through its most important stories--from the Creation and the Tree of Knowledge through the Exodus from Egypt and the journey to the Promised Land--James Kugel shows how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. </p><p> Was the snake in the Garden of Eden the devil, or the Garden itself "paradise"? Did Abraham discover monotheism, and was his son Isaac a willing martyr? Not until the ancient interpreters set to work. Poring over every little detail in the Bible's stories, prophecies, and laws, they let their own theological and imaginative inclinations radically transform the Bible's very nature. Their sometimes surprising interpretations soon became the generally accepted meaning. These interpretations, and not the mere words of the text, <i>became</i> the Bible in the time of Jesus and Paul or the rabbis of the Talmud. </p><p> Drawing on such sources as the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish apocrypha, Hellenistic writings, long-lost retellings of Bible stories, and prayers and sermons of the early church and synagogue, Kugel reconstructs the theory and methods of interpretation at the time when the Bible was becoming the bedrock of Judaism and Christianity. Here, for the first time, we can witness all the major transformations of the text and recreate the development of the Bible "As It Was" at the start of the Common era--the Bible as we know it. </p></p><p>James Kugel's <i>The Bible As It Was</i> is an eye-opening study of early scriptural interpretation. Kugel focuses on readings of the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) from 100-300 A.D., particularly the Jewish tradition of <i>midrash</i>--a practice of filling in the narrative gaps where biblical stories are ambiguous or unclear. Kugel's interest in midrash is more than academic, however. He wants readers to consider the ways these early readings of the Bible affect today's popular understandings of scriptural texts (such as the sacrifice of Isaac or the creation in Genesis); and he provides a convincing description of the richness and complexity that informs what seem to many like simple, commonsense readings of scripture.<b>James L. Kugel</b> is a Professor at Bar-Ilan University.</p><h2>The Devil and Sonny Liston</h2><p>A biography of the controversial fighter follows Liston from the mean streets, where he was a petty criminal, to the heavyweight championship and his life as a pawn of organized crime. By the author of Power on Earth. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>&#34;Born in Newark and schooled in his father&#39;s bar, Nick Tosches is the author of acclaimed biographies of Dean Martin (Dino), the Mafia financier Michele Sindona (Power on Earth), and Jerry Lee Lewis (Hellfire); of two books about popular music (Country and Unsung Heroes of Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll); and of the novels Trinities and Cut Numbers. He is a contributing editor of Vanity Fair. He lives in New York City, and his poetry readings are legend.Tosches has always been drawn to the lives of dark and mysteriously flawed or fallen public figures--Jerry Lee Lewis in Hellfire, Dean Martin in Dino--and in one-time heavyweight champ Charles "Sonny" Liston he has found his biggest and darkest figure yet. Born in abject poverty in eastern Arkansas, Liston grew up to be a quiet, inarticulate youth who, after moving with his mother to St. Louis, put his only talent to work: intimidation. Knocking over gas stations and grocery stores, he ended up in a penitentiary doing eight years. His brawny build and huge hands made him an invincible force in the prison boxing program, which earned him an early release but delivered him into an enslavement from which he never escaped. Tosches marshals prodigious research to prove that, early on, Liston became captive to organized crime at a time when boxing was ruled by a mob syndicate. This is a very sad tale of an illiterate man who became useful to figures who had their own agenda: making money. Tosches finds people close to Liston who claim the fighter told them that his first bout with the man then known as Cassius Clay was fixed (with the mob taking down $2.1 million by betting on the 7-to-1 underdog); others strongly imply that the outcome of the second fight--that of the infamous "phantom punch"--in Lewiston, Maine, was also a foregone conclusion. Events around the beleaguered and bewildered Liston whirl at dizzying speeds--the Kefauver investigation of boxing, the war in Vietnam, the rise of the Nation of Islam, the cultural roar of the 1960s generation--and Tosches is a master at keeping his finger on the pulse of the period and his eye on the pitiable Sonny. Throughout, though, what is most remarkable is Tosches's empathy for the fighter derided as "a bear," a "hoodlum" and, by the loquacious Ali, as simply "ugly." In Tosches's hands, Liston is an unfortunate victim of people much worse than he, and the boxer emerges with a kind of mute dignity: this man "who neither knew his age nor felt any ties of blood upon this earth nor saw any future knew only that he was nobody and that he had come from nowhere and that he was nowhere." In a prose style that runs like a hot improvisational jazz riff, Tosches makes a somebody of a nobody, and along the way brings more than a few reputations down a good notch.

Waterhouse</h2><p>John William Waterhouse (1849-1917) is among the most popular Victorian artists, and many of his paintings have become icons of femininity recognized the world over. With their glowing colour, compelling composition and Impressionist-inflected technique, these paintings are admired for their beauty, yet at the same time have the power to transport viewers into a romantic world of myth and legend.<br>Waterhouse's art reflects not only his distinctive ideal of female beauty, but also a lifelong fascination with the Romantic and Symbolist themes of passion, magic and transformation - spiritual, erotic and physical. These themes also reflect the complex and ambivalent attitudes of his age. Peter Trippi presents a new analysis of Waterhouse's enchantresses, martyrs and nymphs, at the same time presenting a fresh and thoroughly researched review of this surprisingly enigmatic artist's life and the circumstances in which he painted.<br>Like other Victorian artists, Waterhouse was neglected through much of the twentieth century, but today he is acknowledged as a crucial inheritor of the Pre-Raphaelite legacy. Peter Trippi's monograph provides a timely re-evaluation that combines a close reading of Waterhouse's imagery with a new appraisal of his unique and enduring qualities.</p><p>Peter Trippi is currently Vice Director for Development at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.&#34;A fresh and absorbing analysis.&#34;-Antiques Trade Gazette &#34;Scholarly and detailed book.&#34;-Times Literary Supplement &#34;A must for Pre-Raphaelite fans.&#34;-The Argus &#34;This is good social art history in a sumptuous format.&#34;-Independent) &#34;Until I read this meticulously researched, cogently argued and handsomely illustrated book, all I knew about Waterhouse could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.&#34;-World of Interiors) &#34;While the book places the artist within his era, it is Trippi&#39;s sensitive descriptions of the works and his attention to technique and the painted surface that give his method innovation and insight. The handsome colour plates, including double-page spreads of such monumental works as St Cecilia (1895) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896) as well as the hitherto unreproduced Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May (1909), substantiate Trippi&#39;s assertion that Waterhouse&#39;s complex aesthetic still compels audiences today.&#34;-Art Quarterly &#34;Beautifully designed, sumptuously illustrated and reasonably priced...

Ellis, author of <b>Founding Brothers</b><br><br>A magnificent account of the revolution in arms and consciousness that gave birth to the American republic.<br><br>When Abraham Lincoln sought to define the significance of the United States, he naturally looked back to the American Revolution. He knew that the Revolution not only had legally created the United States, but also had produced all of the great hopes and values of the American people. Our noblest ideals and aspirations-our commitments to freedom, constitutionalism, the well-being of ordinary people, and equality-came out of the Revolutionary era. Lincoln saw as well that the Revolution had convinced Americans that they were a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty. The Revolution, in short, gave birth to whatever sense of nationhood and national purpose Americans have had.<br><br>No doubt the story is a dramatic one: Thirteen insignificant colonies three thousand miles from the centers of Western civilization fought off British rule to become, in fewer than three decades, a huge, sprawling, rambunctious republic of nearly four million citizens. But the history of the American Revolution, like the history of the nation as a whole, ought not to be viewed simply as a story of right and wrong from which moral lessons are to be drawn. It is a complicated and at times ironic story that needs to be explained and understood, not blindly celebrated or condemned. How did this great revolution come about? What was its character? What were its consequences? These are the questions this short history seeks to answer. That it succeeds in such a profound and enthralling way is a tribute to Gordon Wood&#x2019;s mastery of his subject, and of the historian&#x2019;s craft.</p><p>Gordon S. Wood's <i>The American Revolution</i>, part of the Modern Library Chronicles series, is an erudite, concise summary of the events and circumstances surrounding the seminal conflict, both physical and philosophical, in American history. The Modern Library Chronicles are accessible-but-serious works of scholarship, meant to serve as introductions (or refresher courses) on large subjects for interested readers. <i>The American Revolution</i> is an excellent case in point. Wood deftly describes seeds of the Revolution, most notably disgruntlement on the colonists' part brought about by increasingly maladroit and fiscally punishing British policies. He then follows the course of actual warfare and its aftermath, most interestingly the fraught, bitter battle to draw a governing blueprint for the new country. <p> Wood breaks little new interpretive ground himself, here, but as a synthesizer (and amiable, skillful narrator/guide) he stands on high ground. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i></p>"An elegant synthesis done by the leading scholar in the field, which nicely integrates the work on the American Revolution over the last three decades but never loses contact with the older, classic questions that we have been arguing about for over two hundred years."<br>- Joseph J. Ellis, Author of <b>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</b></p><h2>Remarkable Names of Real People</h2><p>From the front flap of this 64 page book: &#34;&#39;In assembling this gallimaufry of actual names, the industrious Mr. Train has ransacked nature to confirm the extraordinary riches of the world around us,&#39; writes S.J. Perelman of John Train&#39;s unusual enterprise. And here is the culmination of his search - a connoisseur&#39;s collection of the most remarkable and amusing names on record, assembled with the help of an international network of assiduous correspondents and wryly annotated by the author. The gathering reflects Mr. Train&#39;s strict standards of selection and the years of research that have been devoted to verifying the subjects&#39; names and occupations. An earlier smaller edition, distributed through the &#39;Paris Review&#39; under the title of &#39;How to Name Your Baby&#39;, was said to be one of the most highly stolen books in publishing history. This expanded version - its delicate drawings by Pierre Le-Tan perfectly complementing the sardonic, scholarly wit of Mr. Train - is certain to be even more fervently enjoyed. A superbly written book, already hailed as a classic.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Where&#39;s Waldo?

But the most disturbing aspect of Agent Gerald Clark's death has his superiors in Washington baffled. When Agent Clark first came to the Amazon, he had only one arm-the result of a well-paced sniper's bullet. But the photograph of him submitted by a Brazilian morgue shows a corpse with two upper limbs fully intact.<br><br> Nathan Rand has made the Amazon region his home since his father led a scientific mission into the lush green wilderness and never returned-the same doomed expedition that took Gerald Clark into the jungle. Now the government wants Nate to follow the elder Rand's trail, accompanied by a team of scientists and a phalanx of experienced U.S. Rangers.

As Nate Rand and his party push deeper into the jungle, they are haunted by an ugly truth that cannot be dismissed and, perhaps, will not be survived: They are not alone...and they are bing stalked.<br><br> But the threat of mortal hungers poles before the nightmare that awaits fourteen unsuspecting men and women, as each step brings them closer to an ancient, unspoken terror that even the native people dread. And as madness, fear, and horrific, death descend upon the second cursed Rand expedition , those still living are imagining-one that can forever alter the world beyond the dark, lethal confines of the Amazon rainforest for betters...and for worse.</p><h2>Who Owns the Sun</h2><p>Having learned from the father he admires so much that the world is filled with things too special for any one person to own, a boy is upset to hear that he and his father are owned by the men in the big house where they work</p><p>At fourteen years of age, Stacy Chbosky wrote and illustrated WHO OWNS THE SUN? and won The 1987 National Written and Illustrated By...

In Who Owns the Sun?, 14-year-old Chbosky has written a lyrical tale of the need for freedom and of the dignity of the human spirit. A young black boy observes the wonders of nature and asks his father who owns them. Although told that no one can "own" such marvels, the boy learns that his father--this man whom he reveres above all else--is, indeed, owned by another. The Half &amp; Half Dog, by 12-year-old Gross, is a story of tolerance, of a dog learning that he is worthy of love, and that his unusual appearance makes him special. Joshua Disobeys, by six-year-old Vollmer, tells the story of a young whale that fails to heed its mother's warning and is dangerously beached until it is rescued by an angry yet ever-devoted parent. The book can serve well as a starting point for discussions on parent/child relations, and the two pages of facts on whales will make it a suitable choice for units on whaling. While the strength of the books lies in their texts, the watercolor and marker illustrations have pronounced colors and are often suggestive of expressionistic styles. These books will prove worthwhile additions for promoting values discussions and in encouraging creative writing. --Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, Wheeler School, Providence, R.I.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book of 2012</b><br>Whether it&#x2019;s in a cockpit at takeoff or the planning of an offensive war, a romantic relationship or a dispute at the office, there are many opportunities to lie and self-deceive&#x2014;but deceit and self-deception carry the costs of being alienated from reality and can lead to disaster. So why does deception play such a prominent role in our everyday lives? In short, why do we deceive?<br>In his bold new work, prominent biological theorist Robert Trivers unflinchingly argues that self-deception evolved in the service of deceit&#x2014;the better to fool others. We do it for biological reasons&#x2014;in order to help us survive and procreate. From viruses mimicking host behavior to humans misremembering (sometimes intentionally) the details of a quarrel, science has proven that the deceptive one can always outwit the masses. But we undertake this deception at our own peril.<p>Trivers has written an ambitious investigation into the evolutionary logic of lying and the costs of leaving it unchecked.</p></p><p><b>Robert L. Trivers</b> is a Professor of Anthropology and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University. He won the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences in 2007 for his fundamental analysis of social evolution, conflict, and cooperation. He lives in New Brunswick, New Jersey.<p><b><i>Kirkus Reviews (starred)</i></b><br> &#x201c;Self-deception has long been a dark, opaque side of our behavior, but the author brings a bright flashlight to his investigation of why we alter information to reach a falsehood.... Trivers examines our biases and rationalizations, denials and projections, misrepresentation and manipulations, and his writing is comfortable and suasive, resulting from his familiarity and command of the subject&#x2019;s broad application and investigative history.... A gripping inquiry. Trivers is informal but highly knowledgeable, provocative, brightly humorous and inviting.&#x201d;</p><b><i>Library Journal</i></b>&#x201c;Looking at self-deception in broader areas like war, religion, false historical narratives, and even plane crashes, Trivers presents a convincing argument for why this type of dishonesty is as harmful to the individual as it is to society as a whole....

But even if he does suffer from over-confidence&#x2014;a type of self-deception more common in males&#x2014;the admirable breadth, clarity and ambition of the result more than vindicate nature&#x2019;s creation of the blind spot.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br></b>&#x201c;After forty years of research Trivers wrote [<i>The Folly of Fools</i>] against the backdrop of a global economic meltdown caused by self-deceived, over-confident egoists grossly out of touch with reality, and when he explains how the human male drive for power and control correlates with ignorance and self-delusion, your blood runs cold.... [<i>The Folly of Fools</i>] is an exhilarating read: the intertwined issues of deceit and self-deception are infinite, involving positive and negative outcomes for the fool and the fooled&#x2014;roles that can reverse and revert without your even knowing.&#x201d;<p><b><i>Discover<br></i></b>&#x201c;Weaving together examples from biology, psychology, history, and immunology, evolutionary theorist Robert Trivers argues that we deceive ourselves in order to better deceive others, and do so in order to survive, procreate, and generally get ahead.... [A] thoroughly researched, thought-provoking read.&#x201d;</p><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Trivers] probably knows more about the mechanics and meaning of deception than almost anyone else in the world, and his new book, <i>The Folly of Fools</i>, covers pretty much anything you&#x2019;d want to know about the topic.... Expansive, smart and deep, the book&#x2014;a relentlessly fascinating and entertaining read&#x2014;will utterly change the way you think about lying.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>David P. Barash, <i>Evolutionary Psychology </i></b>&#x201c;[I]t would be folly indeed to ignore the book&#x2019;s scientific insights, its provocative suggestions, and&#x2014;perhaps most of all&#x2014;the sheer intellectual delight in reading something that is so cogent, so relevant to one&#x2019;s own daily life, and, it must be said, so damned obvious ... once a genius like Robert Trivers points it out! (Please note: I don&#x2019;t use the &#x2018;g-word&#x2019; often, or lightly.)&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;[Trivers is] an immensely original thinker in biology. His strength has been to see conflict where other people see only harmony.... Whereas others see optimism and self-deception as a defensive strategy to stay sane and happy in a harsh world, he sees it as a psychological attack mechanism, &#x2018;fooling yourself to better fool others,&#x2019; he says.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Economist</i></b>&#x201c;In <i>The Folly of Fools</i> Robert Trivers...explains that the most effectively devious people are often unaware of their deceit. Self-deception makes it easier to manipulate others to get ahead. Particularly intelligent people can be especially good at deceiving themselves. Mining research in biology, neurophysiology, immunology and psychology, Mr. Trivers delivers a swift tour of the links between deception and evolutionary progress.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Psychology Today</i></b>&#x201c;Read this if...You&#x2019;re hungry for assumption-challenging explanations for your everyday behavior. Well-articulated and convincing, Trivers&#x2019;s theory draws on group dynamics, neuroscience, and even immunology to explain why we&#x2019;re all liars. Ultimately, he concludes that we&#x2019;re best off sensing&#x2014;and telling&#x2014;the truth whenever possible.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Salon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] provocative and wide-ranging book.... Trivers touches on wide-ranging issues: the role of evolutionary biology in the social sciences; the placebo effect; lie detectors; genocide; the scientific method. But he conveys a powerful and focused message: if we can learn to recognize and fight our own self-deception, we can avoid negative consequences at levels from the individual to the national, and live better lives.&#x201d;<i>&nbsp;</i><b><i>Scientific American, Guilty Planet</i> blog</b>&#x201c;Trivers is one of the greatest thinkers of our time.... <i>Folly of Fools</i> takes a refreshingly critical look at human behavior.... To fix some of the world&#x2019;s follies, we should lower the shield and better understand deception and our own self-deception by absorbing the wisdom, risky ideas, and generous admissions of his own foolishness in Robert Trivers&#x2019; <i>Folly of Fools</i>. The truth can hurt, but deceit can, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Tyler Cowen, <i>Marginal Revolution</i> blog<br></b>&#x201c;Brilliant, insightful, with occasional lapses of taste, quintessential Trivers, now the go-to book on its topic, recommended.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Kai Kupferschmidt, <i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The problem of why natural selection favors self-deception is as poorly understood as it is riveting. Robert Trivers uses examples from insects to international relations to guide us to the fundamental logic. The result is a startlingly original and important book that should start a global conversation on a topic of both scholarly and personal interest.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Richard Dawkins, emeritus Professor of the Public Understanding of Science, University of Oxford, and author of <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i></b>&#x201c;This is a remarkable book, by a uniquely brilliant scientist. Robert Trivers has a track record of producing highly original ideas, which have gone on to stimulate much research. His Darwinian theory of self-deception is arguably his most provocative and interesting idea so far. The book is enlivened by Trivers&#x2019; candid personal style, and is a pleasure to read. Strongly recommended.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Frans de Waal, C. H. Candler Professor, Emory University, and author of <i>Our Inner Ape</i> and <i>The Age of Empathy</i></b>&#x201c;Here a topic very few people think about, perhaps because the degree to which self-deception permeates our lives is itself subject to powerful denials. Robert Trivers, one of the brightest minds in evolutionary biology, leaves us little escape, however. No denying: an eye-opening read.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Science</i></b>&#x201c;Engaging .... disarmingly honest.... Trivers&#x2019;s book is a thoroughly good read.

What makes Trivers&#x2019; book unusual even among great books is the density of new ideas. Like other great popular press books in science, this book advances an important new idea in an entertaining and accessible manner. This book goes beyond that, however, by providing dozens of new hypotheses for those of us who have been laboring in this field for the last twenty years. In that sense, this book is not just exporting science to the lay public, but is also an important piece of scholarship.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>David Haig, Professor of Biology, Harvard University<br></b>&#x201c;This is an enjoyable, thought-provoking book on how our mind systematically creates distorted perceptions of reality and how these distort our presentation of self to others.

The father robin sat on a branch nearby, guarding his family. Tressa spotted raccoon tracks below and a blue jay eyeing the nest. &#x201c;Gran, how are we going to keep the egg safe?&#x201d;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to leave that one to the Creator,&#x201d; Gran said.Robins have built a nest on the window ledge at Grandmother&#x2019;s house! Tressa is thrilled&#x2015;and concerned. What will happen to the sky-blue egg laid by the mother robin? As more eggs appear, Tressa witnesses the daily drama of the robins&#x2019; nest and learns how God cares for all creatures.Besides watching the birds, there are Easter eggs to color. And there is a very special story to hear&#x2015;a tale of long ago about one small bird with a very big heart. How did the robin get its red breast? Tressa is about to find out as Gran tells her the story of the Easter robin.Brought to life with colorful, tender illustrations, The Story of the Easter Robin will captivate and teach your child about compassion and faith.</p><p><p>Dandi Daley Mackall loves God, children, words, and animals.

Dandi writes from rural Ohio, where she lives with her family, including horses, dogs, cats, and an occasional squirrel, deer, or raccoon.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>Two stories fold into one as this contemporary tale reaches back to the first Easter. Tressa is worried about the robin&#x2019;s eggs outside her window. And even though Gran tells her to trust the one who watches robins and sparrows, Tressa knows everything from weather to raccoons could mean trouble. To get her mind off the eggs outside, Gran brings Tressa inside to make Easter eggs the Pennsylvania Dutch way: blowing out the insides, dyeing them, and fashioning paper into wings, heads, and tails for the egg bodies. It is while they are working that Gran tells Tressa a story. At the time of the Crucifixion, it was the small brown robin that pulled a thorn from Jesus&#x2019; crown to spare him pain; the blood from the wound gave the bird its red breast. The next day, the baby robins have hatched, and Tressa knows whom to thank for their safety. Drawing from Pennsylvania Dutch tradition, this warm story incorporates intergenerational affection, religious faith, and the appeal of legends. Sturdy artwork brings all the elements together.

Drifting across the former land bridge between Siberia and Alaska, or following a now-drowned coast, hunting bands and family groups dispersed throughout the Americas, tolled by herds of game; flocks of migratory waterfowl; and bounty of fish, mollusks, and edible vegetation. The polished text follows this human flow, recording the adaptation of these ancient peoples to an enormous range of climatic and geographical diversity. Specific archaeological sites are examined, recording the development of agriculture and advanced technologies among some peoples, culminating in the flowering of strong nations and great empires. Other investigations determine the cultural growth of groups who clung to hunter/gatherer traditions. The author presents theories on migration patterns, dates, and technological developments, indicating whether they are widely accepted or hotly debated. This scholarly whole is accompanied by several maps, an index, and a time line of contemporary cultures and developments in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. There is also an extremely detailed 14-page bibliography listed chapter by chapter. Zallinger's strong, meticulous, sepia-tone artwork is informative as well as decorative, and are placed to complement the text. Large format, attractive illustrations, elegant type face on fine cream paper, and careful balance of text and illustration present The Earliest Americans as an inviting package that lives up to the expectations it engenders. --Patricia Manning, Eastchester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The experienced collaborators responsible for such popular and useful works as Baby Dinosaurs and Sharks have produced a fascinating chronological survey of the many civilizations that flourished in the Americas from 22,000 to 500 years ago, or before European contact. With her customary care, Sattler clearly sets out several of the most established theories about who the earliest Americans were, where they came from and when they arrived. She explains how anthropologists and archeologists gather information from fossils and other remains, and she contrasts various aspects of diverse ancient American civilizations with those of Europe, Asia and Africa, discussing, for example, shelter, agriculture, customs and technology. The late Sattler's writing, while reliable and well sourced, may be a bit more dry here than in her previous works; however, Zallinger's highly detailed pencil drawings, maps and charts consistently amplify the text. Those looking for information on civilizations generally not well represented in children's nonfiction will find this involving, and even adults will appreciate its chronological charts, extensive bibliography and comprehensive index.

The girl known only as Brat has no family, no home, and no future until she meets Jane the Midwife and becomes her apprentice. As she helps the sharp-tempered Jane deliver babies, Brat--who renames herself Alyce--gains knowledge, confidence, and the courage to want something from life: "A full belly, a contented heart, and a place in this world." Medieval village life makes a lively backdrop for the funny, poignant story of how Alyce gets what she wants. A concluding note discusses midwifery past and present. A Newbery Medal book.</p><p>Karen Cushman likes to write with her tongue firmly planted in her cheek, and her feisty female characters firmly planted in history. In <i>The Midwife's Apprentice</i>, which earned the 1996 Newbery Medal, this makes a winning combination for children and adult readers alike. Like her award-winning book <i>Catherine, Called Birdy</i>, the story takes place in medieval England. This time our protagonist is Alyce, who rises from the dung heap (literally) of homelessness and namelessness to find a station in life--apprentice to the crotchety, snaggletoothed midwife Jane Sharp. On Alyce's first solo outing as a midwife, she fails to deliver. Instead of facing her ignorance, Alyce chooses to run from failure--never a good choice. Disappointingly, Cushman does not offer any hardships or internal wrestling to warrant Alyce's final epiphanies, and one of the book's climactic insights is when Alyce discovers that lo and behold she is actually pretty! Still, Cushman redeems her writing, as always, with historical accuracy, saucy dialogue, fast-paced action, and plucky, original characters that older readers will eagerly devour.

The book's chronological but unusual format--it consists almost entirely of freestanding quotes, without transitional narration--works well. Sources include Graham's family, members of the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and actor Peter Coyote; Graham, shrewd and outspoken, tells anecdotes of his own and never misses a chance to rebut his illustrious colleagues who reminisce here. His tale is the stuff of legends: a Jew born in Germany in 1931 and orphaned soon after, he was evacuated to France in 1939 and sent to the U.S. in 1941. He lived with a foster family in the Bronx, working as a waiter and cabbie until he found his calling as a rock impresario in 1960s San Francisco.

Jasper Johns&#39;s recent pieces, with their puns, optical illusions and embedded images have attracted considerable critical attention. Crichton, who knows Johns and has collected his work for over 20 years, here offers intimate glimpses of the artist&#39;s potent and seemingly contradictory aspects. Accompanying the text is a whole portfolio of illustrations, providing an overview of his work as painter, sculptor and printmaker. Over 200 works are reproduced, including colour and foldout reproductions.</p><p>Johns can easily lay claim to the title of greatest living American artist, and polymath novelist/doctor Crichton here provides an indispensable overview of his career. Crichton has substantially expanded and revised his 1977 monograph on Johns to cover his latest work. Drawing on interviews with the often laconic artist as well as commentary from art historians, dealers, and friends, Crichton sketches Johns's creative processes and the development of his style. This accessible portrait of the artist's work is both insightful and enlightening, furnishing context for Johns's place in contemporary art. The extensive color and duotone photographs provide a nearly complete summation of Johns's career from the early 1950s through the present. Highly recommended for all art collections and larger public libraries.<br><i>Martin R. Kalfatovic, Smithsonian Inst.

The next he&#39;s a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, as he soon learns, is a backwater, just a pebble in the sky, despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it&#39;s the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil--so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty. Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two. This is young Isaac Asimov&#39;s first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation series. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.</p><p><p>Born in Russia, <b>Isaac Asimov</b> lived in Boston and in New York City for most of his life. He died in 1992 at the age of seventy-two.</p><p>Chapter 1<br>Two minutes before he disappeared forever from the face of the Earth he knew, Joseph Schwartz strolled along the pleasant streets of suburban Chicago quoting Browning to himself.<br>In a sense this was strange, since Schwartz would scarcely have impressed any casual passerby as the Browning-quoting type. He looked exactly what he was: a retired tailor, thoroughly lacking in what the sophisticates of today call a &#x201c;formal education.&#x201d; Yet he had expended much of an inquisitive nature upon random reading. By the sheer force of indiscriminate voracity, he had gleaned a smattering of practically everything, and by means of a trick memory had managed to keep it all straight.<br>For instance, he had read Robert Browning&#x2019;s Rabbi Ben Ezra twice when he was younger, so, of course, knew it by heart. Most of it was obscure to him, but those first three lines had become one with the beating of his heart these last few years. He intoned them to himself, deep within the silent fortress of his mind, that very sunny and very bright early summer day of 1949:<br>&#x201c;Grow old along with me!<br>The best is yet to be,<br>The last of life, for which the first was made...&#x201d;<br>Schwartz felt that to its fullness. After the struggles of youth in Europe and those of his early manhood in the United States, the serenity of a comfortable old age was pleasant. With a house of his own and money of his own, he could, and did, retire. With a wife in good health, two daughters safely married, a grandson to soothe these last best years, what had he to worry about?<br>There was the atom bomb, of course, and this somewhat lascivious talk about World War III, but Schwartz was a believer in the goodness of human nature. He didn&#x2019;t think there would be another war. He didn&#x2019;t think Earth would ever see again the sunlike hell of an atom exploded in anger. So he smiled tolerantly at the children he passed and silently wished them a speedy and not too difficult ride through youth to the peace of the best that was yet to be.<br>He lifted his foot to step over a Raggedy Ann doll smiling through its neglect as it lay there in the middle of the walk, a foundling not yet missed. He had not quite put his foot down again... In another part of Chicago stood the Institute for Nuclear Research, in which men may have had theories upon the essential worth of human nature but were half ashamed of them, since no quantitative instrument had yet been designed to measure it. When they thought about it, it was often enough to wish that some stroke from heaven would prevent human nature (and damned human ingenuity) from turning every innocent and interesting discovery into a deadly weapon.<br>Yet, in a pinch, the same man who could not find it in his conscience to curb his curiosity into the nuclear studies that might someday kill half of Earth would risk his life to save that of an unimportant fellow man.<br>It was the blue glow behind the chemist&#x2019;s back that first attracted the attention of Dr. Smith.<br>He peered at it as he passed the half-open door. The chemist, a cheerful youngster, was whistling as he tipped up a volumetric flask, in which the solution had already been made up to volume. A white powder tumbled lazily through the liquid, dissolving in its own good time. For a moment that was all, and then Dr. Smith&#x2019;s instinct, which had stopped him in the first place, stirred him to action.<br>He dashed inside, snatched up a yardstick, and swept the contents of the desk top to the floor. There was the deadly hiss of molten metal. Dr. Smith felt a drop of perspiration slip to the end of his nose.<br>The youngster stared blankly at the concrete floor along which the silvery metal had already frozen in thin splash marks. They still radiated heat strongly.<br>He said faintly, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith shrugged. He wasn&#x2019;t quite himself either. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. You tell me.... What&#x2019;s been doing here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s been doing here,&#x201d; the chemist yammered. &#x201c;That was just a sample of crude uranium. I&#x2019;m making an electrolytic copper determination.... I don&#x2019;t know what could have happened.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever happened, young man, I can tell you what I saw. That platinum crucible was showing a corona. Heavy radiation was taking place. Uranium, you say?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but crude uranium, and that isn&#x2019;t dangerous. I mean, extreme purity is one of the most important qualifications for fission, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He touched his tongue to his lips quickly. &#x201c;Do you think it was fission, sir? It&#x2019;s not plutonium, and it wasn&#x2019;t being bombarded.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; said Dr. Smith thoughtfully, &#x201c;it was below the critical mass. Or, at least, below the critical masses we think we know.&#x201d; He stared at the soapstone desk, at the burned and blistered paint of the cabinets and the silvery streaks along the concrete floor. &#x201c;Yet uranium melts at about 1800 degrees Centigrade, and nuclear phenomena are not so well known that we can afford to talk too glibly. After all, this place must be fairly saturated with stray radiations. When the metal cools, young man, it had better be chipped up, collected, and thoroughly analyzed.&#x201d;<br>He gazed thoughtfully about him, then stepped to the opposite wall and felt uneasily at a spot about shoulder height.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; he said to the chemist. &#x201c;Has this always been here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, sir?&#x201d; The young man stepped up nervously and glanced at the spot the older man indicated. It was a tiny hole, one that might have been made by a thin nail driven into the wall and withdrawn&#x2014;but driven through plaster and brick for the full thickness of the building&#x2019;s wall, since daylight could be seen through it.<br>The chemist shook his head, &#x201c;I never saw that before. But I never looked for it, either, sir.&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith said nothing. He stepped back slowly and passed the thermostat, a parallelopiped of a box made out of thin sheet iron. The water in it moved swirlingly as the stirrer turned in motor-driven monomania, while the electric bulbs beneath the water, serving as heaters, flicked on and off distractingly, in time with the clicking of the mercury relay.<br>&#x201c;Well, then, was this here?&#x201d; And Dr. Smith scraped gently with his fingernail at a spot near the top of the wide side of the thermostat. It was a neat, tiny circle drilled through the metal. The water did not quite reach it.<br>The chemist&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;No, sir, that wasn&#x2019;t there ever before. I&#x2019;ll guarantee that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm. Is there one on the other side?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be damned. I mean, yes, sir!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right, come round here and sight through the holes.... Shut the thermostat off, please. Now stay there.&#x201d; He placed his finger on the hole in the wall. &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; he called out.<br>&#x201c;I see your finger, sir. Is that where the hole is?&#x201d;<br>Dr. Smith did not answer. He said, with a calmness he was far from feeling, &#x201c;Sight through in the other direction.... Now what do you see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the place where the crucible with the uranium was standing. You&#x2019;re looking at the exact place, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Reluctantly, &#x201c;I think so, sir.&#x201d;&lt;</p></p><h2>The Door into Summer</h2><p>Dan Davis was tricked by an unscrupulous business partner and a greedy fiancee into spending thirty years in suspended animation just when he was on the verge of a success beyond his wildest dreams.

She writes of the Limberlost which was a wetlands in northern Indiana. In &#34;Freckles&#34;, she tells the story of a young man, damaged physically, who becomes the better man in Horation Alger-style through pluck, determination, and honesty. &#34;Freckles&#34; gives us not only the story and romance of this boy and his &#34;Swamp Angel&#34;, but delights us with the vision of the wildlife and the plantlife of a struggling, at-risk natural resource.</p><p>In this book a homeless waif finds his deliverance in the primeval Limberlost swamp. Maimed and abandoned as an infant, Freckles seeks a chance to prove his worth. He is given that opportunity as the guard of the precious timber of the Limberlost. In his stewardship of the woods, he finds happiness in the companionship of the birds and other wild creatures and in the love of the beautiful Swamp Angel. This moving story of courage and virtue will warm the hearts of young and old.Gene Stratton-Porter (1863 -1924) was an American author, amateur naturalist, wildlife photographer, and one of the earliest women to form a movie studio and production company. She wrote some best-selling novels and well-received columns in national magazines, such as McCalls. Her works were translated into several languages, including Braille, and Stratton-Porter was estimated to have 50 million readers around the world. She used her position and income as a well-known author to support conservation of Limberlost Swamp and other wetlands in the state of Indiana. Her novel A Girl of the Limberlost was adapted four times as a film, most recently in 1990 in a made-for-TV version.</p><h2>Task Force Blue (Rogue Warrior)</h2><p>When a band of terrorists breaches the Pentagon&#39;s security, Marcinko and his elite SEAL team, under the pressure of a murder charge, must stop the terrorists from destroying the U.S. government in order to establish their own brand of law.</p><p><p><b>AS A U.S. NAVY SEAL, RICHARD MARCINKO KNEW NO LIMITS -- AS THE <i>ROGUE WARRIOR</i>, HE OBEYS NO RULES!</b> </p><p>SpecWar: deep-cover commando operations conducted with absolute secrecy and total ruthlessness by the world's most deadly counterterrorist units. No one knows SpecWar better than Richard Marcinko, and he's proven it time and again. The revelations in his #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling autobiography, <i>Rogue Warrior</i>, brought real-life SpecWar combat out in the open. But, bound by government restrictions on classified information, there was only one way to tell the whole story: fiction. After two more explosive <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers -- <i>Rogue Warrior: Red Cell</i> and <i>Rogue Warrior: Green Team</i> -- the <i>Rogue Warrior</i> returns in a raw, authentic novel of terrorism striking at the heart of the American government and military.... </p><p>Moving slowly, steadily across the tarmac through the driving Florida rain, the Rogue Warrior and his team of SEALs have been called into action. Mission: storm a hijacked 727 sitting on a Key West airstrip and rescue the Secretary of the Navy. In a flash of high-tech explosives and automatic gunfire, a hostage is killed -- and Marcinko will be the one to pay. Facing a court martial and permanent removal from the Navy, the Rogue Warrior has one more call to answer, from an ultrasecret operative inside the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). </p><p>America's worst nightmare has become a reality. The hijackers' roots run deep in U.S. soil: Americans willing to kill Americans to create a government in their own fanatical image. The Pentagon's security has been breached: the arsenal of democracy raided. The DIA needs someone to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure, circumventing the Navy and the FBI. They need Marcinko and his elite SEAL contingent, Task Force Blue. </p><p>Inspired and funded by a politically motivated independent billionaire, the enemy has become a force of right-wing militias and extremists, radical drug gangs, and fundamentalist terrorists -- but they have yet to face an adversary like the Rogue Warrior. Accused of murder and pursued by the FBI, operating underground to maneuver through a political, military, and bureaucratic minefield, the Rogue Warrior is right where he wants to be. And, faithful to his ultimate Commandment of SpecWar, there are no rules -- Marcinko will win at all costs.</p>In their third outing, Marcinko and his roguish warriors do violent, imaginative battle with America's home-front enemies. Following retirement as a US Navy SEAL, Marcinko embarked on an active if fictive career as a handyman for the military (his vastly entertaining exploits are chronicled in such blood-and- thunder opera as Rogue Warrior: Green Team, 1995). This time around, the salty Vietnam vet and his handpicked crew are detailed to staunch the illicit flow of heavy weapons and ammunition from government arsenals. Thanks to the cyberspace talents of a young petty officer who can hack into Pentagon computers, Task Force Blue soon learns its ageless leader is the designated fall guy in a power struggle pitting would-be usurpers against constituted authority. Despite the best efforts of their establishment foes, Marcinko and his merry men track a truckload of stolen arms from Detroit to Tampa, from whence it is shipped to an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. They storm the offshore drilling platform, which is owned by billionaire L.C. Strawhouse, and learn that the rig is used to supply ordnance to disaffected militia groups and drug gangs throughout the country. Back on dry land, the seagoing irregulars also discover that the ultraconservative Strawhouse (who tries to enlist Marcinko in his mad cause) has been equipping domestic terrorists in hopes their lethal rampages might permit a reactive putsch that could put him in the White House. While by no means taken with the incumbent chief executive or his wimpy underlings, Marcinko pursues the man who would be America's king to a heavily guarded command post in the southern California desert. In a climactic confrontation inside the fortress, he exposes and foils Strawhouse's sinister plot before dispatching its architect in decidedly imaginative fashion. Another walk on the wild side with the Marcinko mob. (Military Book Club main selection; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

All he has left are his diary entries recalling Clio, a perfect love who died under mysterious circumstances, and a house that may contain the secrets to Eric&#x2019;s prior life. But there may be more to this story, or it may be a different story altogether. With the help of allies found on the fringes of society, Eric embarks on an edge-of-your-seat journey to uncover the truth about himself and to escape the predatory forces that threaten to consume him. Moving with the pace of a superb thriller, <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i> has sparked the imaginations of readers around the world and is one of the most talked-about novels in years.<br></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, March 2007</b>: Not since <i>Fight Club</i> have a I read a book that sizzled with such fierce originality and searing vision as Steven Hall's electrifying debut novel, <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i>. It's a twisting, trippy thriller that tears through the landscape of language, revealing the lurking terrors uncovered in every letter of the written word. Steven Hall swims in the same surreal waters as pop-culture pioneers David Lynch and Michel Gondry, and <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i> deserves to be shelved somewhere between <i>Trainspotting</i> and <i>Life of Pi</i>. It pulls you under like a riptide, leaving you exhausted, exhilarated, and gasping for air. <p> But don't just take our word for it. We asked Audrey Niffenegger, one of the most creative contemporary writers working today, to share with readers her take on Steven Hall's debut novel, <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i>. Check out her exclusive Amazon guest review below. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i><br> </p><p> <br><b>Guest Reviewer: Audrey Niffenegger</b><br> </p><p><b>Audrey Niffenegger is a professor in the Interdisciplinary Books Arts MFA Program at the Columbia College Chicago Center for Book and Paper Arts. A visual artist, she shows her artwork at Printworks Gallery in Chicago. <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i>, her first novel, was an international bestseller and was one of Amazon.com's Best Books of 2003. It won several awards and is being made into a major motion picture. Her visual novels, <i>The Three Incestuous Sisters</i> and <i>The Adventuress</i>, were recently published by Harry N. Abrams. Miss Niffenegger is currently hard at work on her second novel, <i>Her Fearful Symmetry</i>, a ghost story set in London's Highgate Cemetery.</b></p> <p>Eric Sanderson has lost his memory, his girl, his life as he once knew it. His pre-amnesiac self is sending him letters, a sort of correspondence course on how to be Eric Sanderson. Unfortunately, this previous self didn't really have it all together either. This is too bad, because the source of all the trouble is a conceptual shark, a Ludovician shark, no less. Soon Eric is on the run, trying to piece it all together and find true love before his mind gets wiped by the shark for the twelfth and probably final time. </p><p> Steven Hall is an inventive, funny and extremely smart writer. I am a letterpress printer and a typophile, and I was drawn to his book because of the typography: <i>The Raw Shark Texts</i> is riddled with typographic games, codes, a flip book, and a boatload of very elegant plot devices that hinge on collisions between the Information Age and the imagination. At one point Eric and Scout, his guide/love interest, are speeding away from the conceptual shark on a motorbike. Scout eludes the shark by exploding a letter bomb, a bomb made out of old metal type; the type diverts the shark into a stream of random letterforms. At this I practically fell off the couch with admiration. </p><p> There's plenty to groove on in <i>The Raw Sharks Texts</i> even if you're not a type maven. There's echoes of Cyberpunk, Borges, Auster; there is adventure on the high seas, lost love, an exploration of what it means to be human in the age of intelligent machines. <i>The Raw Sharks Texts</i> is huge fun, and I gleefully recommend it. <i>--Audrey Niffenegger</i><br> </p> <br><p>Steven Hall was born in 1975 in Derbyshire, England. He has produced a number of plays, music videos, concrete prose/conceptual art pieces and short stories, including &#x201c;Stories for a Phone Book,&#x201d; featured in <em>New Writing 13</em>.

The brief introductory prayer sentences are from various sources - the Bible and traditional prayers of the church or of well-known spiritual writers. The spiritual readings come from eleven of Father Keatings books and one audiotape, with a month's worth of readings derived from each work. Each day's entry concludes with a brief selection from the Bible, or Lectio Divina.</p></p><p>Father Thomas Keating is known throughout the world as an exponent, teacher, and writer on contemplative prayer. A Cistercian (Trappist) monk of St. Benedict's Monastery, Snowmass, Colorado, he is a founder of the Centering Prayer Movement and of Contemplative Outreach. He is the author of numerous books, particularly of the trilogy Open Mind, Open Heart; Invitation to Love; and The Mystery of Christ. Among his most recent books is The Daily Reader for Contemplative Living, compiled by S. Stephanie Iachetta.S. Stephanie Iachetta, who lives in Rye, NY, holds a B.A. and M.S.E. from the College of New Rochelle and an M.B.A. from Iona College Hagen School of Business. She previously coedited <em>What is Healing Prayer All About?</em> with Father Peter McCall and Maryanne Lacy."Some books, like some people, can be pronounced 'wonderful' after only a brief encounter; more meetings simply reinforce our initial judgment. This is that sort of book, an ideal vade mecum for those who desire to retrieve the wonderfulness so often obscured by the distracting demands of our ordinary routines, the sheer dailiness of our daily lives that dulls our spiritual sensitivities. Here then is a wake-up call we need to 'seize the day' once again by attending to the promptings within our hearts and allowing the most gentle of companions to accompany us through it." -George W. Hunt, S.J., former editor-in-chief of America (George W.

I. Gurdjieff</b> intended to "destroy, mercilessly . . . the beliefs and views about everything existing in the world." This novel beautifully brings to life the visions of humanity for which Gurdjieff has become esteemed. Beelzebub, a man of worldly (and other-worldly) wisdom, shares with his grandson the anecdotes, personal philosophies, and lessons learned from his own life.The reader is given a detailed discussion of all matters physical, natural, and spiritual, from the creation of the cosmos to man's teleological purpose in the universe. This edition of <b>Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson</b>--the first single-volume paperback to appear in English--restores the original, authoritative translation.</p><p>Editors' Note <p>Gurdjieff wrote <i>Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson</i> from 1924 through 1931, and continued in later years to make significant revisions. Before his death in 1949 he entrusted the book and his other writings to Jeanne de Salzmann, his closest pupil, with instructions for future publication. Mme. de Salzmann had followed Gurdjieff for over 30 years and played a central role in his decision in the l940s to organize the practice of his teaching. </p><p>Gurdjieff wrote <i>Beelzebub's Tales</i> in Russian and Armenian, and the original manuscript was typed and revised in Russian. An English translation was produced in successive steps at the Prieur�. It consisted initially of a word-by-word interlinear translation with each word in English placed above the corresponding Russian word in the typescript. Reworked by different pupils at different times, the translation was finally edited by the well-known author and editor A.R. Orage, mostly in New York. Although he worked closely with Russian speakers and, indeed, Gurdjieff himself, Orage knew no Russian and was unable to read Gurdjieff's original text. </p><p>The English version was first published in 1950, just a few months after Gurdjieff died. He had overruled objections that the translation needed more work, insisting that the time had come to launch his ideas into the mainstream of Western thinking. As the English text was the initial publication of the book in any language, it was assumed by many readers to have been written or specifically approved by Gurdjieff. Although a prefatory note stated that the original was written in Russian and Armenian, the significance of this was easily disregarded in the absence of a published edition of the original Russian text. The note also stated that the author had personally directed the translation, and Gurdjieff had often been present when the translation was read aloud to English-speaking pupils and visitors. </p><p>What few readers knew was that, in fact, all of Gurdjieff's work in completing the book was in Russian. His spoken English, like his spoken French, was effective and memorably colorful for his purposes as a teacher in conversation with his pupils, but since his arrival in Western Europe in the early 1920s, he had not taken the time to master either language. He could not have judged, much less approved, the English text and had to rely on Mme. de Salzmann, who was fluent in Russian and English, for reassurance that the meaning was preserved. Gurdjieff did not approve the writing style of the English translation. </p><p>Although before his death Gurdjieff had insisted on immediate publication, he reportedly acknowledged that the English book was a "rough diamond" and asked Mme. de Salzmann to revise it at a later time. Her first priority was to prepare the French edition based on the Russian manuscript, a task that was not completed until 1956. Thereafter, she began work with selected American pupils to revise the English language version. The primary aim was to bring it closer in substance to the Russian text, using the widely admired and well accepted French edition as a model. A secondary but important aim was to have it correspond more faithfully in style to Gurdjieff's Russian writing, particularly to make it as clear and understandable as the Russian. Mme. de Salzmann herself worked for a number of years with the editorial team and then left them to complete the project. The revision, despite interruptions, was finally completed more than 30 years later.</p><b>G. I. Gurdjieff</b> was born in 1887 in Alexandropol. After studying with spiritual masters in the Near East and Asia, he founded the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in France.</p><h2>Up Country</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER <br><br>"Much more than a blood-and-guts thriller...An insightful, moving, and sensitive look at what the war did to a country, its people, and its enemies." - <i>Orlando Sentinel </i></b><i><br></i><br>Former army homicide investigator Paul Brenner has just gotten used to the early retirement forced on him after the disastrous end of his last case when his old commanding officer asks him to return for one final mission: investigate a murder that took place in wartime Vietnam thirty years before. Brenner reluctantly accepts out of curiosity and loyalty...and maybe a touch of boredom. He won't be bored for long. <br><br>Back in Vietnam, Brenner meets expatriate Susan Weber, a woman as exotic, sensual, and dangerous as the nation of her voluntary exile. Brenner is plunged into a world of corruption, lethal double cross, and haunted memories-as he's suddenly thrust back into a war that neither he nor his country ever really stopped fighting.<br><br></p><p>In <i>Up Country</i>, Nelson DeMille cannily revives the army career of Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, the cynical, hardworking Criminal Investigation Division man who was forcibly retired after solving the high-profile killing in <i>The General's Daughter</i>. Brenner's called back to investigate the murder of a young army lieutenant by his captain. The catch is, the crime took place during the heat of the Tet Offensive, and the only living witness was a North Vietnamese soldier who described the incident in a 30-year-old letter that has only recently come to light. Soon Brenner, a Vietnam vet, is on an ostensible nostalgia tour of his old stomping grounds. The trip immediately turns dangerous as he heads "up country" to search for the letter writer, accompanied by a gorgeous American businesswoman, who's hiding more than even the smartest CID officer could imagine. <p> DeMille, who saw his own tour of duty in Vietnam (and even found a letter on a dead Vietnamese soldier), intersperses historical facts and chilling political possibilities with enough local color to provide some serious flashbacks for his fellow veterans. To non-vets the book may seem very long, but the payoff at the end is worth a couple hundred extra pages. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Nelson DeMille is a former U.S. Army lieutenant who served in Vietnam and is the author of nineteen acclaimed novels, including the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Night Fall, Plum Island, The Gate House, The Lion</i>, <i>The Panther</i> and <i>Radiant Angel</i>. His other <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers include <i>The Charm School, Word of Honor, The Gold Coast, Spencerville, The Lion's Game, Up Country, Wild Fire</i>, and <i>The General's Daughter</i>, the last of which was a major motion picture.

Many of us discover ways to love our neighbor, but few achieve intimacy with God. Why? <i>Because we don't know how to prepare ourselves properly to reach this exalted goal</i>.</p><p>In these pages, Father Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalen lays out for us a time-tested path toward achieving complete intimacy with God, the path first mapped out centuries ago by the Church's acclaimed master of the contemplative life, St. John of the Cross (1542-1591).</p><p>St. John showed that God hungers for union with each of us but also requires arduous efforts on our part, the many details of which Father Gabriel explains in these enlightening pages.</p><p>Do you perceive holiness as an unattainable goal for you?</p><p>Or is fear of the fatigue of such an effort holding you back?</p><p>Absorb this book, and allow gentle St. John to take you by the hand and lead you as he has led so many others to true intimacy with our Lord.</p><p></p></p><p>Father Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalen, O.C.D. (1893-1953), was a Discalced Carmelite priest, confessor and spiritual director.He was an expert in the writings of venerated Carmelite Mystics such as St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross. For the last decade of his life Fr. Gabriel was the spiritual director for the Discalced Carmelite nuns of the Monastery of St. Joseph in Rome. It was with their assistance that he compiled his writings and mystical insight, arranging his material to correspond with the liturgical year, while following the ascent of the soul to transforming union with God.</p><h2>Split Image (Chief Jesse Stone, 9)</h2><p><b>Family ties prove deadly in this brilliant Jesse Stone novel from&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Robert B.

Yet his focus is not on his own story but on the common impact of God s Word as law and gospel on its hearers.

And all that pastorally as comfort to people with a bad conscience! By the way that he teaches God s Word, he arrests our attention, surprises us mentally with many new insights, energizes us spiritually, and gladdens our hearts. Its teaching drives away the cloying stench of decadent piety and replaces it with the joyful aroma of Christ and His fragrant, life-giving message. --Dr. John Kleinig</p><h2>Hemp Happy: 31 Fun Jewelry Items to Make and Wear Today!

(Salman Rushdie, commenting on my book <i>god Is Not Great</i>, remarked rather mordantly that the chief problem with its title was a lack of economy: that it was in other words exactly one word too long.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But whatever one&#x2019;s ontology may be, it will always seem tempting to believe that everything must have a first cause or, if nothing quite as grand as that, at the very least a definite beginning. And on that point I have no vagueness or indecision. I do know a little of how I came to be in two minds. And <i>this </i>is how it begins with me:<br>&nbsp;<br>I am standing on a ferry-boat that is crossing a lovely harbor. I have since learned many versions and variations of the word &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; but let&#x2019;s say that a brilliant if slightly harsh sunshine illuminates a cerulean sky-vault and an azure sea and also limns the way in which these two textures collide and reflect. The resulting tinge of green is in lambent contrast with the darker vegetation on the hillsides and makes an almost blinding combination when, allied with those discrepant yet melding blues, it hits the white buildings that reach down to the edge of the water. As a flash of drama and beauty and seascape and landscape, it&#x2019;s as good an inaugural memory as one could wish.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since this little voyage is occurring in about 1952 and I have been born in 1949, I have no means of appreciating that this is the Grand Harbor at Valletta, the capital of the tiny island-state of Malta and one of the finest Baroque and Renaissance cities of Europe. A jewel set in the sea between Sicily and Libya, it has been for centuries a place of the two-edged sword between the Christian and Muslim worlds. Its population is so overwhelmingly Roman Catholic that there are, within the walled city, a great plethora of ornate churches, the cathedral being decorated by the murals of Caravaggio himself, that seductive votary of the higher wickedness. The island withstood one of the longest Turkish sieges in the history of &#x201c;Christendom.&#x201d; But the Maltese tongue is a dialect version of the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb and is the only Semitic language to be written in a Latin script. If you happen to attend a Maltese Catholic church during Mass, you will see the priest raising the Communion Host and calling on &#x201c;Allah,&#x201d; because this after all is the local word for &#x201c;god.&#x201d; My first memory, in other words, is of a ragged and jagged, but nonetheless permeable and charming, frontier between two cultures and civilizations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am, at this stage, far too secure and confident to register anything of the kind. (If I speak a few phrases of Maltese, it is not with a view to becoming bilingual or multicultural but in order to address my priest-ridden nannies and the kitchen maids with their huge broods of children. This was the place where I first learned to see the picture of Catholicism as one of plump shepherds and lean sheep.) * Malta is effectively a British colony &#x2014; its most heroic recent chapter the withstanding of a hysterical aerial bombardment by Hitler and Mussolini &#x2014; and it has remained a solid possession of the Royal Navy, in which my father proudly serves, ever since the Napoleonic Wars. Much more to the immediate point, I am standing on the deck of this vessel in company with my mother, who holds my hand when I desire it and also lets me scamper off to explore if I insist.<br>&nbsp;<br>* Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of &#x201c;the flock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, all things being considered, not too shaky a start. I am well-dressed and well-fed, with a full head of hair and a slender waist, and operating in a context of startling architectural and natural beauty, and full of <i>brio </i>and self-confidence, and on a boat in the company of a beautiful woman who loves me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t call her by this name at the time, but &#x201c;Yvonne&#x201d; is the echo with which I most piercingly and yearningly recall her memory to me. After all, it <i>was </i>her name, and it was what her friends called her, and my shell-like ear detected quite early on a difference between this and the various comfortable Nancys and Joans and Ethels and Marjories who &#x2014; sterling types all &#x2014; tended to be the spouses and helpmeets of my father&#x2019;s brother-officers. <i>Yvonne </i>. A bit of class there: a bit of style. A touch or dash of garlic and olive and rosemary to sweeten the good old plain English loaf from which, the fact must be faced, I was also sliced. But more of this when I come to Commander Hitchens. I mustn&#x2019;t pretend to remember more than I really do, but I am very aware that it makes a great difference to have had, in early life, a passionate lady in one&#x2019;s own corner.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, noticing that I had skipped the baby-talk stage and gone straight to speaking in complete sentences (even if sometimes derivative ones such as, according to family legend, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all go and have a drink at the club&#x201d;), she sat me down one day and produced an elementary phonetic reading-book, or what used to be known to the humble as &#x201c;a speller.&#x201d; This concerned the tedious adventures of a woodland elf or goblin called Lob-agob (his name helpfully subdivided in this way) but, by the time I was done with it, I was committed for life to having some sort of reading matter within reach at all times, and was always to be ahead of my class in reading-age.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this period, however, our family had left Malta and been posted to the much more austere surroundings of Rosyth, another naval base on the east coast of Scotland. I think Malta may have been a sort of high point for Yvonne: all British people were a cut above the rest in a semicolony and there was that club for cocktails and even the chance of some local &#x201c;help.&#x201d; Not that she longed to wallow in idleness but, having endured a girlhood of scarcity, slump, and then war, she couldn&#x2019;t have minded a bit of color and Mediterranean dash and may well have felt she&#x2019;d earned it. (On our way back from Malta we stopped for a few hours at Nice: her and my first taste of the Riviera. I remember how happy she looked.) The grayness and drabness of &#x201c;married quarters&#x201d; in drizzle-flogged Fifeshire must have hit her quite hard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But she and my father had first been thrown together precisely because of drizzle and austerity, and the grim, grinding war against the Nazis. He, a career Navy man, had been based at Scapa Flow, the huge, cold-water sound in the Orkney Islands which helped establish and maintain British control over the North Sea. She was a volunteer in the Women&#x2019;s Royal Naval Service or, in the parlance of the day, a &#x201c;Wren.&#x201d; (My most cherished photograph of her shows her in uniform.) After a short wartime courtship they had been married in early April 1945, not long before Adolf Hitler had shoved a gun into his own (apparently halitosis-reeking) mouth. One young and eager girl from a broken Jewish home in Liverpool, wed to one man twelve years her senior from a sternly united if somewhat repressed Baptist family in Portsmouth. Wartime was certainly full of such improvised unions, in which probably both at first counted themselves fortunate, but I know for a fact that while my father never stopped considering himself lucky, my mother soon ceased to do so. She also decided, for a reason that I believe I can guess, to engage in the not-so-small deception of not mentioning to anyone in the Hitchens family that she was of Jewish descent.<br>&nbsp;<br>She herself had wanted to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as English after noticing some slight unpleasantness being visited on my grandmother, who in the 1930s toiled in the millinery business. And Yvonne could pass, too, as a light brunette with hazel-ish eyes and (always to my fancy and imagination) a &#x201c;French&#x201d; aspect. But more to the point, I now feel sure, she did not want either me or my brother to be taxed with <i>die Judenfrage </i>&#x2014; the Jewish question. What I do not know is quite what this concealment or reticence cost her. What I can tell you something about is what it meant for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>The paradox was this: in postwar Britain as in Britain at all other times, there was only one tried and tested form of social mobility. The firstborn son (at least) had to be educated at a private school, with an eventual view to attending a decent university. But school fees were high, and the shoals of class and accent and social position somewhat difficult for first-timers to navigate. Neither of my parents had been to college. One of my earliest coherent memories is of sitting in my pajamas at the top of the stairs, eavesdropping on a domestic argument. It was an easy enough one to follow. Yvonne wanted me to go to a fee-paying school. My father &#x2014; &#x201c;The Commander&#x201d; as we sometimes ironically and affectionately called him &#x2014; made the heavy but obvious objection that it was well beyond our means. Yvonne was having none of this. &#x201c;If there is going to be an upper class in this country,&#x201d; she stated with decision, &#x201c;then Christopher is going to be in it.&#x201d; I may not have the words exactly right &#x2014; could she have said &#x201c;ruling class&#x201d; or &#x201c;Establishment,&#x201d; terms that would then have been opaque to me? &#x2014; but the purport was very clear. And, from my hidden seat in the gallery, I silently applauded. Thus a further paradox discloses itself: my mother was much less British than my father but wanted above all for me to be an English gentleman. (You, dear reader, be the judge of how well <i>that </i>worked out.) And, though she wanted to keep me near, she needed to argue hotly for my sake that I be sent away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I registered this contradiction very acutely as, alternating between the beams and smiles of maternal encouragement and the hot tears of separation, she escorted me to my boarding school at the age of eight. I shall always be slightly sorry that I didn&#x2019;t make more of an effort to pretend that I was desolated, too. I knew I would miss Yvonne but I suppose by then I&#x2019;d had the essential experience of being loved without ever being spoiled. I was eager to get on with it. And at the school, which I had already visited as a prospective boarder, there could be found a library with shelves that seemed inexhaustible. There was nothing like that at our house, and Yvonne had taught me to love books. The cruelest thing I ever did, at the end of my first term away from home, was to come home for Christmas and address her as &#x201c;Mrs. Hitchens.&#x201d; I shan&#x2019;t forget her shocked face. It was the enforced etiquette to address all females at the school, from masters&#x2019; wives to staff, in this way. But I still suspect myself of having committed a mean little attention-getting subterfuge.<br>&nbsp;<br>This perhaps helps explain the gradual diminution of my store of memory of Yvonne: from the ages of eight to eighteen I was to be away from home for most of the year and the crucial rites of passage, from the pains of sexual maturity to the acquisition of friends, enemies, and an education, took place outside the bonds of family. Nonetheless, I always somehow knew how she was, and could generally guess what I didn&#x2019;t know, or what was to be inferred from between the lines of her weekly letters.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was a very good man and a worthy and honest and hardworking one, but he bored her, as did much of the remainder of her life. &#x201c;The one unforgivable sin,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;is to be boring.&#x201d; What she wanted was the metropolis, with cocktail parties and theater trips and smart friends and witty conversation, such as she had once had as a young thing in prewar Liverpool, where she&#x2019;d lived near Penny Lane and briefly known people like the madly gay Frank Hauser, later director of the Oxford Playhouse, and been introduced by a boyfriend to the work of the handsome Ulster poet Louis MacNeice, contemporary of Auden and author of <i>Autumn Journal </i>and (her favorite) <i>The Earth Compels </i>. What she got instead was provincial life in a succession of small English towns and villages, first as a Navy wife and then as the wife of a man who, &#x201c;let go&#x201d; by the Navy after a lifetime of service, worked for the rest of his days in bit-part jobs as an accountant or &#x201c;bursar.&#x201d; It is a terrible thing to feel sorry for one&#x2019;s mother or indeed father. And it&#x2019;s an additionally awful thing to feel this and to know the impotence of the adolescent to do anything at all about it. Worse still, perhaps, is the selfish consolation that it isn&#x2019;t really one&#x2019;s job to rear one&#x2019;s parents. Anyway, I knew that Yvonne felt that life was passing her by, and I knew that the money that could have given her the occasional glamorous holiday or trip to town was instead being spent (at her own insistence) on school fees for me and my brother, Peter (who had arrived during our time in Malta), so I resolved at least to work extremely hard and be worthy of the sacrifice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn&#x2019;t just sit there while I was away. She tried instead to become a force in the world of fashion. Perhaps answering the call of her milliner forebears, but at any rate determined not to succumb to the prevalent dowdiness of postwar Britain, she was forever involved in schemes for brightening the apparel of her friends and neighbors. &#x201c;One thing I <i>do </i>have,&#x201d; she used to say with a slightly defensive tone, as if she lacked some other qualities, &#x201c;is a bit of good taste.&#x201d; I personally thought she had the other qualities too: on those official holidays when parents would visit my boarding school and many boys almost expired in advance from the sheer dread of embarrassment, Yvonne never did, or wore, anything that I could later be teased about (and this was in the days when women still wore hats). She was invariably the prettiest and brightest of the mothers, and I could always kiss her gladly, right in front of everyone else, without any fear of mushiness, lipstick-stains, or other disasters. In those moments I would have dared anyone to tease me about her, and I was small for my age.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, the dress-shop business didn&#x2019;t go well. If it wasn&#x2019;t for bad luck, in fact, Yvonne would have had no luck at all. With various friends and partners she tried to float a store called Pandora&#x2019;s Box, I remember, and another called Susannah Munday, named for an ancestress of ours on the paternal Hampshire side. These enterprises just didn&#x2019;t fly, and I couldn&#x2019;t think why not except that the local housewives were just too drab and myopic and penny-pinching. I used to love the idea of dropping by as I went shopping, so that she could show me off to her friends and have a general shriek and gossip over some coffee, but I could always tell that business wasn&#x2019;t good. With what a jolt of recognition did I read, years later, V.S. Naipaul&#x2019;s uncanny diagnosis of the situation in <i>The Enigma of Arrival </i>. He was writing about Salisbury, which was close enough to Portsmouth:<br>&nbsp;<br>A shop might be just two or three minutes&#x2019; walk from the market square, but could be off the main shopping track. Many little businesses failed &#x2014; quickly, vi...</p><h2>The Longevity Plan: Seven Life-Transforming Lessons from Ancient China</h2><p><p>From a renowned Johns Hopkins- and Stanford-educated cardiologist at Intermountain Medical Center&#x2014;a hospital system that President Obama has praised as an "island of excellence"&#x2014;comes the story of his time living in Longevity Village in China, and the seven lessons he learned there that lead to a happy, healthy, long life.</p><p>At forty-four, acclaimed cardiologist John Day was overweight and suffered from insomnia, degenerative joint disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.

The same came for a witness, to bear witness of Whim, that all men through him might believe. He was not Chance, but was sent to bear witness of Chance. That was the true Accident, that randomizes every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of Chance, even to them that believe accidentally, they which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of Chance. And Chance was made flesh (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Great Fickle Father), and he dwelt among us, full of chaos and falsehood and whim.</p><p>&#x2014;from The Book of the Die</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>&#x201c;The style is the man,&#x201d; once said Richard Nixon and devoted his life to boring his readers.</p><p>What to do if there is no single man? Should the style vary as the man writing the autobiography varies, or as the past man he writes about varied? Literary critics would declare that the style of a chapter should correspond to the man whose life is being dramatized: a quite rational injunction, one that ought therefore to be repeatedly disobeyed. The comic life portrayed by Hamlet, everyday kitchen events being described by Churchill, the man in love described by an Einstein. Thus it will have to be. Let us have no more quibbles about style. If style and subject matter happen to congeal in any of these chapters it is a lucky accident, not, we may hope, soon to be repeated.</p><p>A cunning chaos: that is what my autobiography shall be. I shall make my order chronological, an innovation dared these days by few. But my style shall be random, with the wisdom of the Die. I shall sulk and soar, extol and sneer. I shall shift from first person to third person: I shall use first-person omniscient, a mode of narrative generally reserved for Another. When distortions and digressions occur to me in my life&#x2019;s history I shall embrace them, for a well-told lie is a gift of the gods. But the realities of the Dice Man&#x2019;s life are more entertaining than my most inspired fictions: reality will dominate&#x2014;for its entertainment value.</p><p>I tell my life&#x2019;s story for that humble reason which has inspired every user of the form: to prove to the world I am a great man. I shall fail, of course, like the others. &#x201c;To be great is to be misunderstood,&#x201d; Elvis Presley once said, and no one can refute him. I tell of a man&#x2019;s instinctive attempt to fulfill himself in a new way and I will be judged insane. So be it. Were it otherwise, I would fear I had failed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x2014;J. H. van den Berg</p><p>My aim is to bring about a psychic state in which my patient begins to experiment with his own nature&#x2014;a state of fluidity, change and growth, in which there is no longer anything eternally fixed and hopelessly petrified.</p><p>&#x2014;Carl Jung</p><p>The torch of chaos and doubt&#x2014;this is what the sage steers by.</p><p>&#x2014;Chuang-Tzu</p><p>I am Zarathustra the godless: I still cook every chance in my pot.</p><p>&#x2014;Nietzsche</p><p>Anybody can be anybody.</p><p>&#x2014;The Dice Man</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>I am a large man, with big butcher&#x2019;s hands, great oak thighs, rock-jawed head, and massive, thick-lens glasses. I&#x2019;m six foot four and weigh close to two hundred and thirty pounds; I look a little like Clark Kent, except that when I take off my business suit I am barely faster than my wife, only slightly more powerful than men half my size, and leap buildings not at all, no matter how many leaps I&#x2019;m given.</p><p>As an athlete I am exceptionally mediocre in all major sports and in several minor ones. I play daring and disastrous poker and cautious and competent stock market. I married a pretty former cheerleader and rock-and-roll singer and have two lovely, nonneurotic and abnormal children. I am deeply religious, have written the lovely first-rate pornographic novel, The Dance of Maya, and am not now nor have I ever been Jewish.</p><p>I realize that it&#x2019;s your job as a reader to try to create a credible consistent pattern out of all this, but I&#x2019;m afraid I must add that I am normally atheistic, have given away at random thousands of dollars, have been a sporadic revolutionary against the governments of the United States, New York City, the Bronx and Scarsdale, and am still a card-carrying member of the Republican Party. I am the creator, as most of you know, of those nefarious Dice Centers for experiments in human behavior which have been described by the Journal of Abnormal Psychology as &#x201c;outrageous,&#x201d; &#x201c;unethical,&#x201d; and &#x201c;informative&#x201d;; by The New York Times as &#x201c;incredibly misguided and corrupt&#x201d;; by Time magazine as &#x201c;sewers&#x201d;; and by the Evergreen Review as &#x201c;brilliant and fun.&#x201d; I have been a devoted husband, multiple adulterer and experimental homosexual; an able, highly praised analyst, and the only one ever dismissed from both the Psychiatrists Association of New York (PANY) and from the American Medical Association (for &#x201c;ill-considered activities&#x201d; and &#x201c;probable incompetence&#x201d;). I am admired and praised by thousands of dicepeople throughout the nation but have twice been a patient in a mental institution, once been in jail, and am currently a fugitive, which I hope to remain, Die willing, at least until I have completed this 305-page autobiography.</p><p>My primary profession has been psychiatry. My passion, both as psychiatrist and as Dice Man, has been to change human personality. Mine. Others&#x2019;. Everyone&#x2019;s. To give to men a sense of freedom, exhilaration, joy. To restore to life the same shock of experience we have when bare toes first feel the earth at dawn and we see the sun split through the mountain trees like horizontal lightning; when a girl first lifts her lips to be kissed; when an idea suddenly springs full-blown into the mind, reorganizing in an instant the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>Life is islands of ecstasy in an ocean of ennui, and after the age of thirty land is seldom seen. At best we wander from one much-worn sandbar to the next, soon familiar with each grain of sand we see.</p><p>When I raised the &#x201c;problem&#x201d; with my colleagues, I was assured that the withering away of joy was as natural to normal man as the decaying of his flesh and based on much the same physiological changes. The purpose of psychology, they reminded me, was to decrease misery, increase productivity, relate the individual to his society, and help him to see and accept his self. Not to alter necessarily the habits, values and interests of the self, but to see them without idealization and to accept them as they are.</p><p>It had always seemed to me a quite obvious and desirable goal for therapy but, after having been &#x201c;successfully&#x201d; analyzed, and after having lived in moderate happiness with moderate success with an average wife and family for seven years, I found suddenly, around my thirty-second birthday, that I wanted to kill myself. And to kill several other people too.</p><p>I took long walks over the Queensborough Bridge and brooded down at the water. I reread Camus on suicide as the logical choice in an absurd world. On subway platforms I always stood three inches from the edge, and swayed. On Monday mornings I would stare at the bottle of strychnine on my cabinet shelf. I would daydream for hours of nuclear holocausts searing the streets of Manhattan clean, of steamrollers accidentally flattening my wife, of taxis taking my rival Dr. Ecstein off into the East River, of a teenage babysitter of ours shrieking in agony as I plowed away at her virgin soil.</p><p>Now the desire to kill oneself and to assassinate, poison, obliterate or rape others is generally considered in the psychiatric profession as &#x201c;unhealthy.&#x201d; Bad. Evil. More accurately, sin. When you have the desire to kill yourself, you are supposed to see and &#x201c;accept it,&#x201d; but not, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, to kill yourself. If you desire to have carnal knowledge of helpless preteeners, you are supposed to accept your lust, and not lay a finger on even her big toe. If you hate your father, fine&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t slug the bastard with a bat. Understand yourself, accept yourself, but do not be yourself.</p><p>It is a conservative doctrine, guaranteed to help the patient avoid violent, passionate and unusual acts and to permit him a prolonged, respectable life of moderate misery. In fact, it is a doctrine aimed at making everyone live like psychotherapists. The thought nauseated me.</p><p>These trivial insights actually began to form in the weeks following my first unexplained plunge into depression, a depression ostensibly produced by a long writing block on my &#x201c;book,&#x201d; but actually part of a general constipation of the soul that had been a long time building up. I remember sitting at my big oak desk after breakfast each morning before my first appointment reviewing my past accomplishments and future hopes with a feeling of scorn. I would take off my glasses and, reacting to both my thoughts and the surrealistic haze which became my visual world without my glasses, I would intone dramatically, &#x201c;Blind! Blind! Blind!&#x201d; and bang my boxing-glove-sized fist down on the desk with a dramatic crash.</p><p>I had been a brilliant student throughout my educational career, piling up academic honors like my son Larry collects bubble-gum baseball cards. While still in medical school I published my first article on therapy, a well-received trifle called &#x201c;The Physiology of Neurotic Tension.&#x201d; As I sat at my desk, all articles I had ever published seemed absolutely as good as other men&#x2019;s articles: blah. My successes with patients seemed identical to those of my colleagues: insignificant. The most I had come to hope for was to free a patient from anxiety and conflict: to alter him from a life of tormented stagnation to one of complacent stagnation. If my patients had untapped creativity or inventiveness or drive, my methods of analysis had failed to dig them out. Psychoanalysis seemed an expensive, slow-working, unreliable tranquilizer. If LSD were really to do what Alpert and Leary claimed for it, all psychiatrists would be out of jobs overnight. The thought pleased me.</p><p>In the midst of my cynicism I would occasionally daydream of the future. My hopes? To excel in all that I had been doing in the past: to write widely acclaimed articles and books; to raise my children so they might avoid the mistakes I had made; to meet some technicolor woman with whom I would become soulmate for life. Unfortunately, the thought that these dreams might all be fulfilled plunged me into despair.</p><p>I was caught in a bind. No matter how I twisted or turned there seemed to be an anchor in my chest which held me fast, the long line leaning out against the slant of sea taut and trim, as if it were cleated fast into the rock of the earth&#x2019;s vast core. It held me locked, and when a storm of boredom and bitterness blew in I would plunge and leap against the line&#x2019;s rough-clutching knot to be away, to fly before the wind, but the knot grew tight, the anchor only dug the deeper in my chest; I stayed. The burden of my self seemed inevitable and eternal.</p><p>However, after a few months of wallowing in depression (I furtively had purchased a .38 revolver and nine cartridges), Karen Horney led me to discover D. T. Suzuki, Alan Watts and Zen, and the world of the rat race, which I had assumed to be normal and healthy for an ambitious young man, seemed suddenly like the world of a rat race.</p><p>I was stunned and converted&#x2014;as only the utterly bored can be. Seeing drive, greed and intellectual aspiration as meaningless and sick in my colleagues, I was able to make the unusual generalization to myself; I too had the same symptoms of grasping after illusions. The secret, I seemed to learn, was in not caring, in accepting the limitations, conflicts and ambiguities of life with joy and satisfaction, in effortless drifting with the flow of impulse. So life was meaningless? Who cares. So my ambitions are trivial? Pursue them anyway. Life seems boring? Yawn.</p><p>I followed impulse. I drifted. I didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>Unfortunately, life seemed to get more boring. Admittedly I was cheerfully, sometimes even gaily bored, where before I had been depressedly bored, but life remained essentially uninteresting. My mood of happy boredom was theoretically preferable to my desire to rape and kill, but personally speaking, not much. It was along about this stage of my somewhat sordid road to truth that I discovered the Dice Man.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>My life before D-Day was routine, humdrum, repetitious, trivial, compulsive, disordered, irritable&#x2014;the life of a typical successful married man. My new life began on a hot day in early July, 1968.</p><p>I awoke a little before seven, cuddled up to my wife Lillian, who was accordioned up into a Z in the bed beside me, and began pleasantly caressing her breasts, thighs and buttocks with my big gentle paws. I liked to begin the day this way: it set a standard by which to measure the gradual deterioration that succeeded from then on. After about four or five minutes we both rolled over and she began caressing me with her hands, and then with her lips, tongue and mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Nnn morning, sweetheart,&#x201d; one of us would eventually say. </p><p>&#x201c;Nnnn,&#x201d; would say the other.</p><p>From that point on the day&#x2019;s dialogue would all be downhill, but with warm, languid hands and lips floating over the body&#x2019;s most sensitive surfaces, the world was as near perfection as it ever gets. Freud called it a state of ego-less polymorphous perversity and frowned upon it, but I have little doubt that he never had Lil&#x2019;s hands gliding over him. Or his own wife&#x2019;s either for that matter. Freud was a very great man, but I never get the impression that anyone ever effectively stroked his penis.</p><p>Lil and I were slowly advancing to the stage where play is replaced by passion when two, three, four thumps resounded from the hall, our bedroom door opened, and sixty pounds of boy-energy exploded onto our bed in a graceless...</p></p><h2>The Economics of Inequality</h2><p><p>Thomas Piketty&#x2015;whose <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> pushed inequality to the forefront of public debate&#x2015;wrote <i>The Economics of Inequality</i> as an introduction to the conceptual and factual background necessary for interpreting changes in economic inequality over time. This concise text has established itself as an indispensable guide for students and general readers in France, where it has been regularly updated and revised. Translated by Arthur Goldhammer, <i>The Economics of Inequality</i> now appears in English for the first time.</p><p>Piketty begins by explaining how inequality evolves and how economists measure it. In subsequent chapters, he explores variances in income and ownership of capital and the variety of policies used to reduce these gaps. Along the way, with characteristic clarity and precision, he introduces key ideas about the relationship between labor and capital, the effects of different systems of taxation, the distinction between &#x201c;historical&#x201d; and &#x201c;political&#x201d; time, the impact of education and technological change, the nature of capital markets, the role of unions, and apparent tensions between the pursuit of efficiency and the pursuit of fairness.</p><p>Succinct, accessible, and authoritative, this is the ideal place to start for those who want to understand the fundamental issues at the heart of one of the most pressing concerns in contemporary economics and politics.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Piketty is Director of Studies at L&#x2019;�cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales and Professor at the Paris School of Economics. He is the author of <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>.</p>&#x201c;In a work that is aligned with but antecedent to his grand synthesis, <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>, French economist Piketty examines the structural causes of inequality... A discussion worth having and a book worth reading.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Piketty&#x2019;s <i>The Economics of Inequality</i> is an excellent book and a great companion to <i>Capital</i>.

This should be required reading for every concerned citizen.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Even a brief guide to basic concepts in Piketty&#x2019;s field of study can remind you, at every turn, that something profound is going on within the global economic system. The data, especially the data from recent decades, does not conceal the tale...Avarice and plunder play no part in the language of economics, but they too are causes and consequences of the phenomena Piketty describes. In some respects, his work is an assault on the kind of cult thinking that these days passes for economic and political analysis.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ian Bell</b><b>, </b><b><i>Glasgow Herald</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Piketty&#x2019;s <i>The Economics of Inequality</i>, which acts as a primer, provides a useful starting point for a wide audience.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tom Healy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Irish Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Translated into English for the first time, it offers an exceptionally clear, cogent, and coherent discussion of economic inequality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard N.

In the tradition of Howard Zinn's classic <i>A People's History of the United States</i>, Peter Irons chronicles the decisions that have influenced virtually every aspect of our society, from the debates over judicial power to controversial rulings in the past regarding slavery, racial segregation, and abortion, as well as more current cases about school prayer, the Bush/Gore election results, and "enemy combatants." To understand key issues facing the supreme court and the current battle for the court's ideological makeup, there is no better guide than Peter Irons.&nbsp;This revised and updated edition includes a foreword by Howard Zinn.<br><br>"A&nbsp;sophisticated narrative history of the Supreme Court . . . [Irons] breathes abundant life into old documents and reminds readers that today's fiercest arguments about rights are the continuation of the endless American conversation." -<i>Publisher's Weekly</i> (starred review)</p><p>The savvy, chatty author of <i>The Courage of Their Convictions</i> brings us a scholarly reckoning of the 200-plus years of decisions made by the highest court in the land. Not surprisingly (and justifiably, given his erudite arguments), Peter H. Irons represents the court's work as a never-ending appeal of the powerless to the powerful: of the just over 100 supreme justices who have sat on the court, all but two have been white, all but two have been men, and all but seven have been Christian, whereas the supplicants to our nation's highest bar are typically racial minorities, women, and deviants in some way from the religious and social mainstream.<p> Taking a representative (if not comprehensive) accounting of the Supreme Court's most significant decisions, Irons puts cultural and political context--and a human face--to the parties involved, painting an absorbing and involving picture of landmark cases that readers are likely to recall but not fully understand. Whether he's explicating the tortuous history of freedom-seeking slave Dred Scott or explaining the "a Jap's a Jap" reasoning behind the legal exculpation of World War II internment camps, Irons reminds us of the court's spotted history while still conveying the deep affection he has for it.

Mouse, 1)</h2><p><p>In this imaginative adventure from Newbery Medal-winning author Beverly Cleary, a young mouse named Ralph is thrown into a world of excitement when a boy and his shiny toy motorcycle check into the Mountain View Inn.</p><p>When the ever-curious Ralph spots Keith's red toy motorcycle, he vows to ride it. So when Keith leaves the bike unattended in his room one day, Ralph makes his move. But with all this freedom (and speed!) come a lot of obstacles. Whether dodging a rowdy terrier or keeping his nosy cousins away from his new wheels, Ralph has a lot going on! With a pal like Keith always looking out for him, there's nothing this little mouse can't handle.</p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p></p><p>"Pb-pb-b-b-b. Pb-pb-b-b-b." With these magic vocables, Ralph the mouse revs up a dream come true--his very own motorcycle. Living in a knothole in a hotel room, young Ralph has seen plenty of families come and go, some more generous with their crumbs than others. But when young Keith and his parents check in to the hotel, Ralph gets his first chance to check out. He has always fantasized about venturing beyond the second floor, maybe even outside. Curiosity overcomes caution, and Ralph must have a go at Keith's toy motorcycle. Soon, the headstrong mouse finds himself in a pickle, when all he wanted was to ride a motorcycle. Lucky for him, the boy understands how it is. When he discovers Ralph in his thwarted attempt to abscond with the toy bike, Keith generously encourages the rodent to ride. He even teaches him the simple trick of starting the motorcycle: "You have to make a noise... pb-pb-b-b-b." The subsequent situations Ralph motors into require quick thinking and grownup-sized courage. The team of Beverly Cleary and Louis Darling has been a great favorite for decades, introducing young chapter readers to Ramona, Beezus, Henry, and of course Ralph the mouse.

Daring combinations of bright colors were in. So were large hats, profusely trimmed. But by the end of the nineteenth century, ladies' tastes in fashion were changing, along with female lifestyles. Larger numbers of women were not only working outside the home, they were also playing tennis and golf, and riding bicycles and horses. All these activities called for a definite change in female fashions. Women came to rely on tailored suits with full skirts and fitted jackets over simple blouses. Riding habits called for a long, draped skirt worn over a pair of trousers.<br>With the dawn of the twentieth century, professional tailors turned to the comprehensive 1895 "Keystone" guide to create office outfits, riding pants, shirtwaists, and other garments. Filled with more than eighty patterns, the handy resource provided tailors with suggestions for fabric choices as well as instructions for the proper measurement, fitting, cutting, and sewing of such items as a bolero jacket, a shirtwaist with yoke, a single-breasted vest, and riding breeches.<br>Supplemented with a selection of newly captioned illustrations from <i>The Delineator</i> magazine, this volume will be a valuable reference for costume designers and fashion historians, and a fascinating window on the past for nostalgia enthusiasts.</p><p></p><h2>Tom Clancy Support and Defend (A Campus Novel)</h2><p><b>Over the course of three decades, Tom Clancy created a world alive with prescient action and remarkable individuals.

There wasn&#x2019;t much to it, really, just a narrow strip of sand that emerged from the darkness a few hundred meters off the ship&#x2019;s bow, but the first sight of land in four days told the man standing on the foredeck two important things.</p><p>One: The ingression phase of his operation had succeeded.</p><p>And two: The time had come to slit the captain&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>The man on the foredeck drew his knife and moved toward the stairs leading up to the navigation bridge. Two of his men fell into step behind him, but they were just along to watch. Responsibility for killing the captain fell to the leader and, in truth, he considered it no burden; in fact, he welcomed the opportunity to once again put his commitment to this mission on display for the others.</p><p>The leader and his team of six had spent three days on board an Omani fishing trawler on the open water of the Arabian Sea. Last night they came abreast of this eighty-foot dry-goods vessel and waved a shredded fan belt in the air. In Hindi they asked for help, but when the cargo ship drew even with them, the leader and his men scurried aboard like swamp rats and overran the small crew; they slaughtered all save the captain, and ordered him to head due east with a course set for India&#x2019;s Malabar Coast.</p><p>It had taken the leader half a day to convince the terrified captain he would not suffer the same fate as his crew. Killing him would make a lie of this, of course, but as the leader climbed the steps up to the dark bridge, he wasn&#x2019;t troubling himself about going back on his promise; his mind was already off this boat and onto the objective phase of the operation.</p><p>The leader was a lieutenant in the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, the militant wing of the Palestinian political organization Hamas. He&#x2019;d been sent on this mission to target a single man, but he had known all along that many others, the captain and his crew, for instance, would necessarily be sacrificed in the action.</p><p>So far he had been in total control of his operation. The next phase, by contrast, was in the hands of someone else, and this worried him greatly. Everything now hinged on the competence of a local contact. A woman, he had been told in his mission brief, who had verified the presence of the target and the disposition of the local police and had also, <i>Inshallah</i>, delivered a vehicle to his landing point and, <i>Inshallah</i>, remembered to leave the keys under the driver&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>The leader lost his balance momentarily at the top of the stairs on the outer bridge deck, and he reached out to steady himself. The men behind him were still climbing, they had not seen him stumble, and he was glad of this. They might wonder if it was a show of nerves on his part, and this he could not allow. Actually it was just a slight sway to starboard that unbalanced him, and it stood to reason his sea legs would falter. Born in the Gaza Strip, the leader had grown up within sight of the ocean but had never set foot on anything larger than a fishing skiff with an outboard motor before this week.</p><p>He had been chosen because of his intelligence, his ruthlessness, and his resolve, but certainly <i>not</i> for any maritime prowess.</p><p>Up here on the bridge deck, the leader stopped to scan the night in all directions. There were few signs of civilization onshore except for some wooden shacks, but an electric glow hung in the haze over the huge coastal metropolis of Kochi just forty-five kilometers to the south.</p><p>Satisfied no one was around to hear a scream across the open water, he reached for the door latch.</p><p>The middle-aged Indian captain did not turn as the leader entered the bridge. He kept his hands on the wheel, looking straight ahead, his chest heaving from dread.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>The leader continued forward with his knife shielded down behind his thigh; he&#x2019;d planned on asking a question as he approached, something nonchalant to distract the man, to put him at ease for the moment, but instead he kept silent, raising the blade in his right hand.</p><p>At three paces he rushed the man&#x2019;s back, reached around in front of his body with the knife, then thrust the blade into his neck and pulled it back across the bare throat. He withdrew the knife and took a single stride back. The Indian spun, blood spewed across the bridge, catching the leader&#x2019;s pants and sneakers though he leapt back the length of the small room to avoid it.</p><p>The other two watched through a portal by the door, clear of the arterial spray.</p><p>The captain dropped to his knees, air hissed and gurgled through the bloody wound for a moment. Then he died. Mercifully quick for everyone, the leader thought.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Allahu Akbar.&#x201d;</i> He said it with reverence, and he stepped over the body, tracking through the blood because there was no way to avoid it, and he put his hands on the wheel.</p><p>But for only a moment&#x2014;he was no captain. In fact, none of the men on board knew how to bring the cargo ship safely into port, the captain had even told them there <i>was</i> no port where they were going, so the leader just pulled the engines back to idle and ordered his men to move to the tender that had already been packed with gear and lowered into the black water on the port side.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>TWENTY MINUTES LATER the seven men climbed out of the small tender and into gentle shoreline surf, then pulled the boat onto the sand, beaching it just clear of the licking waves.</p><p>Leaving the boat here in the open would be no problem. They would not need it again; the leader&#x2019;s exfiltration route would be overland to the east, into Madurai and then out on an aircraft with forged papers. Plus, the boat would not stand out and jeopardize the mission, as several other small watercraft lay unattended around this spit of sand. Net fishermen had left them for the night, having first removed their outboard motors and taken them back to their thatched-roof homes to protect them from thieves.</p><p>The men pulled black canvas bags from the tender and donned their gear. Three strapped heavy vests under their large black windbreakers; the other four hung small rifles on slings around their necks along with pouches of extra ammunition. The guns were micro-Uzis, a nine-millimeter machine pistol of Israeli manufacture, but any irony in the choice of firearm was outweighed by the gun&#x2019;s undeniable reliability.</p><p>In three minutes they were off the sand, running up a dark beach road lined with palm and coconut trees.</p><p>The local contact had left her vehicle just off the road alongside a narrow ditch, exactly where she had been instructed to do so. True to the leader&#x2019;s brief, the vehicle was a large brown panel truck that delivered milk from a local farm to the residents of Kochi. The refrigerators had been removed from the back, and this created barely enough room for the five men who climbed through the side door.</p><p>The keys were there, under the seat, and the leader found himself both pleased with and surprised by the woman&#x2019;s competence. He slipped into the front passenger seat, his second-in-command took position behind the wheel, and the others sat in back without a word spoken among them.</p><p>They drove east, away from the beach and down a narrow paved road through the backwater, a system of both natural and man-made brackish lakes and canals where the Arabian Sea and the Periyar River meet. Coconut trees lined the road on both sides here, and thick haze diffused the headlights.</p><p>The leader checked his watch, then consulted with a handheld GPS device, loaded with coordinates given to him by the local agent. Their first stop was the cell phone tower on Paravur&#x2013;Bhoothakulam Road. There were no landlines at the objective, so disabling the tower would cut off their target&#x2019;s line of communication with the local police.</p><p>The leader conferred with his driver, then turned to face the men behind him. He saw only dark silhouettes.</p><p>He had known two of the five men for years; they, like the leader and the driver, were <i>fedayeen</i> from the territories. He could make them out by their posture even though he could not see their faces. The other three men he&#x2019;d met at the camp in Yemen only shortly before setting sail. He focused on these foreigners exclusively, and even smiled at them like a patient and benevolent uncle.</p><p>The smile was a ruse; he thought the men fools; he refused to arm them with guns because he didn&#x2019;t trust them as competent soldiers. These men would not wield weapons, the leader had decided, because they <i>were</i> weapons.</p><p>His smile deepened, and then he spoke to the fools in Arabic. &#x201c;The time draws near, my brave brothers. You must prepare yourselves for martyrdom.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>DOMINIC CARUSO was only thirty-two years old, and by any fair measure physically fit, but still he found it difficult keeping stride with the fifty-year-old man running several paces ahead of him. In the past hour the pair had done five miles of roadwork broken up by a half-mile swim, and the conditions here weren&#x2019;t helping. Dom sucked as much of the fetid air as he could get into his lungs just to keep going. It was the middle of the night and still hot as hell, and the jungle path was dark save for a little hazy moonlight that filtered through the palms above.</p><p>Dom&#x2019;s running partner seemed to be having no trouble finding his way in the darkness, but Dom caught the toe of his shoe on the exposed root of a jacaranda tree, and he fell headlong to his hands and knees.</p><p>&#x201c;Son of a bitch.&#x201d; He said it under labored breath.</p><p>His trainer looked back at him but kept running. Dom thought he detected a smile on the older man&#x2019;s face. His voice was low and heavily accented. &#x201c;Do you need an ambulance?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then get the fuck up.&#x201d; The older man chuckled, then added, &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, D, soldier on.&#x201d; He turned away and picked up the pace.</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Dom climbed back to his feet, wiped warm mud on his shorts, and took off in pursuit.</p><p>A month ago there was no way in hell the American could have run a ten-K in eighty-five-degree heat and ninety-five percent humidity, especially not in the middle of the night after a full day of training in martial arts. But since his arrival here in India he&#x2019;d made advances in his physical and mental strength faster than he could have imagined, and he owed this all to Arik Yacoby, the man now forty feet ahead of him.</p><p>The muddy jungle path ended at a paved road, and Arik turned to the left and began sprinting along it. Dominic gave chase even though he thought they should have been going to the right; he was the visitor, after all, and he trusted that Yacoby knew his way around these roads better than he.</p><p>Yacoby wasn&#x2019;t a local, but he&#x2019;d lived here a few years, and by his elite physical condition it was obvious he&#x2019;d run these trails and roads hundreds of times.</p><p>Dom knew very little about Arik Yacoby&#x2019;s past: only that he was Israeli, an �migr� to India, and he had once been a member of the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces. Dom had no trouble picturing Arik as an elite soldier; his fitness and discipline and the confident and determined glint in his steely eyes announced this fact to anyone who knew what to look for.</p><p>Dom had come here to India to train with the man for six weeks. Yacoby held a fourth-degree black belt in Krav Maga, a martial art developed for the Israeli military. Dom&#x2019;s hand-to-hand training with Arik had been intense in and of itself, but these additional nighttime PT sessions had added another facet to the grueling experience.</p><p>They&#x2019;d swum, they&#x2019;d run, they&#x2019;d climbed&#x2014;often all in the same night. It seemed to Dom as if Arik felt it his duty to impart not just the skills of hand-to-hand combat, but every physical and mental aspect of serving in the Israeli Special Forces.</p><p>Everything short of the use of firearms, that is. This was India, and although Arik Yacoby was now a permanent resident of Paravur, he was no cop, and no soldier, and he therefore could not obtain a gun legally.</p><p>But Dom didn&#x2019;t think Yacoby&#x2019;s lack of a firearm made him in any way less dangerous.</p><p>This India quest to study Krav Maga was the third evolution of five in a four-month training course for Dominic Caruso. Just before coming here, Dom had spent three weeks mountain climbing in the Yukon, led in one-on-one tutelage by a veteran Canadian alpinist. And before that, he&#x2019;d spent two weeks in Reno, Nevada, studying sleight of hand and other applications of misdirection from a master magician.</p><p>After his Krav Maga training in India, Dom was slated to fly to Pennsylvania to work with a former U.S. Marine sniper on his long-distance shooting, and then from there he would go straight to Sapporo, Japan, to learn from a master in edged-weapon combat.</p><p>At each of these evolutions Dom tapped the experience of his expert trainers in the one-on-one courses and peppered them with literally thousands of questions. The trainers, on the other hand, didn&#x2019;t ask him much of anything. They didn&#x2019;t know his real name&#x2014;Arik just referred to him as D&#x2014;they didn&#x2019;t know his organization, they didn&#x2019;t know his background. All they knew, all they <i>needed</i> to know, was that Dom came with the blessing of important people connected to the U.S. intelligence community.</p><p>There was certainly an assumption by the trainers that Dom was CIA or DIA or JSOC or some other acronym that meant trouble, and Caruso himself did nothing to dispel that notion. But he was none of these things, nor was he an employee of any official government agency. Instead, Dominic Caruso was an operations officer for an entity known as The Campus. It was an off-the-books intelligence organization with a direct-action arm. Only a few in official government ranks knew of its existence, and these few made the connections to the one-on-one elite training cadre around the world, so Dom and his fellow C...</p></p><h2>McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality</h2><p><p>A lively and razor-sharp critique of mindfulness as it has been enthusiastically co-opted by corporations, public schools, and the US military.</p> <p>Mindfulness is now all the rage. From celebrity endorsements to monks, neuroscientists and meditation coaches rubbing shoulders with CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it is clear that mindfulness has gone mainstream. Some have even called it a revolution.</p> <p>But what if, instead of changing the world, mindfulness has become a banal form of capitalist spirituality that mindlessly avoids social and political transformation, reinforcing the neoliberal status quo?</p> <p>InMcMindfulness, Ronald Purser debunks the so-called "mindfulness revolution," exposinghow corporations, schools, governments and the military have coopted it as technique for social control and self-pacification. A lively and razor-sharp critique, Purser busts the myths its salesmen rely on, challenging the narrative that stress is self-imposed and mindfulness is the cure-all.</p> <p>If we are to harness the truly revolutionary potential of mindfulness, wehave to cast off its neoliberal shackles, liberating mindfulness for a collective awakening.</p></p><p>Ronald Purser is a Professor of Management at San Francisco State University. His essays and cultural criticism have appeared in the Huffington Post, Salon, Alternet and Tricycle magazine. His viral article, &#34;Beyond McMindfulness&#34;, opened the floodgates for the mindfulness backlash. His recent books include the Handbook of Mindfulness: Culture, Context and Social Engagement and the Handbook of Ethical Foundations of Mindfulness. Dr. Purser began his Buddhist training beginning in 1981 at the Tibetan Nyingma Institute in Berkeley, California and is an ordained Buddhist teacher in the Korean Zen Taego order.

Alan Wallace</strong>, President, Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies<br><br>&#x201c;Far from being either a harmless form of New Age self-indulgence or meditation dressed up as a medicalized antidote to the ubiquitous stresses of modern life, Ron Purser sees the mindfulness movement as epitomizing a malignant trend of contemporary Western individualism, one that is blinding us to the social problems of inherent in neoliberalism and capitalism, providing an anodyne where what is needed is rigorous analysis and political action.&#x201d; <br>- <strong>Barry Magid</strong>, author of <em>What&#x2019;s Wrong With Mindfulness<br></em><br>&#x201c;<em>McMindfulness</em> makes an important critique of self-centered mindfulness and points us towards a new vision for real social change.&#x201d; <br>- <strong>Christopher Titmuss</strong>, author of <em>The Political Buddha</em> <br><br>&#x201c;Ron Purser cuts through the comforting New Age jargon used to promote mindfulness, enabling us to distinguish between the practice and its marketing.&#x201d; <br>- <strong>Richard Payne</strong>, Institute of Buddhist Studies<br><br>"Timely and incisive...

As their story recaptures the imagination of Floridians and their paintings fetch ever-escalating prices, the legacy of their freshly conceived landscapes exerts a new and powerful influence on the popular conception of the Sunshine State.</p><p>While the value of Highwaymen paintings has soared in recent years, until now no authoritative account of the lives and work of these black Florida artists has existed. Emerging in the late 1950s, the Highwaymen created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida dream and peddled, by some estimates, 200,000 of them from the trunks of their cars.<br><br> &nbsp; Working with inexpensive materials, the Highwaymen produced an astonishing number of landscapes that depict a romanticized Florida--a faraway place of wind-swept palm trees, billowing cumulus clouds, wetlands, lakes, rivers, ocean, and setting sun. With paintings still wet, they loaded their cars and traveled the state's east coast, selling the images door-to-door and store-to-store, in restaurants, offices, courthouses, and bank lobbies.<br><br> &nbsp;Sometimes characterized as motel art, the work is a hybrid form of landscape painting, corrupting the classically influenced ideals of the Highwaymen&#x2019;s white mentor, A. E. "Bean" Backus. At first, the paintings sold like boom-time real estate. In succeeding decades, however, they were consigned to attics and garage sales. Rediscovered in the mid-1990s, today they are recognized as the work of American folk artists.<br><br> &nbsp;Gary Monroe tells the story behind the Highwaymen, a loose association of 25 men and 1 woman from the Ft. Pierce area--a fascinating mixture of individual talent, collective enterprise, and cultural heritage. He also offers a critical look at the paintings and the movement's development. Added to this are personal reminiscences by some of the artists, along with a gallery of 63 full-color reproductions of their paintings.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Gary Monroe,</b> professor of visual art at Daytona State College, is a documentary photographer with a long-time interest in "outsider" and vernacular art.

From William Shakespeare and Walt Whitman to R. S. Gwynn and Jennifer Michael Hecht, the voices gathered in this collection will be more than welcome to those who've been struck by bad news, who are burdened by stress, or who simply appreciate the power of good poetry.</p><p>Garrison Keillor, author of nearly a dozen books, is founder and host of the acclaimed radio show <b>A Prairie Home Companion</b> and the daily program <b>The Writer's Almanac</b>. He is also a regular contributor to <b>Time</b> magazine.Having revived the radio variety program with <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> Garrison Keillor turned to broadcasting poetry in the daily short feature <i>The Writer's Almanac</i>. In any given week, probably more people hear him read poems than attend poetry readings and slams. That's good because his taste is excellent. But then, his criteria are golden. For him, a poem is good if it's memorable, recitable, and accessible. The almost-unheard-of-for-poetry sales of <i>Good Poems</i> (2002) suggest that many endorse his taste and criteria, and the sequel to that success gives them no reason to change their minds. As before, the range of poets represented is broad contemporarily (the majority are alive or very recently deceased) and historically (sixteenth to twenty-first century), though not internationally, for, with one exception (Psalm 51), English is these poems' language of origin. As before, too, these are predominantly poems of domesticity and ordinary things, and when a poem touches the genuinely extraordinary, it is related to everyday life; for instance, Stephen Dobyns' "Thelonious Monk" relates a particular instance of a kind of experience virtually everyone has--the discovery of greatness. Even those tired of Lake Wobegon, or who think Keillor's a bigoted Democrat (especially after <i>Homemade Democrat</i>, 2004), should grant that he knows good poetry. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

One is from Charlotte saying she finished early and decided to meet up with our boss, so she&#x2019;ll see me at Toby&#x2019;s house later. One is from Toby, saying, 7 p.m.: Don&#x2019;t forget! And three are from Morgan.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t read those yet.</p><p>I head off campus and a few blocks over to where I parked my car in an attempt to avoid the daily after-school gridlock. But of course the driver&#x2019;s side lock won&#x2019;t unlock when I turn the key, so I have to go around the passenger side and open the door and climb across the seat to pull up the other lock and shut the passenger door and go around to the driver&#x2019;s side again&#x2014;and by the time I&#x2019;m through with that twenty-second process, the cars are already backed up at the light. So I inch into the road and pull out my phone and read what Morgan wrote.</p><p>You okay?</p><p>R u coming to set later? </p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t write back. I am going straight to set, but not to see her. I need to measure the space between a piano and a bookshelf to see if the music stand I found on Abbot Kinney Boulevard yesterday will make things look too crowded. The music stand is beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that if it doesn&#x2019;t fit I will find a new bookshelf, or rearrange the furniture entirely, because this is exactly what I would have in my practice room if I knew how to play an instrument. And if I could afford a nine-hundred-dollar music stand.</p><p>As the light turns and I roll my car through the intersection, I&#x2019;m trying to ignore Morgan&#x2019;s texts and think only of the music stand. This music stand is a miracle. It&#x2019;s exactly what I didn&#x2019;t even know I was looking for. The part that holds the sheet music is this perfect oxidized green. When I texted my boss a picture of the stand she wrote back, Fucking amazing!!!! An expletive and four exclamation marks. And when I texted Morgan to tell her that this was the last time I would allow myself to get dumped by her, that breaking up and getting back together six times was already insane, and there was absolutely no way I would take her back a seventh, she replied with, I don&#x2019;t know what to do! Indecisive and only mildly emphatic. So typical.</p><p>But the music stand, the music stand.</p><p>Turning right onto La Cienega, my phone rings and it&#x2019;s Charlotte.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to come here,&#x201d; she says. </p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ginger took me to an estate sale.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A good one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You just have to come.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Someone famous?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds fun but I need to measure for that music stand.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Emi,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Trust me. You need to come here now.&#x201d; </p><p>So I scribble down the address, make a U-turn, and head toward the Hollywood Hills. I drive up Sunset and roll down all the windows, partly because the air-conditioning doesn&#x2019;t work and it&#x2019;s ninety degrees, but mostly because I&#x2019;m driving past palm trees and hundreds of beauty parlors and taco trucks and doughnut shops and clothing stores and nightclubs, and I like to take it all in and think about how Los Angeles is the best place in the world.</p><p>I turn when my phone tells me to turn and start ascending the hills, where the roads become narrower and the houses more expensive. I keep going, higher than I&#x2019;ve ever gone, until the houses are not only way bigger and nicer than the already big, nice houses below them, but also farther apart. And, finally, I turn into a driveway that I&#x2019;m pretty sure has never before encountered a beat-up hatchback with locks that don&#x2019;t work.</p><p>I park under the branches of old, gorgeous trees that are full and green in spite of the arrival of summer, step out of my car, lean against the bumper, and take a look at this house. My job has taken me to a lot of ridiculously nice houses, but this one stands out. It&#x2019;s older and grander, but there&#x2019;s more to it than that. It just feels different. More significant. I&#x2019;m not thinking about Morgan and thinking instead about who might have owned this house. It was probably someone old, which is good, because an estate sale means someone has died, and it&#x2019;s sad to dig through thirty-year-old people&#x2019;s stuff and think about the futures they could have had.</p><p>The double front doors swing open and Charlotte steps into the sun. Her jeans are rolled up at the ankles and her blond hair is in pigtails, and her face is part serious, part elated.</p><p>&#x201c;Guess,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I try to think of who has died in the last couple of weeks. My first thought is our physics teacher&#x2019;s grandmother, but I seriously doubt she would have lived in a house like this one. Then I think of someone else, but I don&#x2019;t say anything because the thought is crazy. This death is huge. Front-page huge. Every-time-I-turn-on-the-radio huge.</p><p>But then&#x2014;there&#x2019;s this house, which is clearly an important house, and old, beautiful trees, and Charlotte&#x2019;s mouth, which is twitching under the tremendous effort of not smiling.</p><p>Plus it isn&#x2019;t swarming with people, which means this is some kind of preview that Ginger got invited to because she&#x2019;s a famous production designer and she always gets called to these things first.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>And Charlotte starts nodding. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious.&#x201d;</p><p>Her hands fly to her face because she&#x2019;s giddy with the delirious laughter of someone who has spent the last hour in the house of a man who was arguably the most emblematic actor in American cinema.</p><p>Clyde Jones. Icon of the American Western.</p><p>She leans against the house, doubles over, slides onto the marble landing. I let her have one of her rare hysterical fits of laughter as I take it all in. I can&#x2019;t think of enough expletives to perfectly capture this moment. I would need a year&#x2019;s worth of exclamation points. So I just stare, openmouthed, thinking of the man who used to live here.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s hysterics die down, and soon she is standing, composed again, back to her super-brilliant, future museum-studies-major self.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I pause in the colossal doorway. Outside is bright and hot, a beautiful Los Angeles day. Inside it&#x2019;s darker. I can feel the air-conditioning escaping. Even though this is an amazing opportunity that will never come again, I don&#x2019;t know if I should go any farther. The thing is this: My brother, Toby, and I talk all the time about what movies do. They speak to our desires, which are never small. They allow us to escape and to dream and to gaze into eyes that are impossibly beautiful and huge. When you live in LA and work in the movies, you experience the collapse of some of that fantasy. You know that the eyes glow like that because of lights placed at a specific angle, and you see the actresses up close and, yes, they are beautiful, but they are human size and imperfect like the rest of us.</p><p>This, though, is different.</p><p>Because even if you know a little bit too much about how movies are made, there are always things you don&#x2019;t know. You can hold on to the myth surrounding the actors; you can get swept up in the story.</p><p>Clyde Jones belongs in the Old West. He belongs under the stars, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and listening to the wind. In A Long Time Till Tomorrow he lived in a log cabin. In Lowlands he lived out of a green pickup truck, sleeping by the side of the road a couple hours at a time, searching for a woman from his past.</p><p>Clyde Jones is the savior. The good, uncomplicated man. The perfect cowboy. But as soon as I walk through this doorway he will be an actor who spent his life in a Los Angeles mansion. The ultimate collapse of the fantasy.</p><p>&#x201c;Em?&#x201d; Charlotte says. She steps to the left, gesturing that I should follow, and I can&#x2019;t help myself. A moment later I&#x2019;m in Clyde Jones&#x2019;s foyer, the doors shut behind me, gazing at one of the most beautiful objects I&#x2019;ve ever beheld: a low-hanging chandelier, geometric and silver and shining.</p><p>Clyde Jones was no cowboy, but his aesthetic sensibilities were amazing.</p><p>I&#x2019;m still dying over Clyde&#x2019;s house when Ginger strides past me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good, Emi, you made it.&#x201d; Charlotte and I follow her into the living room.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I say, standing under the high white-beamed ceiling, next to what I can only assume is a pair of original Swan chairs positioned under a huge pastoral landscape with a clear sky as endless as the skies in his films. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably better that I don&#x2019;t go to the studio today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These glasses,&#x201d; Ginger says, pointing, and Charlotte walks over to a shiny minibar and takes a tray of highball glasses. &#x201c;Why should you avoid the studio? Oh, let me guess: Morgan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She broke up with me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something about not being tied down. Life&#x2019;s vast possibilities.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018; Life&#x2019;s vast possibilities.&#x2019; Such bullshit,&#x201d; Charlotte says, setting the glasses next to a group of other beautiful objects that Ginger must have already chosen.</p><p>I say, &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; but only because that&#x2019;s what Charlotte needs me to say. Charlotte is the kind of friend who automatically hates everyone who has ever done me wrong. The first time Morgan broke up with me and we got back together, Charlotte tried her best to get over it and be nice to Morgan. But somewhere around the third time, Charlotte got rude. Stopped saying hi. Stopped smiling around her. By now, Charlotte can&#x2019;t even hear Morgan&#x2019;s name without clenching her jaw.</p><p>Ginger shoots me a sympathetic look.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done with movie people.&#x201d;</p><p>And then we all laugh, because really. What a ridiculous thing to say.</p><p>~</p><p>When Ginger is finished choosing what she wants, she lets Charlotte and me explore for a while and see if there&#x2019;s anything we want to buy. We find ourselves in Clyde&#x2019;s study, which has to be the size of my brother&#x2019;s entire apartment. It has high ceilings supported by thick wooden beams and an entire wall of windows with doors that slide open to the land in back. Of all the rooms, this one feels the most Western. There&#x2019;s an enormous rustic table that he must have used as a desk and a collection of leather chairs arranged in a semicircle facing a cavernous fireplace. Shelves line the entirety of one of the side walls, and covering the shelves are hundreds of awards including four Oscars, along with objects from his films: cowboy hats and guns and silver belt buckles.</p><p>Most people our age don&#x2019;t know or care very much about Clyde. His career is long over. His roles were rarely sophisticated or smart; there isn&#x2019;t much to recommend him to my generation. But my brother has eclectic tastes, and when he loves something, it becomes nearly impossible not to love it along with him. So over the years I became infatuated with the moment that Clyde appears on the horizon or in the saloon or riding through tall grass toward the woman he loves.</p><p>Standing in his study now feels both unexpected and inevitable. And, more than those things, it feels meaningful. Like all of Clyde&#x2019;s arrivals. Like, without knowing it, everything I&#x2019;ve done has been building toward this moment.</p><p>&#x201d;Are you all right?&#x201d; Charlotte asks me.</p><p>I just nod, because how could I describe this feeling in a way that would make sense? There is no logic behind it.</p><p>I pick up one of the belt buckles. It&#x2019;s heavier than I thought it would be, and more beautiful up close: the smooth silhouette of a bucking horse with a rough mountain and waning moon in the background.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to see how much they&#x2019;re asking for this,&#x201d; I say. </p><p>Charlotte cocks her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re choosing a belt buckle?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Toby,&#x201d; I say, and Charlotte blushes because she&#x2019;s been in love with my brother forever. Reminded, I check my phone and see that we&#x2019;re supposed to meet up with him in just under two hours.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s flipping through records. She pulls out a Patsy Cline album.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get over this,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Clyde Jones used to sit on these chairs and listen to this record.&#x201d;</p><p>We find Ginger signing a credit card slip for over twenty thousand dollars, which might explain why, when we show the estate sale man the belt buckle and Patsy Cline record, he beams at us and says, &#x201c;My gift to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Charlotte, will you get Harrison on the phone?&#x201d; Charlotte does, and hands the phone to the man to arrange a pickup, and then we are back in Clyde&#x2019;s hot drive- way, out of his house forever.</p><p>~</p><p>Toby lives in a classic LA courtyard apartment, like the one in David Lynch&#x2019;s film Mulholland Drive, which chooses to focus on the darker side of the movie business, and also the one in Melrose Place, which was a nineties TV show set in West Hollywood that my dad lectures about in his Pop Culture of Los Angeles course at UCLA. Toby&#x2019;s courtyard has a tidy green lawn and a pretty fountain, and from the side of his cottage you can see a tiny strip of the ocean. We walk in, and there is his stuff, packed, waiting by the door. A set of matching suitcases that look so grown up.</p><p>He hugs us both. Me first and long, Charlotte next and quicker. Then he stands and faces us, my tan brother with his crooked smile and black hair that&#x2019;s always in his eyes. I feel sad, and then I push the sadness away because of what we have to tell him.</p><p>&#x201c;Toby,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;We spent the afternoon in Clyde Jones&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re shitting me,&#x201d; he says, his eyes wide. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Charlotte says. &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His house was full of the most amazing&#x2014;&#x201d; I start, but Toby puts his hands over his ears. </p><p>&#x201c;Dont&#x2019;tellmedon&#x2019;ttellmedon&#x2019;ttellme,&#x201d; he says. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;The collapse of the fantasy,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>I know, I mouth, all exaggerated so he can read my lips. </p><p>&#x201c;I love Clyde Jones,&#x201d; he says, dropping his hands.</p><p>I nod. &#x201c;Not another word on the subject,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But I do have something for you. Close your eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>My brother does as told and holds out his hands. I pretend I don&#x2019;t notice Charlotte staring at him, and place the belt buckle in his cupped palms. He opens his eyes. Doesn&#x2019;t say anything. I wonder whether I chose the wrong object, and then I realize that tears are starting.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, please,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy. Shit.&#x201d; He blinks rapidly to compose himself. Then he rushes to his bookshelf of DVDs and pulls one out. He&#x2019;s mumbling to himself as he turns on his TV and waits for the chapter selection to appear on the screen. &#x201c;Saloon door . . . I&#x2019;m a man of the law but that don&#x2019;t make me honest . . . Round these parts . . . Yes!&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;s found the scene, and we all squeeze onto my parents&#x2019; old sofa, me in the middle acting as a buffer for the sexual tension between my brother and my best friend.</p><p>Toby presses play and turns up the volume. I recognize it as The Strangers, but I&#x2019;ve only seen it a couple times so I&#x2019;ve forgotten a lot of what&#x2019;s happening. The scene begins with a shot of a saloon door. We hear the voices of the people inside but the camera doesn&#x2019;t turn to them. When one person matters so much, all you can do is wait for his arrival. And then boots appear at the bottom of the door, a hat above it. The doors burst open and there stands Clyde Jones.</p><p>The screen fills with a close-up of his young, knowing face, shaded by a cowboy hat. He scans the saloon until he sees the sheriff, drinking at a table with one of the bad guys. The camera shifts to his cowb...</p></p><h2>Radical Reproductive Justice: Foundation, Theory, Practice, Critique</h2><p><p>This anthology assembles two decades of work initiated by SisterSong Women of Color Health Collective, creators of the human rights&#x2013;based &#x201c;reproductive justice&#x201d; framework to move beyond polarized pro-choice/pro-life debates.

This is the very young person in Hans Christian Andersen&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes,&#x201d; who entered posterity by speaking out, free and heedless of consensus, careerism, peer pressure, personal safety, legal repercussions, and, freest and most heedless of all, &#x201c;giving offense.&#x201d; <br>If you recall, the procession of the naked emperor, arrayed in what was put over, flimflam style, as rich and sumptuous attire, was a great success so long as the crowd played along and participated in the charade. &#x201c;Nobody would let on that he couldn&#x2019;t see anything,&#x201d; Andersen writes, &#x201c;because then he would have been unfit for his job or very stupid.&#x201d; It was at this point that the little child&#x2014;boy or girl, we never know which&#x2014;said its famous line: <br>&#x201c;But he hasn&#x2019;t got anything on!&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2026; And it was whispered from man to man what the child had said&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Why, but he hasn&#x2019;t got anything on!&#x201d; they all shouted at last. <br>And the emperor winced, for he felt they were right. But he thought to himself: &#x201c;I must go through with the procession now.&#x201d; And he drew himself up more proudly than ever, while the chamberlains walked behind him, bearing the train that wasn&#x2019;t there.2 <br>So ends one of the great cliff-hangers. Will the emperor and his chamberlains brazen it out, cowing the people into acquiescence and thus maintaining their power? Or will the people have the courage to trust their own eyes and, relying on the evidence before them, call the emperor and his men to account? In considering these possibilities, never underestimate the influence of those invisible-train-bearing chamberlains, each one of whom has everything to lose if the empire of lies goes down. <br>There is hope, at least, in the open question. There is inspiration, too, in the example of the child who tells the truth. However, the forces of illusion and self-delusion are formidable foes against such outbursts of reality. The odds are against any public reckoning. More likely than not, the free-speaking child will be hushed up or badly shunned until it, too, either learns &#x201c;better&#x201d; or loses heart in the reeducation process. After all, it&#x2019;s not easy to continue shouting out what is in plain sight when surrounding society is determined to ignore, overlook, or even hide it. When &#x201c;everyone&#x201d; agrees there is nothing there, what is there becomes invisible by consensus, and the Big Lie lives. At some point, even this child may buy into it. <br>Not a chance. <br>This child, too, is a force in history, as the following chronicle of Big Lies will tell us, its voice calling out the nation&#x2019;s betrayal in a desperate struggle to pass on dangerous knowledge that is too often suppressed. We must listen for these voices. You will hear them time and again in the following pages. Sometimes the child has bad teeth and mumbles. Sometimes he pierces the echo chamber of lies with a funny accent. Sometimes he sports a yachting cap and hails from the Social Register. Sometimes she&#x2014;for, yes, there were such women, too&#x2014;is careworn, eyes seared by unimaginable hell on earth. Sometimes she is quirky. But the child is always true, always real. It is the rest, the emperors and chamberlains all around, who are as false and hollow as the historical narrative they create, assuming we will follow along. As, in fact, we do. That is our problem today. Heirs to a false and hollow history, we become unwitting participants, perpetuating and entrenching many, many lies as we take our places in a secretly subverted pageant&#x2014;and never know it. <br>That&#x2019;s partly because this subversion of our history, this assault on our nation&#x2019;s character, has no visible markers or specific constituencies. From the inner rings of the Pentagon to the principal&#x2019;s office in a local grammar school, we see nothing amiss. Our people still look, speak, and comport themselves just as they should, snapping salutes and schooling the young. What&#x2019;s changed here is on the inside. Forced to reckonings that require gathering facts and drawing conclusions about ourselves or others, we do not fall back on a vital store of survival instinct and moral code; we fall back on a perversion of both. It is in this moment of free fall when we must look more closely to understand what has happened to us. <br>Let me illustrate with a true story about a real-life U.S. Navy admiral that first crystallized the syndrome for me several years ago. You know the type: steel-gray hair, clipped; military ribbons, bristling; dutiful, loyal, the works. One day in this long-drawn-out post-9/11 era, this admiral received a lengthy, extensively documented briefing on the Islamic doctrine of jihad (Islamic war) from Maj. Stephen C. Coughlin, U.S. Army Reserves. Coughlin is an expert on the legal-religious doctrine that Islamic terrorists claim as the justification for campaigns of violence against infidels and rival Muslims.3 His briefings, which I&#x2019;ve attended multiple times, are legendary in security circles in Washington and elsewhere for their comprehensive, if not overwhelming, compilation of factual, Islamic-sourced evidence, which demonstrates, for example, that Islamic terrorists are not &#x201c;hijacking&#x201d; Islamic law (sharia) when they engage in jihad. On the contrary, they are executing it. Nor are they &#x201c;twisting&#x201d; the foundational principles of Islam as codified in each and every authoritative Islamic source. They are exemplifying them. <br>For reasons that should become clearer over the following pages, this briefing on these basic facts of jihad doctrine is typically our top military leaders&#x2019; <i>first exposure</i> to what is known in Pentagon parlance as the &#x201c;enemy threat doctrine.&#x201d; I am not exaggerating. Years of battle&#x2014;even worse, years of battle <i>planning</i>&#x2014;have passed without our leadership having studied, or even having become acquainted with, the principles and historic facts of Islamic war doctrine. Four years into the so-called war on terror, then&#x2013;Joint Chiefs Chairman Peter Pace even pointed this out in a speech at the National Defense University on December 1, 2005.4 <br>Notwithstanding Pace&#x2019;s concern, the study and analysis of Islam and jihad remained de facto forbidden in policy-making circles inside the Bush White House, which even codified a lexicon in 2008 to help government officials discuss Islamic jihad without mentioning &#x201c;Islam&#x201d; or &#x201c;jihad.&#x201d;5 The Obama administration would carry this same see-no-Islam policy to its zealous limit, finally mounting a two-front assault on the few trainers and fact-based training materials that were sometimes (sparingly) used by law enforcement agencies and the military to educate personnel about Islam and jihad. What history should remember as the Great Jihad Purges of 2012 began at the Justice Department, affecting domestic law enforcement agencies, and spread to the Pentagon, affecting the entire U.S. military. <br>First, the FBI eliminated hundreds of pages of &#x201c;anti-Islam&#x201d; educational material from its own training programs and those of other law enforcement agencies. Several Muslim advocacy groups applauded these purge results at the briefing at the bureau on February 15, 2012, &#x201c;unexpectedly&#x201d; attended by FBI Director Robert Mueller himself.6 Next, on April 24, 2012, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin E. Dempsey ordered a similar scrub, calling on the entire U.S. military to &#x201c;review&#x201d; its educational and training classes, files, and rosters of instructors to ensure that no members of the armed services were studying material &#x201c;disrespectful of the Islamic religion.&#x201d;7 <br>What exactly does the U.S. government and its Muslim advisers consider &#x201c;anti-Islam&#x201d; or &#x201c;disrespectful,&#x201d; or, as a Pentagon spokesman put it on Al Jazeera TV, &#x201c;warped views&#x201d;?8 One trophy of this so-called Islamophobia that made it into <i>Wired.com</i> (whose reportage seems to have energized if not triggered these government purges) was a PowerPoint slide created by Stephen C. Coughlin about the &#x201c;permanent command in Islam for Muslims to hate and despise Jews and Christians and not take them as friends.&#x201d;9 <br>Pretty disrespectful and warped for sure&#x2014; <i>but only if Coughlin&#x2019;s premise and supporting documentation were untrue</i>. The statement and the documentation, however, are incontrovertible. There <i>is</i> a permanent command in Islam for Muslims to hate and despise Jews and Christians and not take them as friends. The slide in question includes citations of the most authoritative Islamic texts, the Koran and the hadiths (the sayings and deeds of Mohammed, which Muslims hold sacred) to document its veracity.10 <br> <i>Veracity</i> is not the issue here, though. <i>Evidence</i> is not the issue here. <i>Reality</i> is not the issue here, either. The issue is a commandment from on high in government&#x2014;&#x201c;Islam is a religion of peace.&#x201d; It is the Big Lie that is the basis of the prevailing ideology, and, above all, the Big Lie must live. No one in the leadership contradicts it &#x201c;because then,&#x201d; as Hans Christian Andersen tells us, he would be &#x201c;unfit for his job or very stupid.&#x201d; <br>Admiral X certainly didn&#x2019;t want anyone to think that. So what did he make of his Coughlin briefing, an introduction to the central Islamic doctrine of jihad and its role in driving global jihad? How did he react to the spectacular if not shattering array of information contained in the authoritative Islamic texts and books of authentic, mainstream Islamic jurisprudence before him, which shattered the Islam-is-peace mantra? <br>He said, and I quote, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to check with my imam on that.&#x201d; <br>I was staggered when I first heard this story, and, in a way, I still am. Was the admiral kidding? Did he not have the wit to make up his own mind based on the ample, annotated, inconvenient evidence before him? Witlessness, however, wasn&#x2019;t the admiral&#x2019;s problem, just as witlessness wasn&#x2019;t the problem in the Justice and Defense Departments. If the admiral was announcing that he would be deferring to &#x201c;his imam&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, to an Islamic interpreter of things Islamic&#x2014;on the matter of Islamic war-making doctrine, there was a reason for this, and it had nothing to do with IQ. Similarly, if FBI Director Mueller and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dempsey were deferring to the wishes of an array of Muslim advocacy groups&#x2014;including groups designated by the U.S. government as Muslim Brotherhood front groups11&#x2014;regarding education about Islam, something else had rendered them, and countless others like them in military, security, and civilian leadership, incapable of assessing facts and passing judgment. <br>What was it? <br>This is the leading question that guided the research going into this book. What, in a nutshell, throughout eight years of George W. Bush and four years of Barack Obama, caused our leadership to deny and eliminate categorically the teachings of Islam from all official analysis of the global jihad that has wracked the world for decades (for centuries), and particularly since the 9/11 attacks in 2001? This omission has created a scrupulously de-Islamized, and thus truly &#x201c;warped,&#x201d; record for future historians to puzzle over. What will they make, for example, of a 2007 ninety-slide briefing on &#x201c;the surge&#x201d; in Iraq presented by counterinsurgency guru David Kilcullen that failed to mention Islam (let alone jihad war doctrine) once? Instead, the militarily, politically, and academically elite audiences for whom the presentation was created were asked to <i>&#x201c;think of the [Iraqi] environment as a sort of &#x2018;conflict ecosystem.&#x2019;&#x201d;</i>12 How will they explain Gen. Stanley McChrystal&#x2019;s 2009 &#x201c;assessment&#x201d; of the war against Islamic jihadists in Afghanistan, which, in sixty-six pages, contained not one discussion of Islam, jihad, or how they fit into both the Taliban struggle and the Afghan people&#x2019;s antipathy for Western forces? How will they explain why &#x201c;everyone&#x201d; agreed to fight blind? <br>To be fair, there is one passing reference to Islam in the McChrystal assessment. Calling for an improved communications approach, the commander demanded that insurgents and jihadist militias be &#x201c;exposed continually&#x201d; for their &#x201c;anti-Islamic&#x201d; use of violence and terror. The report elaborates, &#x201c;These include their causing of the majority of civilian casualties, attacks on education, development projects, and government institutions, <i>and flagrant contravention of the principles of the Koran</i>&#x201d; (emphasis added).13 <br>It would be easy to toss off a derisive quip at this point and move on, but it&#x2019;s well worth mulling over how it could be that eight years after 9/11, a West Point&#x2013;trained, battle-hardened, and by all accounts capable commander fighting jihad forces in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan could assume the role of an apologist for Islam rather than an expert analyst of holy war as waged against his own forces. Flagrant contravention of the Koranic principles of jihad? Au contraire. Between the Koran&#x2019;s teachings against befriending Christians and Jews (noted above) and its teachings that it is a &#x201c;grave sin for a Muslim to shirk the battle against the unbelievers,&#x201d; as the scholar and critic Ibn Warraq explains (&#x201c;those who do will roast in hell&#x201d;), it is also perfectly Islamic to wage jihad against any and all infidel &#x201c;education, development projects,&#x201d; not to mention against Muslims not actively fighting or supporting jihad.14 <br>Don&#x2019;t just take my word for it. Back in 2003, the man who used to be described as Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s &#x201c;spiritual guide&#x201d; castigated President Bush along similar lines, and rightly so. In response to Bush&#x2019;s repeated slander of the religion of jihad as the &#x201c;religion of peace,&#x201d; Abu Qatada said, &#x201c;I am astonished by President Bush when he claims there is nothing in the Koran that justifies jihad or violence in the name of Islam. Is he some kind of Islamic scholar? Has he ever actually read the Koran?&#x201d;15 <br>If Bush, or McChrystal for that matter, ever did crack the book, he read only the &#x201c;good parts&#x201d;&#x2014;the 124 verses of tolerance&#x2014;that are rendered meaningless according to the rule of &#x201c;abrogation.&#x201d; The rule of abrogation is the key that Islamic scholars use to resolve contradictions within the Koran. By means of this doctrine, Koranic passages are &#x201c;abrogated,&#x201d; or canceled, by any subsequently &#x201c;revealed&#x201d; verses that convey a different meaning. In other words, when there is a contradiction (e.g., don&#x2019;t kill the infidel vs. yes, kill the infidel), whatever was &#x201c;revealed&#x201d; to Islam&#x2019;s prophet, Mohammed, more recently trumps whatever was &#x201c;revealed&#x201d; before it. This technique comes from Mohammed himself at the Koran&#x2019;s sura 2:105: &#x201c;Whatever verses we [i.e., Allah] cancel or cause you to forget, we bring a better or its like.&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s a simple concept, unforgettable once taught&#x2014;but our elected officials, our military and other security providers, our pundits and other public voices seem never to have learned it, much less explained it to the rest of us. Or worse, they are ignoring it on purpose. In this ignorant morass, then, We, the People are left on our own to make sense of misinformation and disinformation. Why? Why haven&#x2019;t they sought and told the truth? <br>There are reasons. In his book <i>What the Koran Really Says,</i> Ibn Warraq explains that while abrogation resolves the abundant contradictions to be found in the Koran, it &#x201c;does pose problems for apologists of Islam, since all the passages preaching tolerance are found in Meccan (i.e., early) suras, and all the passages recommending killing, decapitating and maiming, the so-called Sword Verses, are Medinan (i.e., later).&#x201d; Hi...</p><h2>Meditation for the Love of It: Enjoying Your Own Deepest Experience</h2><p><p>Meditation is like a love affair with your innermost self.

Pointy black hat, maybe a broomstick. But witches in various guises have been with us for millennia. In <i>Waking the Witch</i>, Pam Grossman explores the cultural and historical impact of the world&#x2019;s most magical icon. From the idea of the <i>femme fatale</i> in league with the devil in early modern Europe and Salem, to the bewitching pop culture archetypes in <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i>, and <i>Harry Potter</i>; from the spooky ladies in fairy tales and horror films to the rise of feminist covens and contemporary witchcraft, witches reflect the power and potential of women.<br> <br>In this fascinating read that is part cultural analysis, part memoir, Pam opens up about her own journey on the path to witchcraft, and how her personal embrace of the witch helped her find strength, self-empowerment, and a deeper purpose. <br> <br>A comprehensive meditation on one of the most mysterious and captivating figures of all time, <i>Waking the Witch </i>celebrates witches past, present, and future, and reveals the critical role they have played&#x2014;and will continue to play&#x2014;in shaping the world as we know it.</p><p>Pam Grossman is the creator and host of&nbsp;<i>The Witch Wave</i>&nbsp;podcast and the author of&nbsp;<i>What Is A Witch</i>.&nbsp;She is co-founder of the Occult Humanities Conference at NYU, and her art exhibitions and magical projects have been featured in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Artforum</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker.</i>&nbsp;Her writing has appeared in such outlets&nbsp;as&nbsp;<i>Sabat Magazine</i>,&nbsp;<i>HuffPost,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;her occulture blog,&nbsp;<i>Phantasmaphile</i>.&nbsp;For her work as the Director of Visual Trends at Getty Images, she was chosen as one of&nbsp;<i>Adweek&#x2019;s&nbsp;</i>Creative 100 and&nbsp;<i>Marie Claire&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;20 Women Changing The Ratio.&#x201d;&nbsp;She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two feline familiars.

Pam reminds us of the resilience of the witch, of all we have to learn from her, and of what she has to offer us.

With rare insight and flair for nuance, <i>Waking the Witch</i> explores ambiguous territories few writers dare to tread. As only a practicing witch could do, Grossman engages the witch archetype even in the liminal spaces where she becomes most difficult.

But invention, in all art, is closely allied to technique, and technique can be taught. This book, therefore, which differs from most other texts on the subject because of its tremendous wealth of musical examples and its systematic arrangement of material according to each constituent of the orchestra, will undoubtedly be of value to any music student. It is a music classic, perhaps the only book on classical orchestration written by a major composer.<br>In it, the composer aims to provide the reader with the fundamental principles of modern orchestration from the standpoint of brilliance and imagination, and he devotes considerable space to the study of tonal resonance and orchestral combination. In his course, he demonstrates such things as how to produce a good-sounding chord of certain tone-quality, uniformly distributed; how to detach a melody from its harmonic setting; correct progression of parts; and other similar problems.<br>The first chapter is a general review of orchestral groups, with an instrument-by-instrument breakdown and material on such technical questions as fingering, range, emission of sound, etc. There follows two chapters on melody and harmony in strings, winds, brasses, and combined groups. Chapter IV, Composition of the Orchestra, covers different ways of orchestrating the same music; effects that can be achieved with full tutti; tutti in winds, tutti pizzicato, soli in the strings, etc.; chords; progressions; and so on. The last two chapters deal with opera and include discussion of solo and choral accompaniment, instruments on stage or in the wings, technical terms, soloists (range, register, vocalization, vowels, etc.), voices in combination, and choral singing. <br>Immediately following this text are some 330 pages of musical examples drawn from "Sheherazade," the "Antar Symphony," "Capriccio Espagnol," "Sadko," "Ivan the Terrible," "Le Coq d'Or," "Mlada," "The Tsar's Bride," and others of Rimsky-Korsakov's works. These excerpts are all referred to in the text itself, where they illustrate, far better than words, particular points of theory and actual musical practice. They are largely responsible for making this book the very special (and very useful) publication it is.<br>This single-volume edition also includes a brief preface by the editor and extracts from Rimsky-Korsakov's 1891 draft and final versions of his own preface, as well as an appendixed chart of single tutti chords in the composer's works.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844&#x2013;1908) was a prolific composer of orchestral works and many other forms of music, including chamber works and art songs. He also wrote many operas, excerpts from which are featured in this collection; most notably, "The Flight of the Bumblebee" from <i>The Tale of Tsar Saltan.</i></p><h2>The Four Spiritual Laws of Prosperity: A Simple Guide to Unlimited Abundance</h2><p><b>An empowering message about the true meaning of prosperity&#x2014;to help anyone achieve a life of spiritual and&nbsp;<b>material </b>abundance.</b><br><br>Imagine if you could achieve a life of true prosperity, enjoying:<br>- A vitally alive, healthy body through which you experience relationships that are always satisfying and intimate, honest, and nurturing<br>- Work you love so much that it's not work, it's play<br>- All the money you can spend<br><br>Living at this exceptional level is not only possible&#x2014;it's right there for you, Edwene Gaines explains, if only you abide by the four spiritual laws of prosperity.

But we have not yet learned one of the most important things of all: how to form a healthy attitude toward money. We have to learn to be masters of our money, and not let it be the master of us. We must realize that the power to bring about real and positive change in this world is not in gold bullion, stocks, or bonds. Instead, the power is within us, as children of God, at the level of our spirituality.<br><br>Money is a means to an end, not the end itself. You cannot eat money, and it cannot keep you warm or cuddle you at night. Simply having money is not the goal. The goal is to use it to do whatever your heart leads you to do, and to do that which fulfills your divine purpose.<br><br>Many people who attend my workshops struggle with conflicting issues of morality and money. Perhaps you do, too. Perhaps you've been brought up to believe that money is evil. Perhaps you were taught the myth of noble poverty--that good people don't dream about wealth and prosperity, because doing so is greedy. As a result, part of you chooses to remain poor, and your life feels constrained and unfulfilled. You may have a sense that your dreams will never be achieved, and you live with the fear that life is passing you by.<br><br>Then perhaps another part of you--the part that caused you to pick up this book--believes that God wants more for you, that it's not God's will for you to endlessly struggle from paycheck to paycheck. In your heart you know that God loves you and wants the best for you. You sense that God has a special plan for you, and that if only you had the financial means, you could be out in the world, doing God's work and making a positive difference in the lives of other people, as well as fully making the most of this precious life that God has blessed you with.<br><br>A lot of us are torn between these two sides of ourselves because of the contradictory messages we've gotten our whole lives concerning spirituality and money. It's no wonder that when it comes to our finances, so many people feel conflicted and confused.<br><br>LEARNING TO ACCEPT OUR DESIRES<br><br>Many people want something--a house, a car, a new pair of shoes--but feel that they can't afford it. So they feel virtuous when they let themselves off the hook by saying, "Oh, I don't really want that thing. And anyway, I shouldn't be so materialistic."<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, God doesn't love a martyr. I should know; I played one for many years. Denying our material desires is not what God wants us to do. What we could choose to do instead is grow, develop our courage and faith, and stand up and say without guilt or hesitation, "This is what I want!"<br><br>If you desire something, and then you deny that you desire it, that's cowardice and spiritual laziness. And what's more, it's a lie.<br><br>God wants us to do more, to have more, to play big. God doesn't want us to deny our desires. After all, God put those desires in us, and we must celebrate them! Life is not about struggling, and being unhappy, and then dying. It is about enjoying and appreciating everything life has to offer. Through joy, we glorify God.<br><br>These ideas may be new to you. They often are to the people who attend my seminars, and those people often have lots of questions. Let me pose some of the most common questions and share my ideas about them.<br><br>"WHAT IS MONEY, ANYWAY?"<br><br>There is a lot written about what money is. Some scholars say it is "deferred service." Some say it is energy. Some believe that money is a spiritual symbol of invisible spiritual substance. Spiritual substance is what the mystics call the invisible body of God out of which all things are created--your clothes, your jewelry, your shoes, and the chair you are sitting in. It's all created out of one invisible substance called the body of God.<br><br>Money is an energy system we are using right now, which I believe will one day disappear. Money will no longer be necessary. Because, as Charles Fillmore, the cofounder of the Unity Church, says, "We shall serve for the joy of serving." And when we do, everything that we need and want will flow to us. So we won't need money.<br><br>But money is not going to disappear until we have mastered it, until we know that there is really no power in it, that it's here as an item to serve us, and that we don't have to earn it, or struggle for it, or do anything we don't want to do to get money. We certainly don't have to work a job we hate for it.<br><br>I believe that God is not way high up, way far away. I believe God is within us. I believe God is a part of everything we see and do, no matter how mundane. And what is more mundane than money? We touch it and handle it every day, in so many big and small different ways. You carry it with you. Every single piece of our money, down to the lowly penny, has a prayer on it: In God we trust.<br><br>"IS IT GREEDY TO DESIRE MATERIAL GOODS?"<br><br>Being rich doesn't mean you're greedy or bad. Still, when we think of accumulating wealth, many of us think of Ebenezer Scrooge, counting his coins in a cold, unlit room, and we don't want to be like that. We may instinctively dislike and distrust people when we feel that they want everything for themselves, and nothing for anyone else.<br><br>But this need not be the case. Let's take as an example Oprah Winfrey, who has far, far more money than any one person could ever need or possibly spend. If great wealth is an indicator of greed, then she must be one of the greediest people on the planet. But do we think that Oprah is greedy and materialistic because she lives in lavish mansions? Of course not! We're too busy paying rapt attention to how she went to South Africa to work with AIDS orphans. We admire her for her genuine care for other people and for her giving and generous spirit.<br><br>Greed is when you say, "I want this, and I don't want you to have it." It's not greedy to say, "I want lots, and I want you to have lots, too." If you believe that there is no end to God's abundance, then everyone should have all that they want, and then more.<br><br>Money is like love: The more you give away, the more you have. Love is a limitless resource, and so is money, and both were created by God to enrich our lives and allow us to live fully, joyfully, and completely. And you're going to discover the truth of the law of compensation, that you cannot outgive God. Emerson said that: You cannot outgive God. And he was absolutely correct.<br><br>"WHAT ABOUT THE SCRIPTURAL PASSAGES THAT PREACH AGAINST MATERIALISM?"<br><br>I get this question a lot, especially regarding the passage from the Book of Mark that states that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than it is for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven.<br><br>There are a lot of different interpretations of this Scripture. One is that there was an entry gate into Jerusalem called "The Eye of the Needle" because it was so small. Camels that came along with large cargo had to be unloaded so that the camel could get through and then be reloaded on the other side. If this is the eye of the needle the Scripture is referring to-- and we do not know this conclusively--then it is merely more difficult (but not impossible) for a richly loaded camel to pass through.<br><br>I believe that sometimes you have to be willing to give up the good to receive the greater good. At some point, as we gain more and more, we realize our material possessions are not that which is truly making us happy, and we can move beyond them to another spiritual level. At that point, we unload our camels and proceed without the cargo. When we do, we are the master of the material goods, not the other way around. We do not need our material things, and we reach a place of happily letting go. You have made spiritual progress when you can have your things or not, and be happy regardless.<br><br>"If we would only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two-week vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days."<br><br>--Dorothy Canfield Fisher<br><br>I think it's interesting that there are so very many scriptural references to prosperity and yet people tend to latch on to the ones that seem to suggest the nobility of poverty. But the Bible is full of promises of prosperity and abundance--far more than admonitions that suggest the virtue of doing without.<br><br>The danger of money comes when we forget what it's there for. When it begins to cloud the parts of our lives that are much more important, such as the personal relationships we have with the people we love, or our personal relationship with God.<br><br>That's what happened to me when, at one point in my life, I married a very wealthy man. I forgot some basic truths. I forgot that money is valuable in what it can allow us to do, be, and enjoy, and instead mistook money as being valuable in and of itself.<br><br>I had come into great prosperity, but I forgot why I was on this planet. I got so wrapped up in the money and the beautiful material things I owned that I let go of the spiritual world and kind of drowned in all the luxury. My life became stale and stagnant.<br><br>Over time, the riches caused me to depart from my spiritual pathway. I lost my appreciation for the small things. And at some point the lavish house in the posh district of town came to feel like a prison. The wealth became a burden.<br><br>There is a story in the Bible of a rich young ruler who went to Jesus and asked, "What must I do to have eternal life?" and Jesus said, "Sell everything you own, give the money to the poor, and come follow me."<br><br>I finally had to admit to myself that perhaps I had entered the marriage for the wrong reasons, and the relationship ended. I left that expensive house full of beautiful furniture, leaving everything behind except the clothes on my back and some things I could put in my car. As I drove away, I felt like the rich young ruler in that I had to leave behind all my worldly goods. That was what I needed in that moment because it forced me to get back to my true nature and calling.<br><br>The mistake I think people make, however, is that they think they should always be forfeiting their material goods. But I don't believe that I--or you, or anyone--need to live a lifetime of desperation or poverty. In that moment, however, it was what I needed as a wake-up call and to keep my life from going any farther down the wrong track, away from my sense of spirituality, and what I knew to be true and important.<br><br>Once again, the issue is whether you are the master of your money, or if your money and worldly objects are the master of you. There are times in your life when you are using money as a tool to do the work you need to do on this Earth. At other times in your life, you might start getting mesmerized by the glitter of the gold, and momentarily forget what's really important to you. At those times, your money is mastering you.<br><br>"ISN'T POVERTY A VIRTUE?"<br><br>People tend to think this. But, I ask, if poverty is so great, why is a fundamental goal of the major religions to eradicate it?<br><br>I was raised in a fundamentalist faith, and I have read and reread the Bible all my life. And nowhere did I read, "Thou shalt learn to do without, to be and have less than you could, to be less than God sent you to be." Instead it says, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom," and by "kingdom," I believe Jesus meant not just the kingdom of heaven but also the joy of a life richly led right here on Earth.<br><br>During a period of terrible poverty, I went and got a red letter Bible (a Bible in which everything Jesus said was printed in red). Everything Jesus said was so positive. He urged us to ask for what we want, and to not be afraid. The stories he told were success stories, about people triumphing over incredible odds, and my thought was, I believe my loving God wants more for me in life than just a miserable existence where I don't know how I'm going to put food on the table.<br><br>Nobody wants to live in poverty. I've been there, and it's a terrible place to be. It's awful to wonder how you're going to pay the light bill or to suspect that someone might be coming to repossess your car. There's just nothing fun about it, and God wants us to have fun.<br><br>How do you live the life you're meant to live? You live real close to God. You acknowledge that you are a child of God, you're made in the image and likeness of the Most High, you're a spiritual being, and it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.<br><br>You are rich with unlimited possibility. If you don't believe that, then you are spiritually poor, and will be living in constant physical poverty. Only when you genuinely believe that you are blessed with unlimited possibility can prosperity come into your life.<br><br>"WASN'T JESUS POOR?"<br><br>This is simply not true; he did not live a life of poverty. Jesus did not carry money with him, but everything he needed was provided for him in abundance. He stayed in good homes and ate the best food.<br><br>According to Scripture, Jesus had a seamless garment. Just think of the clothes you are wearing today and how many seams they have. Can you imagine the hours of labor that must go into making a seamless garment, and what it must have been worth? At the crucifixion, the centurions cast lots to see who would get that seamless garment.<br><br>"ARE WE DRAINING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BY CONSUMING SO MUCH?"</p><h2>I Ching or Book of Changes</h2><p>At least 5000 years old, the &#34;I Ching&#34; is a book of oracles containing the whole of human experience. Used for divination, it is a method of exploring the unconscious; through the symbolism of its hexagrams we are guided towards the solution of difficult problems and life situations. It can also be read as a book of wisdom revealing the laws of life to which we must all attune ourselves if we are to live in peace and harmony.</p><p>More than just a translation, Richard Wilhelm's <i>I Ching</i> is a profound introduction to the Chinese world-view. The <i>I Ching</i> (<i>Yi Jing</i>) is recognized by both Confucians and Taoists as a foundational work, and Wilhelm shows why. He separates his work into three books. The first book is about the hexagrams--the meanings of the lines and Wilhelm's extensive comments. The second presents two early commentaries that interpret the wisdom of the divinatory text, also with Wilhelm's helpful notes. And the third book takes us back to the hexagrams for more detailed commentary from both ancient Chinese thinkers and Wilhelm. Wilhelm is able to offer such enormous assistance because he spent the better part of a decade in China studying under classically trained scholars. His love for the work is thus as broad as his understanding. <p> The <i>I Ching</i> was originally used for divination, kind of like palm reading or interpreting the stars. It differs from simple prognostication, however, in that it demands us, as diviners, to cultivate an understanding of the world and ourselves. Without this understanding, the text is useless, hence the value of the commentaries, particularly Wilhelm's. This version is not without its biases, of course--it is a European's understanding of the <i>I Ching</i>, through a late-Qing dynasty Confucian perspective, translated into English by a Jungian psychoanalyst. Nonetheless, it succeeds like no other. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Princeton's Bollingen edition--still regarded as the best and most authentic by <i>I Ching</i> aficionados.

Narrator Cassandra Campbell handles the emotional roller coaster of Page&#39;s plight with aplomb, squeezing every ounce of sympathy possible from the runaway mom.

The Woman in White famously opens with Walter Hartright&#39;s eerie encounter on a moonlit London road. Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter is drawn into the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his &#39;charming&#39; friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, The Woman in White is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism.</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Science of Evil</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking and challenging examination of the social, cognitive, neurological, and biological roots of psychopathy, cruelty, and evil</b><b><br></b>Borderline personality disorder, autism, narcissism, psychosis: All of these syndromes have one thing in common--lack of empathy.

As Tickle writes in her introduction, "prayer is always a place as well as an action, and the daily offices are like small chapels or wayside stations within the day's courses." Seven of these daily offices are offered for each day of the week, and each office contains the Call to Prayer, the Request for Presence, the Greeting, the Reading, the Gloria, the Psalm, the Small Verse, the Lord's Prayer, the Petition, and the Final Thanksgiving. Tickle draws her texts primarily from the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> and the writings of the Church Fathers, and includes memorable devotional and meditative poems by Cleland McAfee, Charles Wesley, and others. Tickle also provides a chapter of "Traditional, Seasonal, and Occasional Prayers" in order to accommodate special dates like Advent, Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving; major life-changes such as marriage, birth, death, and illness; and moments of special petition or thanksgiving. <br> For all those who want to carry a "small chapel" of prayers with them, <em>The Divine Hours Pocket Edition</em>TM offers a convenient, easy-to-use, and deeply spiritual guide to a devotional practice that extends all the way back to Christ and the twelve Apostles.<br></p><p>"A welcome remedy for the increasing number of lay Christians who have rediscovered the daily offices. Tickle puts each day's prayers, psalms, readings, and refrains-everything you need-in one place. The rhythm that Tickle's book establishes gives one a stronger sense of participating in an ancient, worldwide but very personal liturgy."<br>-Nora Gallagher, "beliefnet.com, and author of "Things Seen and Unseen: A Year Lived in Faith <br>The third and final volume in a trilogy of prayer manuals compiled by "Publishers Weekly religion editor Phyllis Tickle as a contemporary Book of Hours to guide Christians gently yet authoritatively through the daily offices. <br>"The Divine Hours is the first major literary and liturgical reworking of the sixth-century Benedictine Rule of fixed-hour prayer. This beautifully conceived and thoroughly modern three-volume guide will appeal to the theological novice as well as to the ecclesiastical sophisticate. Making primary use of the Book of Common Prayer and the writings of the Church Fathers, "The Divine Hours is also a companion to the New Jerusalem Bible, from which it draws its Scripture readings. The trilogy blends prayer and praise in a way that, while extraordinarily fresh, respects and builds upon the ancient wisdom of Christianity. <br>The third and final book in the set, "Prayers for Springtime, provides prayers, psalms, and readings for this season associated with rebirth.

The first half of the book deals with classical physical optics; the second principally with the quantum nature of light. Chapters 1 and 2 treat the propagation of light waves, including the concepts of phase and group velocities, and the vectorial nature of light. Chapter 3 applies the concepts of partial coherence and coherence length to the study of interference, and Chapter 4 takes up multiple-beam interference and includes Fabry-Perot interferometry and multilayer-film theory. Diffraction and holography are the subjects of Chapter 5, and the propagation of light in material media (including crystal and nonlinear optics) are central to Chapter 6. Chapters 7 and 8 introduce the quantum theory of light and elementary optical spectra, and Chapter 9 explores the theory of light amplification and lasers. Chapter 10 briefly outlines ray optics in order to introduce students to the matrix method for treating optical systems and to apply the ray matrix to the study of laser resonators.<br>Many applications of the laser to the study of optics are integrated throughout the text. The author assumes students have had an intermediate course in electricity and magnetism and some advanced mathematics beyond calculus.

Starting with the colony of Saint Caroline, founded by French Huguenots near what is today Jacksonville, FL, in 1565, the short tales proceed chronologically to the election of 2000. Along the way, readers move through sections entitled Settlement and Colonies (1565-1778), A New Republic (1791-1863), Expansion and Invention (1867-1899), Becoming Modern (1900-1945), and Brave New World (1946-2000). The tales are pulled from politics and government, social and religious life, recreation and science. Students will hear about personalities as various as John Chapman, Carrie Nation, Typhoid Mary, Babe Ruth, and Maya Lin. An excellent classroom resource, the stories are a perfect way to fill the odd three or four minutes, and the book's organizational structure ties in well with more comprehensive titles, such as Robert D. Johnston's <i>The Making of America</i> (National Geographic, 2002). The selections are cross-referenced into Story Arcs so that readers can follow historical threads, such as immigration or science and technology. The lively prose is matched by numerous soft color illustrations. A grand way to introduce children to the history of their country.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bullying has morphed into the left&#x2019;s go-to tactic, as they attempt to quash their opponents through fear, threat of force, violence, and rhetorical intimidation on every major issue facing America today.<br> <br>In <i>Bullies</i>, Ben Shapiro uncovers the simple strategy used by liberals and their friends in the media: bully the living hell out of conservatives. Play the race card, the class card, the sexism card. Use any and every means at your disposal to demonize your opposition&#x2014;to shut them up. Then pretend that such bullying is justified, because, after all, conservatives are the true bullies, and need to be taught a lesson for their intolerance. Hidden beneath the left&#x2019;s supposed hatred of bullying lies a passionate love of its vulgar tactics.<br> <br>Dubbed by Glenn Beck &#x201c;a warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate��,&#x201d; Shapiro takes on the leftist bullies&#x2014;the most despicable people in America. By exposing their hypocrisy, he offers conservatives a reality check in the face of what has become the gravest threat to American liberty: the left&#x2019;s single-minded focus on ending political debate through bully tactics.</p><p>Benjamin Shapiro entered UCLA at the age of sixteen and graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in June 2004 with a BA in political science. He graduated Harvard Law School cum laude in June 2007. The author of the national bestsellers, <i>Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America&#x2019;s Youth</i>, <i>Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future</i>, and <i>Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House</i>, Shapiro has appeared on hundreds of radio and&nbsp;TV shows around the nation. He is married and currently runs Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting, based in Los Angeles. He is editor-at-large of Breitbart.com.Bullies 1.<br>INSTITUTIONAL BULLIES<br> For decades, the biggest problem for conservatives&#x2014;and the biggest advantage for liberals&#x2014;has been the fact that conservatives think individually, while liberals think institutionally. Think about politics in terms of religious outreach. Conservatives are like Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, going door to door, trying to convince people of the truth of their teachings. Liberals are like radical Muslims, toppling governments and installing shariah law, then forcibly converting enormous masses of the population.<br><br> That&#x2019;s why all the major instruments of political persuasion are in the hands of liberals. And it&#x2019;s also why liberalism, though almost invariably based on pernicious and dangerous misinterpretation at best, and outright falsehood at worst, has been ascendant in America for the last hundred years.<br><br> Look at every major bully move by the left over the past few decades and you&#x2019;ll be able to spot the coordination between the left&#x2019;s instruments. The politicians and regulators work with the unions; the unions work with the journalists; the journalists work with the Hollywood clique; the Hollywood clique works with the leftist charitable foundations; the leftist charitable foundations work with the university professors; the university professors work with the judges. And all of them work with each other.<br><br> There is only one way to make an institution conservativerein. It has to be purged.<br><br> Now, in America, we generally don&#x2019;t look fondly on Soviet-style purges, complete with gulags and hastily dug graves. And so the American left has stayed away from that sort of thing. The left has taken advantage, however, of the American freedom to employ and work with whom you choose. The left doesn&#x2019;t do anything illegal in preventing their ideological opponents from working. They just do something tremendously immoral&#x2014;and unbelievably hypocritical, considering that they want private religious schools to have to employ transvestites who show up one day wearing a feather boa and a tutu.<br><br> To understand just how the system of bullying works, we need to explore how the left took over the institutions that enable that bullying&#x2014;and we have to take a look at how the current system works. &nbsp;</p><h2>Vision In Silver (A Novel of the Others)</h2><p><b>Follow<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author Anne Bishop to a &#x201c;stunningly original&#x201d;(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) world of magic and political unrest&#x2014;where the only chance at peace requires a deadly price&#x2014;in the third Novel of the Others.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The Others freed the blood prophets to protect them from exploitation, but their actions had dire consequences.

She gave the humans fertile pieces of herself, and she gave them good water. Understanding their nature and the nature of her other offspring, she also gave them enough isolation that they would have a chance to survive and grow. And they did.</p><p>They learned to build fires and shelters. They learned to farm and build cities. They built boats and fished in the Mediterran and Black seas. They bred and spread throughout their pieces of the world until they pushed into the wild places. That&#x2019;s when they discovered that Namid&#x2019;s other offspring already claimed the rest of the world.</p><p>The Others looked at humans and did not see conquerors. They saw a new kind of meat.</p><p>Wars were fought to possess the wild places. Sometimes the humans won and spread their seed a little farther. More often, pieces of civilization disappeared, and fearful survivors tried not to shiver when a howl went up in the night or a man, wandering too far from the safety of stout doors and light, was found the next morning drained of blood.</p><p>Centuries passed, and the humans built larger ships and sailed across the Atlantik Ocean. When they found virgin land, they built a settlement near the shore. Then they discovered that this land was also claimed by the <i>terra indigene</i>, the earth natives. The Others.</p><p>The <i>terra indigene </i>who ruled the continent called Thaisia became angry when the humans cut down trees and put a plow to land that was not theirs. So the Others ate the settlers and learned the shape of this particular meat, just as they had done many times in the past.</p><p>The second wave of explorers and settlers found the abandoned settlement and, once more, tried to claim the land as their own.</p><p>The Others ate them too.</p><p>The third wave of settlers had a leader who was smarter than his predecessors. He offered the Others warm blankets and lengths of cloth for clothes and interesting bits of shiny in exchange for being allowed to live in the settlement and have enough land to grow crops. The Others thought this was a fair exchange and walked off the boundaries of the land that the humans could use. More gifts were exchanged for hunting and fishing privileges. This arrangement satisfied both sides, even if one side regarded its new neighbors with snarling tolerance and the other side swallowed fear and made sure its people were safely inside the settlement&#x2019;s walls before nightfall.</p><p>Years passed and more settlers arrived. Many died, but enough humans prospered. Settlements grew into villages, which grew into towns, which grew into cities. Little by little, humans moved across Thaisia, spreading out as much as they could on the land they were allowed to use.</p><p>Centuries passed. Humans were smart. So were the Others. Humans invented electricity and plumbing. The Others controlled all the rivers that could power the generators and all the lakes that supplied fresh drinking water. Humans invented steam engines and central heating. The Others controlled all the fuel needed to run the engines and heat the buildings. Humans invented and manufactured products. The Others controlled all the natural resources, thereby deciding what would and wouldn&#x2019;t be made in their part of the world.</p><p>There were collisions, of course, and some places became dark memorials for the dead. Those memorials finally made it clear to human government that the <i>terra indigene</i> ruled Thaisia, and nothing short of the end of the world would change that.</p><p>So it comes to this current age. Small human villages exist within vast tracts of land that belong to the Others. And in larger human cities, there are fenced parks called Courtyards that are inhabited by the Others who have the task of keeping watch over the city&#x2019;s residents and enforcing the agreements the humans made with the <i>terra indigene</i>.</p><p>There is still sharp-toothed tolerance on one side and fear of what walks in the dark on the other. But if they are careful, the humans survive.</p><p>Most of the time, they survive.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Thaisday, Maius 10</p><p>Meg Corbyn entered the bathroom in the Human Liaison&#x2019;s Office and laid out the items she&#x2019;d labeled the tools of prophecy: antiseptic ointment, bandages, and the silver folding razor decorated with pretty leaves and flowers on one side of the handle. On the other side of the handle, engraved in plain lettering, was the designation <i>cs759</i>. For twenty-four years, that designation had been the closest thing she&#x2019;d had to a name.</p><p>She had a name now and a real apartment instead of a sterile cell. In the compound where she had been raised and trained&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and used&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she&#x2019;d had one friend: Jean, the girl who wouldn&#x2019;t allow anyone to forget that she&#x2019;d once had a home and a family outside the compound&#x2014;the girl who had helped Meg escape.</p><p>Now Meg had many friends, and it didn&#x2019;t matter to her that most of them weren&#x2019;t human. The <i>terra indigene </i>had given her a chance to have a life, were helping her find ways to live with the addiction that would eventually kill her. But Simon Wolfgard, leader of the Lakeside Courtyard, insisted he&#x2019;d seen someone like her who had survived long enough to become an old woman.</p><p>She wanted to believe that was possible. She hoped this morning&#x2019;s experiment might provide a clue to how it was possible.</p><p>After checking to make sure she hadn&#x2019;t forgotten anything they would need, Meg sat on the closed toilet seat and waited for Merri Lee, the human friend who was learning to work as her listener and interpreter.</p><p>The <i>cassandra sangue </i>saw prophecies when their skin was cut. They were trained to describe the visions and images. But the girls weren&#x2019;t taught how to interpret what they saw. That would have been pointless. The moment a girl began to speak, a euphoria filled her, veiling her mind and protecting her from what those images revealed. In fact, the only way a blood prophet <i>could </i>remember what she saw was to keep silent. If she didn&#x2019;t say the words out loud, she remembered what she saw.</p><p>It took a particular kind of determination&#x2014;or desperation&#x2014;to endure the agony that filled a girl when she didn&#x2019;t speak after her skin was cut. And experiencing the euphoria that was almost orgasmic was the whole reason <i>cassandra sangue </i>became addicted to the cutting in the first place.</p><p>It took a particular kind of courage to acknowledge that she couldn&#x2019;t completely escape the addiction after so many years of being cut on a regular schedule for someone else&#x2019;s profit. The prophecies inside her would not be denied. Whether she wanted to or not, Meg <i>needed </i>to cut.</p><p>That was the reason today&#x2019;s appointment with the razor was so important. She wasn&#x2019;t experiencing the pins-and-needles feeling that indicated something was going to happen. Nothing pushed at her, and that made this morning the perfect time to discover what happened when she made a controlled cut.</p><p>The back door of the office opened. A moment later, Merri Lee stood in the bathroom doorway holding a small pad of paper and a pen.</p><p>They were both petite women around the same age, and both had fair skin. But Merri Lee had dark eyes and dark, layered hair that fell below her shoulders, while Meg had clear gray eyes and short black hair that was still mostly a weird orangey red from her efforts to disguise herself when she&#x2019;d run away from the man known as the Controller.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure about this?&#x201d; Merri Lee asked. &#x201c;Maybe we should wait until Simon and Henry get back from Great Island.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg shook her head. &#x201c;We should do this now, before the office opens and there&#x2019;s additional&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. input&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that might change what I see. Vlad is working at Howling Good Reads today. We can tell him about the prophecy&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s close enough if we need help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; Merri Lee pulled over a chair from the little dining area, set it just outside the bathroom doorway, and sat down. &#x201c;What should I ask you?&#x201d;</p><p>Meg had thought about this. When clients had come to the Controller&#x2019;s compound, they had a specific question. She wasn&#x2019;t looking for anything that defined, but she needed <i>some </i>kind of boundary. &#x201c;This is what you should ask: What should the residents of the Lakeside Courtyard watch for during the next fortnight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty vague,&#x201d; Merri Lee said. &#x201c;And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fortnight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I ask about a specific thing in the Courtyard, something else might be overlooked&#x2014;and <i>that </i>might be the important thing the Others should know about,&#x201d; Meg replied. &#x201c;Two weeks is enough time. As for &#x2018;fortnight,&#x2019; I just learned that word and like the sound of it. I think it fits in with prophecies better than saying &#x2018;two weeks.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But if this doesn&#x2019;t work, if we don&#x2019;t get anything useful, then you&#x2019;ve made the cut for nothing,&#x201d; Merri Lee argued.</p><p>&#x201c;Not for nothing,&#x201d; Meg said. The euphoria was reason enough to cut. That wasn&#x2019;t something she would say to her friend, so she offered a different truth. &#x201c;If I can stretch out the time between cuts because one cut will supply the warnings we need for two weeks and quiet the pins-and-needles feeling that pushes me to cut, I&#x2019;ll have more years to live. And I do want to live&#x2014;especially now that I have a real life.&#x201d;</p><p>A beat of silence. Then Merri Lee said, &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Opening the silver razor, Meg laid the blade flat against her skin, its one-quarter-inch width providing the perfect distance between cuts&#x2014;the distance that kept prophecies separated without wasting valuable skin. She lined up the back of the blade with the last scar on her left forearm. Then she turned her hand and cut just deeply enough for blood to flow freely and, equally important, for the cut to leave a scar.</p><p>Agony filled her, the prelude to prophecy. Hearing someone crying&#x2014;someone no one else could hear&#x2014;Meg gritted her teeth, set the razor aside, and positioned her arm to rest in the bathroom sink. Then she gave Merri Lee a sharp nod.</p><p>&#x201c;What should the residents of the Lakeside Courtyard watch for during the next fortnight?&#x201d; Merri Lee said. &#x201c;Speak, prophet, and I will listen.&#x201d;</p><p>She spoke, revealing everything she saw. The images faded with the sound of the words as waves of euphoria produced a delicious tingle in her breasts and a rhythmic tug between her legs, replacing the pain.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know how long she floated on the pleasure produced by the euphoria. Sometimes it seemed to fade within moments of identifying the last image, while at other times she drifted for a while in a haze of physical pleasure. When she became aware of her surroundings again, Meg realized enough time had passed that Merri Lee had bandaged the cut, cleaned the razor, and washed the sink.</p><p>The blood of the <i>cassandra sangue</i> was dangerous to humans and Others alike. It had been used to make gone over wolf and feel-good, two drugs that had caused so much trouble throughout Thaisia in the past few months. That was the reason why, when they made plans for this cut, she and Merri Lee agreed that all the blood would be washed away, and the bandages would be collected later and taken to the Courtyard&#x2019;s Utilities Complex for incineration.</p><p>&#x201c;Did it work?&#x201d; Meg asked. &#x201c;Did I speak prophecy? Did I see anything useful?&#x201d; Her voice sounded rough, and her throat hurt. She wanted to ask Merri Lee for a glass of water or maybe some juice, but she couldn&#x2019;t rouse herself enough to say anything more.</p><p>&#x201c;Meg, do you trust me?&#x201d;</p><p>That sounded like an ominous way to answer her own questions. &#x201c;Yes, I trust you.&#x201d;</p><p>Merri Lee nodded, as if coming to a decision. &#x201c;Yes, it worked. Better than we could have hoped. I need a little time to sort the images into some kind of order.&#x201d;</p><p>Not a lie, exactly, but not the truth either.</p><p>Meg studied her friend. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to tell me what I said, what I saw.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t. I really don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Meg.&#x201d;</i> Merri Lee closed her eyes for a moment. &#x201c;No one in the Courtyard is in immediate danger, but you said a couple of things that were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. disturbing, things I&#x2019;m not sure how to interpret. I want to do a preliminary shuffling of images, like we did the last time when we drew the images on index cards and kept arranging them until they told us a story. Then I&#x2019;ll go to Howling Good Reads and talk to Vlad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see anything bad happening to Sam? Or Simon? Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyone here?&#x201d; In human form, Sam Wolfgard looked to be around eight or nine years old now, but he was still a puppy. And Simon was her friend. Just the thought of something happening to either of them made her chest hurt.</p><p>Merri Lee shook her head. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say anything that would indicate someone here was going to be in trouble.&#x201d; She touched Meg&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re both learning how to do this, and I want someone else&#x2019;s feedback before you and I talk about what you saw. Okay?&#x201d;</p><p>No immediate danger. None of her friends at risk. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost nine o&#x2019;clock. You should eat something before you open the office.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg followed Merri Lee out of the bathroom, feeling a little light-headed. Yes, she needed to eat, needed a little quiet time. Needed to figure out what to say to whichever Wolf had guard duty today. Even if she tried to avoid him, the Wolf would smell the blood and ointment. She was pretty sure she could talk John into not sounding an alarm, and if it was Skippy&#x2019;s turn as watch Wolf, a couple of cookies would distract him. On the other hand, if Blair, the Courtyard&#x2019;s primary enforcer, showed up with Skippy, as he usually did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Maybe Merri Lee was right about telling Vlad before someone started howling about the cut and brought <i>everyone </i>running to demand answers.</p><p>&#x201c;Merri?&#x201d; Meg said as Merri Lee opened the office&#x2019;s back door. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see anything else about the Others?&#x201d;</p><p>Merri Lee shook her head. Then she frowned. &#x201c;Well, you did see paws digging.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Digging?&#x201d; Now Meg frowned. &#x201c;Why would that be important enough to see in a vision?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Maybe Vlad or the Wolves will be able to figure it out.&#x201d; Merri Lee hesitated. &#x201c;Will you be all right? You&#x2019;re not dizzy or anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remember to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;</p><p>As soon as Merri Lee closed t...</p></p><h2>Descender Volume 6: The Machine War (Descender, 6)</h2><p>A new, cataclysmic chapter of the Descender saga is here!

Their work has made <em>A Garden of Pomegranates</em>easier to understand, more complete, and up to date. It now includes over 300 pages of never-before-published information from two Senior Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.</p> <ul> <li>Expands Regardie's definitive text into a practical manual for Qabalistic magic</li> <li>Includes pathworkings and guided visualizations for the 32 Paths of Wisdom</li> <li>Suggests a course of study for learning the Qabalah and incorporating its teachings into daily life</li> <li>Shows how to create your own personal Qabalistic mantra using gematria or Hebrew numerology</li> <li>Includes a technique for Rising on the Planes, so you can explore different Qabalistic worlds</li> <li>Features a Middle Pillar-style exercise for exploring and activating different parts of the soul</li> <li>Written by one of the most influential magical teachers of modern times and two of his personal students</li> </ul> <p>The Qabalah is the ancient system of Hebrew mysticism that is the foundation of Western magical and esoteric studies. Its primary symbol is the Tree of Life, a diagram that can aid in the study of the nature of the Universe, the essence of God, and the human mind, spirit, and soul. <em>A Garden of Pomegranates</em> is the clearest introductory guide on this subject.</p> <p>When Israel Regardie wrote <em>A Garden of Pomegranates</em> in 1932, he designed it to be a simple yet comprehensive guidebook outlining the complex system of the Qabalah and providing a key to its symbolism. Since then, it has achieved the status of a classic among texts on the Qabalah. The full annotations, critical commentary, and explanatory notes now make this book the ultimate single resource on the subject. The new material, including pathworkings, exercises, daily affirmations, rituals, meditations, and more, not only complement the original, full text included in this edition, but also make <em>A Garden of Pomegranates</em> indispensable for modern magicians.</p></p><p>Is it possible to make a classic better? Most authors think so. That's why they often produce new editions of their works. <i>A Garden of Pomegranates</i> by Israel Regardie went into its second edition over 30 years ago. For it, Regardie gave a new introduction, explaining some of the comments he had made in the first edition some 40 years earlier. <br> <br>Regardie is no longer with us, and we felt that <i>A Garden of Pomegranates </i>needed an updating. Books written for an audience of 70 years ago don't always meet the needs of people today. Luckily, Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero, Senior Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and students of Regardie, were more than up to the task&#x2014;and what an incredible job they have done. <br> <br><i>A Garden of Pomegranates </i>is the classic introduction to the magical Qabalah. The Ciceros have redrawn all of the original diagrams and added a score of notes, as well as a glossary, a bibliography, and an index to make finding information easier than ever. Plus, they have added more than 300 pages of additional material on working with the Tree of Life that can be put into use no matter what your level of experience. <br> <br>Previously, <i>A Garden of Pomegranates</i> was one of the most important Qabalistic guides for the twentieth century. With the new edition, it is now the classic you must get for the new millennium. <br>Francis I.

Schlesinger</p><h2>Paprika (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p>Widely acknowledged as Yasutaka Tsutsui's masterpiece, <i>Paprika</i> unites his surreal, quirky imagination with a mind-bending narrative about a psychiatric institute that has developed the technology to invade people's dreams.<br><br> When prototype models of a dream-invading device go missing at the Institute for Psychiatric Research, it transpires that someone is using them to drive people insane. Threatened both personally and professionally, brilliant psychotherapist Atsuko Chiba has to journey into the world of fantasy to fight her mysterious opponents. As she delves ever deeper into the imagination, the borderline between dream and reality becomes increasingly blurred, and nightmares begin to leak into the everyday realm. The scene is set for a final showdown between the dream detective and her enemies, with the subconscious as their battleground, and the future of the waking world at stake.</p><p>One of modern Japan's most renowned writers, <b>Yasutaka Tsutsui</b>&nbsp;has won the Tanizaki Prize, the Kawabata Prize, and several other awards. He was decorated as a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.1<br><br>Kosaku Tokita lumbered into the Senior Staff Room. He must have weighed at least two hundred fifty pounds. The air in the room grew hot and stuffy.<br><br>The Senior Staff Room of the Institute for Psychiatric Research had five desks but only two regular occupants &#x2013; Kosaku Tokita and Atsuko Chiba. Their desks jostled for space near the window at the far end of the room. The Senior Staff Room was separated from the Junior Staff Room by a glass door, but as the door was always left open, each just felt like an extension of the other.<br><br>The sandwiches and coffee she&#x2019;d brought from the Institute shop were still sitting on Atsuko Chiba&#x2019;s desk. She had no appetite today; it was always the same old thing for lunch. The Institute had a canteen, used by staff and patients alike, but the meals it served were like horse feed. On the bright side, Atsuko&#x2019;s lack of appetite meant she never had to gain weight or compromise her good looks &#x2013; looks that had TV stations begging for her on an almost daily basis. But then again, barring their merits when treating patients, Atsuko had no interest at all in her own good looks or her TV appearances.<br><br>&#x201c;The staff are having kittens,&#x201d; Tokita lisped as he lowered his bulky frame next to her. One of the therapists had gone down with paranoid delusions. &#x201c;They say it&#x2019;s contagious schizophrenia. None of them want to touch the scanners or reflectors.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is a worry,&#x201d; said Atsuko. She herself often had such experiences. After all, psychiatrists had always been afraid of catching personality disorders from their patients; some even claimed that mental illness could be transmitted through the mucous membranes, like herpes. Ever since psychotherapy or &#x201c;PT&#x201d; devices had first come into use &#x2013; particularly the scanners and reflectors that scanned and observed the inside of the psyche &#x2013; this fear had come to assume an air of reality. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ones who don&#x2019;t like identifying with their patients, the ones who pass on, who tend to worry about that kind of thing. Pff. You&#x2019;d think an experience like that would give them a chance to self-diagnose as psychotherapists.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Passing on&#x201d; meant blaming it on the patient&#x2019;s mental disorder when a therapist was unable to forge human bonds with a patient. It had been at the very root of schizophrenic diagnosis until just two decades earlier.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no! Not chopped burdock with sesame and marinated pan-fried chicken yuan style, AGAIN!&#x201d; Tokita thrust out his thick lower lip in disgust as he opened the lid of the bento lunch box prepared by his mother. Tokita lived alone with his mother in one of the Institute&#x2019;s apartments. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t eat that!&#x201d;<br><br>Atsuko&#x2019;s appetite was duly aroused when she peered into Tokita&#x2019;s sizable lunch box. For this was surely a nori bento &#x2013; a thin layer of rice at the bottom, topped by a single sheet of dried nori seaweed moistened with soy sauce, with alternating layers of rice and nori on top of that . . . A classic nori bento from the good old days! To Atsuko, the box was crammed full of the home-cooked delights she craved, the taste of her mother&#x2019;s food. She hadn&#x2019;t always been one to skimp on meals, after all. In fact, she actually felt quite hungry now.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;ll eat it for you,&#x201d; she said decisively, her hands already stretched out to receive. And with both of those hands she went to grab Tokita&#x2019;s large bamboo lunch box from the side.<br><br>Tokita&#x2019;s reaction was equally swift. &#x201c;No way!&#x201d; he cried, pinning her hands down on top of the box.<br><br>&#x201c;But you said you didn&#x2019;t want it!&#x201d; Atsuko protested as she tried to prise the box from his grasp. She had a certain confidence in the strength of her fingertips.<br><br>Apart from this lunch box, there was nothing at all in the Institute that could satisfy Tokita&#x2019;s appetite or suit his palate. He too was desperate. &#x201c;I said no way!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.&#x201d; Torataro Shima, the Institute Administrator, stood before them with a frown. &#x201c;Our two top candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, fighting over a lunch box?!&#x201d; he said with a hint of sadness.<br><br>Torataro Shima had a habit of getting up from his desk in the Administrator&#x2019;s Office, casually strolling around the Junior Staff Room and speaking to anyone he found there. Some of the staff would jump up in fright when he suddenly spoke to them from behind; some pointed out that it was not terribly good for the heart.<br><br>Even addressed thus with such distortion of mouth and such heavy sarcasm by the Institute Administrator, the pair refused to relinquish their grip on the lunch box, and merely continued their struggle in silence. For a few moments, Shima simply stared at the spectacle with an expression of pity. Then he gave two or three little nods of his head in resignation &#x2013; as if he&#x2019;d just remembered that genius always goes hand in hand with infantile behavior.<br><br>&#x201c;Doctor Chiba. Please come to my office later,&#x201d; he muttered, then clasped his hands behind his rounded back, turned and started to walk aimlessly around the Junior Staff Room as usual.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, it can&#x2019;t be good for people who are supposed to be treating patients to have the same disorders as them, can it,&#x201d; Tokita continued after reluctantly portioning out half of his lunch into the lid of the box. &#x201c;Tsumura misunderstood the patient&#x2019;s attempt at transcendental independence as an attempt at empirical independence. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for a patient&#x2019;s family to have the same delusions as the patient. This is similar, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>In that case, the danger was even greater. Because, in the eyes of the patient, it would certainly have been seen as an attempt to deceive &#x2013; just as patients feel tricked by family members who express understanding of their condition. Atsuko realized she would have to analyze the therapist called Tsumura.<br><br>Atsuko only ever went to the Senior Staff Room for her lunch. Her laboratory was so full of PT devices as to resemble the cockpit of an airplane; she couldn&#x2019;t relax there, with assistants incessantly walking in and out. The same was sure to be true of Tokita&#x2019;s lab.<br><br>As she made her way back, Atsuko could see, through the open door of the General Treatment Room, four or five staff members clamoring loudly as they stood around Tsumura. This must have been what Tokita meant by &#x201c;having kittens&#x201d; &#x2013; and it was a fair description of their appearance. Tsumura had his right arm raised as if in a Nazi salute, and some of the others who surrounded him in altercation also did the same. Atsuko felt sure that there would normally be nothing to make such a fuss about; something unnatural was going on.<br><br>Back in Atsuko&#x2019;s lab, her young assistant Nobue Kakimoto was peering at a display screen with a helmet-shaped collector attached to her head. She was monitoring the dream of a patient who slept in the adjacent examination room. Nobue&#x2019;s expression was vacant; she was quite unaware that Atsuko had returned.<br><br>Atsuko quickly stopped the recording, then pressed the &#x201c;back-skip&#x201d; button two or three times. Switching the machine off altogether could have been dangerous, as Nobue might then have been trapped inside the patient&#x2019;s subconscious. The picture on the screen started to flip backward through the patient&#x2019;s dream.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; Nobue came to her senses and removed the collector with some haste. Noticing Atsuko, she stood up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you realize how dangerous that could have been?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Nobue seemed unaware that she&#x2019;d strayed into the patient&#x2019;s dream. &#x201c;I only meant to be an objective observer . . . &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. You were being counter-invaded. It&#x2019;s dangerous to wear the collector for long periods when monitoring dreams. I&#x2019;ve told you that before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but . . . &#x201d; Nobue looked up at Atsuko with an expression of discontent.<br><br>Atsuko laughed aloud. &#x201c;You were trying to copy me, weren&#x2019;t you! Going into a state of semi-sleep?!&#x201d;<br><br>Nobue reluctantly returned to her seat and began to watch the reflector monitor. &#x201c;Why can you do it, but not me?&#x201d; she said dolefully. &#x201c;Is it because I haven&#x2019;t had enough training?&#x201d;<br><br>The truth of the matter, quite decidedly, lay not in training but in Nobue&#x2019;s lack of willpower. Some had the willpower to become therapists, for sure, but were not adept at time-sharing patients&#x2019; dreams or transferring emotions into their subconscious. If they were to attempt this, they would merely become trapped inside the patient&#x2019;s subconscious, unable to return to the real world.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps. Anyway, please be careful. Tsumura was affected by a patient&#x2019;s paranoid delusions just by looking at the reflector. You must have heard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I heard.&#x201d;<br><br>The patient in the examination room was a man of about sixty. He was dreaming of a busy street reminiscent of central Tokyo some decades earlier. The street in the patient&#x2019;s dream was vulgar, charmless, desolate. By transferring emotions to the patient using the collector, that busy street could be turned into a pleasant, desirable place, one that could be linked to the innocent erotic desires of his youth. Or the scene could take him back to a past time when he&#x2019;d enjoyed a positive relationship with society, symbolizing his need to reforge bonds with the people around him.<br><br>Atsuko was about to ask Nobue to call Tsumura when young Morio Osanai walked in. Dangerously handsome, unmarried, and already a Doctor of Medicine, he was the target of fervent gossip among the Institute&#x2019;s female staff. But he had a poor reputation, for all that, as he tended to neglect his research in favor of politics. Nobue appeared to dislike him.<br><br>&#x201c;Doctor Chiba,&#x201d; he started unceremoniously. &#x201c;About Tsumura. I wonder if the problem isn&#x2019;t Tsumura himself, but lies rather in the reflector?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it does. Tsumura would never have gone that way if he hadn&#x2019;t messed about with the reflector.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right, right. So there are some therapists who aren&#x2019;t affected by a patient&#x2019;s paranoid delusions, even if they mess about with the reflector?&#x201d; Osanai answered with a smile, as if to say &#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d say that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know that already, so don&#x2019;t bother saying it,&#x201d; Nobue spat out with venom. She had almost complete faith in Atsuko.<br><br>But Atsuko had no desire at all to become embroiled in such a low-level debate. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be forgetting the governing principle of our research here, will you,&#x201d; she said, measuring the words out slowly and deliberately.<br><br>&#x201c;To . . . develop . . . PT . . . devices. Why, yes. I know all about that,&#x201d; Osanai said slowly and deliberately in imitation of Atsuko, completely ignoring Nobue. &#x201c;What I&#x2019;m talking about is the actual effect of us observing the subconscious of a schizophrenic as an image on a screen. Schizophrenics make no attempt to disguise their subconscious, as psychopathics do. On the contrary, they express their subconscious as it is, in loud and sonorous voices. They play it out as it is. And in any case, I can&#x2019;t see there&#x2019;s any great value in peeping into their subconscious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Their subconscious is the subconscious of the schizophrenic. Surely we have to investigate the abnormal way in which they associate signifiant with signifi�? As you say, these patients are expressing their subconscious as it is. Therefore, we won&#x2019;t know what meanings are tied to their words unless we &#x2018;peep into their subconscious&#x2019;, will we.&#x201d;<br><br>Atsuko was getting serious now. Having had his say, Osanai merely looked out of the window with a smile, pretending not to listen at all. Outside the window lay about an acre of lawns, beyond them a plantation of trees designed to hide the Institute&#x2019;s perimeter fence, and beyond that, clusters of high-rise buildings in the center of the metropolis.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s your theory,&#x201d; said Osanai, with the implied addendum &#x201c;and I think it&#x2019;s rubbish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now wait a minute,&#x201d; said Atsuko, controlling her anger. Controlling anger was part of Atsuko&#x2019;s self-training as a top-grade psychotherapist. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just a theory, it&#x2019;s the very foundation of our work. It&#x2019;s a theory that&#x2019;s been proven and certified. I don&#x2019;t see why I should have to stand here and explain it all to you. That&#x2019;s it. Now please bring Tsumura to me. I&#x2019;ll treat him.&#x201d;<br><br>Osanai straightened his face. He seemed to have remembered that no one could better Atsuko when it came to ironic repartee. &#x201c;No, no. It&#x2019;s not so serious that we need bother you. Hashimoto and I will cure Tsumura. We&#x2019;re his friends, you see.&#x201d;<br><br>Osanai hurried out of the room. Atsuko felt sure that it was he who&#x2019;d spread the rumor about schizophrenia being contagious. But his intention in coming all the way to her lab and circulating it there, when he knew very well that the dangers of the reflector could be avoided, was still unclear to her.<br><br>&#x201c;Curing him alone won&#x2019;t do,&#x201d; Atsuko muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to analyze him properly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He seemed awfully scared that you would easily analyze and cure Tsumura, didn&#x2019;t he,&#x201d; said Nobue.<br><br>2<br><br>Rising from his desk in the Administrator&#x2019;s Office, Torataro Shima invited Atsuko to sit in an armchair in the reception area. He himself sat at one end of a sofa diagonally to her right, where he reclined backward with his body almost supine. The result was that Shima&#x2019;s face became positioned diagonally next to Atsuko&#x2019;s, only a little below hers. Then he merely had to lift his face to find himself gazing at the beauteous visage of Atsuko Chiba from very close quarters. Shima made no secret of his admiration for her.<br><br>&#x201c;So you had a visit from young Osanai, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? You mean he came here too?&#x201d; Atsuko was decidedly unimpressed with Osanai&#x2019;s sense of priorities.<br><br>&#x201c;He said our researchers needn&#x2019;t all subscribe to your theory and help you win the Nobel Prize,&#x201d; Shima said with a chuckle.<br><br>&#x201c;Just as I thought. He came about Tsumura, didn&#x2019;t he. I suppose he yapped on forever with his doubts about the PT devices?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, he opposes them. But who cares? The simple fact is that they&#x2019;ve cured some patients. That&#x2019;s good enough for me.&#x201d; Shima furrowed his brow ever so slightly. &#x201c;In fact, half of the patients have even gone as far as remission. That&#x2019;s something we could never have dreamt of until now, anywhere. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Doctor Chiba? So your theory must be correct, mustn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s mostly down to Tokita &#x2013; he&#x2019;s the one who develops the devices. All I do is use them. Oh, and by the way, about two-thirds of the schizophrenics are already in the remission phase. Not half.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes. I remember. Well, that&#x2019;s wonderful of course . . . &#x201d; Shima pulled a sour face. &#x201c;But why is it that so many patients in the remission phase identify with the head of their institution like that? Some of them mimic me most grotesquely, without a hint of emotion. Just seeing them makes my skin crawl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those are patients in the so-called malleable-vulnerable phase,&#x201d; said Atsuko, laughing with abandon. &#x201c;All they&#x2019;re looking for is transcendental independence. Anyway, doctors and nurses are often mimicked by their patients.&#x201d;<br><br>Momentarily transfixed by Atsuko&#x2019;s laughing demeanor, Shima finally recovered his composure. &#x201c;Osanai didn&#x2019;t say anything unpleasant, did he?&#x201d; he asked somewhat anxiously.</p><h2>Ollie&#39;s Ski Trip: Mini edition</h2><p><p>Six-year-old Ollie is given his first pair of real skis.

Her books spent dozens of weeks on bestseller lists and caught the attention of major media from <i>CBS This Morning</i> to <i>USA Today</i>. Why? Because she opened our eyes to the rich inner lives of animals, showing us that the power of love and friendship is not for humans only.<br><br> In <i>Unlikely Heroes</i>, Ms. Holland uncovers and celebrates yet another side of animals that we often think belongs primarily to people&#x2015;heroism, that indefinable quality of going above and beyond, often for altruistic reasons, often at great personal risk. These 37 inspiring true tales show animals whose quick acts have saved lives, like the pod of dolphins who protected swimmers in New Zealand from a great white shark by forming a screen around them. There are stories of animals who simply and unselfishly give, like Rojo the llama, who shines his very special light of lovingkindness on the elderly patients in an Oregon rehab center. <br><br> And there are compelling stories of heroic resilience: like Naki&#x2019;o, the abandoned puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite but found the grit not only to overcome that terrible hardship but to reclaim the joy of life&#x2015;that&#x2019;s him, smiling on the cover of the book.</p></p><p><p>Jennifer S.

She has also written for, among others, The Discovery Channel, NPR, and <i>The New York Times</i>, specializing in science and natural history.<br><br> &nbsp;</p>Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;In this heartwarming follow-up to Unlikely Friendships: 47 Remarkable Stories from the Animal Kingdom (2011) and Unlikely Loves: 43 Heartwarming True Stories from the Animal Kingdom (2013, both Workman), Holland whips up enthusiasm for the selfless acts of different animals. The book is divided into "Superheroes" (animals engaging in thrilling acts of bravery, such as dolphins who rescue divers from great white sharks), "Everyday Heroes" (creatures still making an impact, including a llama that comforts the elderly and disabled), and "Big-Picture Heroes" (those unknowingly contributing to a larger effort, such as housecats that, through in-vitro fertilization, are gestating and giving birth to endangered black footed kittens). The heroes here run the gamut from wild to tame: rats sniff out landmines, a hippo saves a baby gazelle from a crocodile, a horse rescues his owner from an attacking dog, and more. A charming design enhances the text. Inspirational quotes set the mood for each section, insets throughout add related facts, and eye-catching photographs add to the adorable factor. The upbeat text has a positive tone, but these stories aren't mere fluff. They include plenty of quotes from experts, and Holland casts a critical eye over these tales, being careful not to anthropomorphize; for instance, when writing about the heroism of elephants, she also emphasizes that these large animals can be destructive.

Only later did he discover its ability to destroy any writer's most valuable tools: clarity, consciousness, memory. <br>In <i>A Drinking Life</i>, Hamill explains how alcohol slowly became a part of his life, and how he ultimately left it behind. Along the way, he summons the mood of an America that is gone forever, with the bittersweet fondness of a lifelong New Yorker.<br><br> <b>"Magnificent. <i>A Drinking Life</i> is about growing up and growing old, working and trying to work, within the culture of drink." --<i>Boston Globe</i></b></p><p>Rugged prose and a rare attention to telling detail have long distinguished Pete Hamill&#39;s unique brand of journalism and his universally well received fiction. Twenty years after his last drink, he examines the years he spent as a full-time member of the drinking culture. The result is A Drinking Life, a stirring and exhilarating memoir float is his most personal writing to date. The eldest son of Irish immigrants, Hamill learned from his Brooklyn upbringing during the Depression and World War II that drinking was an essential part of being a man; he only had to accompany his father up the street to the warm, amber-colored world of Gallagher&#39;s bar to see that drinking was what men did. It played a crucial role in mourning the death of relatives or the loss of a job, in celebrations of all kinds, even in religion. In the navy and the world of newspapers, he learned that bonds of friendship, romance, and professional camaraderie were sealed with drink. It was later that he discovered that drink had the power to destroy those very bonds and corrode any writer&#39;s most valuable tools: clarity, consciousness, memory. It was almost too late when he left drinking behind forever. Neither sentimental nor self-righteous, this is a seasoned writer&#39;s vivid portrait of the first four decades of his life and the slow, steady way that alcohol became an essential part of that life. Along the way, he summons the mood of a time and a place gone forever, with the bittersweet fondness of a lifetime New Yorker. It is his best work yet.Pete Hamill is a novelist, journalist, editor, and screenwriter.

Created by the dynamic Janie A. Bowthorpe M.Ed, the patient-to-patient STTM revolution birthed life-changing hypothyroid treatment knowledge and protocols to counter decades of treatment mismanagement due to the use of inferior medications, the wrong lab work, and a poor understanding of symptoms. Now, as Editor, Ms. Bowthorpe brings the reader this acclaimed and brilliant second book, Stop the Thyroid Madness II, authored by over a dozen insightful medical professionals. Each practitioner brings years of excellence and insight into their chapters, not only complimenting what informed thyroid patients have learned, but offering deeper wisdom and knowledge. You&#39;ll read about the functional and holistic approach to thyroid disease, how stress affects the thyroid patient, the superior treatment of natural desiccated thyroid, why the TSH lab test is inadequate, what &#34;normal&#34; really doesn&#39;t mean when it comes to lab work, the importance of nutrition in regaining health and well-being, all about the autoimmune Hashimoto&#39;s version of hypothyroidism, why doctors are the way they are and how to relate to them, gluten and nutritional issues, thyroid toxicity and how to counter those toxins, the Reverse T3 problem, how MTHFR and methylation blockages can affect thyroid patients, and an understanding of why so many thyroid patients end up with low cortisol, aka hypocortisolism.</p><p></p><h2>A Letter of Mary: A Novel of Suspense Featuring Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes (A Mary Russell Mystery, 3)</h2><p><p>The third book in the Mary Russell&#x2013;Sherlock Holmes series.</p><p>It is 1923. Mary Russell Holmes and her husband, the retired Sherlock Holmes, are enjoying the summer together on their Sussex estate when they are visited by an old friend, Miss Dorothy Ruskin, an archaeologist just returned from Palestine. She leaves in their protection an ancient manuscript which seems to hint at the possibility that Mary Magdalene was an apostle&#x2015;an artifact certain to stir up a storm of biblical proportions in the Christian establishment. When Ruskin is suddenly killed in a tragic accident, Russell and Holmes find themselves on the trail of a fiendishly clever murderer. <i>A Letter of Mary </i>by Laurie R. King is brimming with political intrigue, theological arcana, and brilliant Holmesian deductions.</p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and his scholarly companion Mary Russell are caught up in an exciting mystery when an archaeologist leaves them with a treasured find, a papyrus supposedly written by Mary Magdalene. When the archaeoligist winds up dead and someone attempts to make off with the artifact, Holmes and Russel become embroiled in a rollicking story filled with political intrigue and highbrow sleuthing.

Twenty minutes after midnight, fourteen miles south of Rancho Mirage in the otherwise impenetrable darkness of the Anza-Borrego Desert, Jack and Krista were lit in the harsh purple glare of the lights that blossomed from Danny Trehorn&#x2019;s truck, Jack so much in love with this girl his heart beat with hers.</p><p>Trehorn gunned his engine.</p><p>&#x201c;You guys comin&#x2019; or what?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista snuggled deeper into Jack&#x2019;s arms.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stay a little longer. Just us. Not them. I want to tell you something.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack called to his friend.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma�ana, dude. We&#x2019;re gonna hang.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We roll early, bro. See you at nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See us at noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pussy! We&#x2019;ll wake your ass up!&#x201d;</p><p>Trehorn dropped back into his truck, and spun a one-eighty back toward town, <i>Ride of the Valkyries</i> blaring on his sound system. Chuck Lautner and Deli Blake tucked Chuck&#x2019;s ancient Land Cruiser in tight behind Trehorn, their headlamps flashing over Jack&#x2019;s Mustang, which was parked up the old county road where the ground was more even. They had come out to show Krista a drug smuggler&#x2019;s airplane that had crashed in 1972 because Krista wanted to see it.</p><p>Jack grew colder as their tail lights receded, and the desert grew darker. A thin crescent moon and cloudy star field gave them enough light to see, but little more.</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;Dark.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;Cold.&#x201d;</p><p>He snuggled closer, spooning into her back, both of them staring at nothing. Jack wondered what she was seeing.</p><p>Krista had been pensive all night even though she had pushed them to come, and now her wanting to tell him something felt ominous. Jack had the sick feeling she was pregnant or dumping him. Krista was two months from graduating <i>summa cum laude</i> at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, and had taken a job in D.C. Jack had dropped out of USC.</p><p>Jack nuzzled into her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we okay?&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed away far enough to study him, then smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;There have never been two people better than us. I am totally in love with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You had me worried.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for getting Danny to bring us out here. I don&#x2019;t think he wanted to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long drive if you&#x2019;ve seen it a million times. He stopped coming out here in high school.&#x201d;</p><p>According to Trehorn, the twin-engine Cessna 310 had crashed while bringing in a load of coke at night during a sandstorm. A local drug dealer named Greek Cisneros cleared enough cactus and rocks to fashion a landing strip in the middle of the desert twenty miles outside Palm Springs, and used the airplane to bring cocaine and marijuana up from Mexico, almost always at night when the outline of the runway was marked by burning tubs of gasoline. On the night of the crash, the right wingtip hooked into the ground, the landing gear collapsed, and the left wing snapped off outside the left engine. Fuel pouring from the ruptured fuel tanks ignited, enveloping the airplane in flames. The engines and instruments had long ago been salvaged for parts, but the broken airframe remained where it died, rusting, corroded, and covered with generations of overlapping graffiti and spray-painted initials: LJ+DF, eat me, PSHS#1.</p><p>Krista took his hand, and tugged him toward the plane.</p><p>&#x201c;Come with me. I want to show you something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you tell me about it in the car? I&#x2019;m cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not in the car. This is important.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack followed her along the fuselage to the tail, wondering what she wanted to show him about this stupid airplane, but instead she led him onto the overgrown remains of the runway. She stared into the darkness that masked the desert. Her smart, black eyes shined like jewels filled with starlight. Jack touched her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Kris?&#x201d;</p><p>They had known each other for one year, two months, and sixteen days. They had been head-over-heels, crazy, there-and-back, inside-out, bottom-to-top in love for five months, three weeks, and eleven days. He hadn&#x2019;t told her the truth about himself until after she declared her love. If he had secrets then, she had secrets now.</p><p>Krista took his hand in both of hers, giving him the serious, all-business eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;This place is special to my family.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p>&#x201c;A drug runner&#x2019;s airstrip?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This place, right here between the mountains, it&#x2019;s a place easily found by people coming from the south, for all the same reasons the drug dealers put their landing strip here. When my mother was seven, coyotes brought her up through the desert from the south. Mom and her sister and two cousins. A man with a hearse was waiting here at this airplane to drive them into town.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;No shit?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista laughed, but her laugh was unsure.</p><p>&#x201c;I never knew. She only told me a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey. I&#x2019;m giving you momentous family history, and you don&#x2019;t care?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean that she&#x2019;s illegal&#x2014;undocumented. Who gives a shit?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista tipped back to look up at him, then suddenly grabbed his ears and kissed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Undocumented, but you don&#x2019;t have to go all PC.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista&#x2019;s mother had described a twelve-day trip on foot, in cars, and in a delivery truck where it got so hot that an old man died. The last leg of their journey had been in a covered pickup truck at night past the Salton Sea and across a sixteen-mile stretch of desert to the old crash site. The man with the hearse had driven them to a supermarket parking lot at the eastern edge of Coachella, where her uncle was waiting.</p><p>She looked south into the darkness as if she could see her mother&#x2019;s footsteps.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if she hadn&#x2019;t come through this place. She wouldn&#x2019;t have met my dad. I wouldn&#x2019;t have met you. I wouldn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista looked up, and her face was all <i>summa-cum-laude</i> focused.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you imagine what her journey must have been like? I&#x2019;m her kid, and I can&#x2019;t even begin.&#x201d;</p><p>She was starting to say more when Jack heard a far-off squeal. He stood taller, listening, but didn&#x2019;t say anything until he heard it again.</p><p>&#x201c;You hear it?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista turned as the faint sound of a muffled engine reached them, and two lurching shapes appeared in the dim starlight. Jack studied them for a moment, and realized they were lightless trucks crawling toward them across the desert. Jack felt a stab of fear, and whispered frantically into her ear.</p><p>&#x201c;This sucks, man. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, no&#x2014;I want to see. Shh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They could be drug runners. We don&#x2019;t want to be here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just wait!&#x201d;</p><p>She pulled him to the far side of the airplane, where they settled into a low depression between the cactus.</p><p>A large box truck emerged from the dark like a ship appearing out of a fog. It rumbled onto the overgrown landing strip, and stopped less than thirty yards away. No brake lights flared when it stopped. Jack tried to make himself even smaller, and wished he had pulled Kris away.</p><p>A moment later, the cab creaked open, and two men climbed out. The driver walked a few yards in front of the truck, then studied a glowing handheld device. This deep in the desert, Jack thought it was probably a GPS.</p><p>While the driver studied his GPS, the passenger went to the back of the truck, and pushed the box door open with a loud clatter. The man said something in Spanish, then Jack heard soft voices as silhouette people climbed from the truck.</p><p>Jack whispered, &#x201c;What are they doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh. This is amazing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They gotta be illegals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista shifted position, and Jack cringed with a fresh burst of fear. She was taking pictures with her cell phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop. They&#x2019;ll see us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one can see.&#x201d;</p><p>The people emerging stayed near the truck as if they were confused. So many people appeared Jack did not see how they had all fit inside. As many as thirty people stood uneasily in the brush, speaking in low murmurs with alien accents that Jack strained to identify.</p><p>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t Spanish. What are they speaking, Chinese?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista lowered her phone and strained to listen, too.</p><p>&#x201c;A few Spanish speakers, but most of them sound Asian. Something else, too. Is that Arabic?&#x201d;</p><p>The man who opened the truck returned to the driver, and spoke clearly in Spanish. Jack figured these two were the coyotes&#x2014;guides who were hired to sneak people illegally into the U.S. He leaned closer to Krista, who was fluent in Spanish.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Where in hell are they? Those bastards are supposed to be here.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The driver mumbled something neither Jack nor Krista understood, then visibly jumped when three sets of headlights topped by roll-bar lamps snapped on a hundred yards behind the box truck, lighting the desert between in stark relief. Three off-road trucks roared forward, bouncing high on their oversized tires. The two coyotes shouted, and a scrambled chatter rose from the milling people. The driver ran into the desert, and his partner ran back to their truck. He emerged with a shotgun, and ran after his friend even as two of the incoming pickups skidded in a loose circle around the box truck, kicking up murky clouds of dust. The third chased after the fleeing men, and gunfire flashed in the dark. The crowd broke in every direction, some crying, some screaming, some scrambling back into the box truck as if they could hide.</p><p>Jack pulled Krista backward, then jumped up and ran.</p><p>&#x201c;Run! C&#x2019;mon, run!&#x201d;</p><p>He ran hard toward his Mustang, then realized Krista wasn&#x2019;t with him. Men with clubs and shotguns jumped from the pickups to chase down fleeing people. Krista was still between the cactus, taking pictures.</p><p>Jack started to shout for her, but stopped himself, not wanting to draw attention. He and Krista were outside the light, and hidden by darkness. He risked a sharp hiss instead.</p><p>&#x201c;Kris&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head, telling him she was fine, and resumed taking pictures. Jack ran back to her, and grabbed her arm. Hard.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s <i>go</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right. Okay&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>They started to rise as four Asian women came around the plane&#x2019;s tail and ran past less than ten yards away.</p><p>A man with a shotgun came around the tail after them, shouting in Spanish, and Jack wondered if these poor women could even understand what he said. Then the man stopped, and stood absolutely still as if he were a cardboard cutout against the night sky.</p><p>Jack held his breath, and prayed. He wondered why the man was standing so still, then saw the man was wearing night-vision goggles.</p><p>The man was looking at them.</p><p>There in the starlit desert landscape where no one could hear the shots, the man lifted his shotgun, and aimed at Jack Berman.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>six days after they were taken</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When people call a private investigator because someone they love is missing, especially a child, the fear bubbles in their voice like boiling lard. When Nita Morales called that morning about her missing adult daughter, she didn&#x2019;t sound afraid. She was irritated. Ms. Morales phoned because the Sunday <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine </i>published a story about me eight weeks ago, rehashing a case where I cleared an innocent man who had been convicted of multiple homicides. The magazine people came to my office, took a couple of pretty good pictures, and made me sound like a cross between Philip Marlowe and Batman. If I were Nita Morales, I would have called me, too.</p><p>Her business, Hector Sports &amp; Promotions, was on the east side of the Los Angeles River near the Sixth Street Bridge, not far from where giant radioactive ants boiled up from the sewer to be roasted by James Arness in the 1954 classic, <i>Them!</i> It was a warehouse area now, but no less dangerous. Buildings were layered with gang tags and graffiti, and signs warned employees to lock their cars. Steel bars covered windows and concertina wire lined roofs, but not to keep out the ants.</p><p>That spring morning, 8:55 A.M., a low haze filled the sky with a glare so bright I squinted behind the Wayfarers as I found the address. Hector Sports&nbsp;&amp; Promotions was in a newer building with a gated, ten-foot chain-link fence enclosing their parking lot.</p><p>A young Latin guy with thick shoulders and dull eyes came out when I stopped, as if he had been waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;You the magazine guy?&#x201d;</p><p>The magazine guy.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Elvis Cole. I have a ten o&#x2019;clock with Ms. Morales.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I gotta unlock the gate. See the empty spot where it says <i>Delivery</i>? Park there. You might want to put up the top and lock it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Think it&#x2019;ll be safe?&#x201d;</p><p>That would be me, flashing the ironic smile at their overkill battlestar security.</p><p>&#x201c;For sure. They only steal clean cars.&#x201d;</p><p>That would be him, putting me in my place.</p><p>He shook his head sadly as I drove past.</p><p>&#x201c;I had an old Vette like this, I&#x2019;d show some love. I&#x2019;d pop those dents, for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>That would be him, rubbing it in. My Jamaica yellow 1966 Corvette Stingray convertible is a classic. It&#x2019;s also dirty.</p><p>He locked the parking gate behind us, told me he was Nita Morales&#x2019;s assistant, and led me inside. We passed through an outer office with a counter for customers, and a man and woman at separate desks. The man and woman both looked over, and the man held up the Sunday magazine issue with my story. Embarrassing.</p><p>We passed through a door onto the shop floor where fifteen or twenty people were operating machines that sewed logos on baseball caps and photo-inked mugs. Nita Morales had a glass office on the far side of the shop where she could see the floor and everything happening there. She saw us coming, and stepped from behind her desk to greet the magazine guy when we entered. Tight smile. Dry hand. All business.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mr. Cole, I&#x2019;m Nita.

It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P.

Now, a quarter century after <em>The Joke</em> was first published and several years after the collapse of the Soviet-imposed Czechoslovak regime, it becomes easier to put such implications into perspective in favor of valuing the book (and all Kundera 's work) as what it truly is: great, stirring literature that sheds new light on the eternal themes of human existence.</p><p>The present edition provides English-language readers an important further means toward revaluation of <em>The Joke</em>. For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators.

This chamber includes holographic technology with a visual data bank of infinite DNA permutations in addition to three tunnels: one leading to the inner earth, one to Tibet and one to Egypt. After being allowed to explore some of these artefacts, Radu was befriended by an enigmatic alchemist named Elinor who introduced him to an equally mysterious Tibetan Lama. This book begins with Radu becoming the guardian of Elinor&#39;s exotic villa in Bucharest which contains a remarkable alchemical laboratory in the basement.Radu is soon thereafter recruited for Department Zero, Romania&#39;s most secret intelligence unit, by his old friend, Cezar Brad, and becomes part of an expedition to explore a mysterious tunnel which leads from the chamber beneath the Romanian Sphinx to a different type of chamber beneath the Giza Plateau which contains ancient artefacts that look more futuristic than they do ancient, one of them being a bioresonant device through which one can visit past and future events. This amazing expedition includes an American from the Pentagon with a top secret laptop computer he is intuitively connected to that not only displays intricate holograms but is also linked to Hilbert (inter-dimensional) Space. Ancient archeology meets future science in this true life adventure that penetrates the secrets of Egypt in a way that has not been previously conceived of in our society.</p><p>ANCIENT ARCHEOLOGY MEETS FUTURE SCIENCE Scientists have traditionally viewed themselves as advanced beings while those who came before are viewed as primitive, but new evidence across the globe is discovering the opposite. Nowhere has this been demonstrated more than in the discovery of ancient chambers beneath the Romanian Sphinx in the Bucegi Mountains and the Giza Plateau in Egypt where ancient technology has been found that is more modern than ancient. True science must not only refuse to be in denial of the obvious, it must reconcile itself with the fact that scientists live in an environment of censorship and secrecy. This bottleneck of secrecy is explained by Radu Cinamar who participated in a joint collaboration of secret Romanian and American forces in an unprecedented exploration of ancient artifacts beneath Giza that sets the new paradigm for the culture of Earth. In the background, Radu&#39;s team sets the stage for Peter Moon to meet Elinor, the mysterious alchemist whose ancestors have lived for hundreds of years by pursuing a secret tradition of the Great Work which prolongs life indefinitely until one can evolve beyond the physical plane.Radu Cinamar is a Romanian author and a very mysterious figure who was chosen by the head of Department Zero, the most secretive department of the Romanian government&#39;s intelligence network to write about what was found from the secret excavations beneath the Romanian Sphinx in 2003. He was subsequently recruited to work for Department Zero and has worked there for several years. Radu has four books about his various experiences.</p><h2>Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in His Own Time</h2><p><p>In <i>Paul Among the People</i>, Sarah Ruden explores the writings of the evangelist Paul in the context of his time and culture, to recover his original message of freedom and love while overturning the common&#x2014;and fundamental&#x2014;misconception that Paul represented a puritanical, hysterically homophobic, misogynist, or reactionary vision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>By setting famous and controversial words of Paul against ancient Greek and Roman literature, Ruden reveals a radical message of human freedom and dignity at the heart of Paul&#x2019;s preaching. Her training in the Classics allows her to capture the stark contrast between Paul&#x2019;s Christianity and the violence, exploitation, and dehumanization permeating the Roman Empire in his era. In contrast to later distortions, the vision of Christian life Ruden finds in Paul is centered on equality before God and the need for people to love one another. <br>&nbsp;<br>A remarkable work of scholarship, synthesis, and understanding, <i>Paul Among the People </i>recaptures the moral urgency and revolutionary spirit that made Christianity such a shock to the ancient world and laid the foundation of the culture in which we live today.</p></p><p><p><b>Sarah Ruden</b> was educated at the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, and Harvard. She has translated four books of classical literature, among them <i>The Aeneid</i> and is the author of <i>Other Places</i> a book of poetry. She is a visiting scholar at Wesleyan University and lives with her husband in Middleton, Conn.<br></p><b>Chapter 1: Paul and Aristophanes&#x2014; No, Really </b><br>&nbsp;<br>The last thing I expected my Greek and Latin to be of any use for was a better understanding of Paul. The very idea, had anyone proposed it, would have annoyed me. I am a Christian, but like many, I kept Paul in a pen out back with the louder and more sexist Old Testament prophets. Jesus was my teacher; Paul was an embarrassment. <br>&nbsp;<br>But one day, in a Bible study class I was taking, a young woman objected to the stricture against sorcery in the &#x201c;fruit of the Spirit&#x201d; passage in Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Galatians. She said that to her sorcery meant &#x201c;just the ability to project my power and essence.&#x201d; Most of the class gave the familiar sigh: Paul <i>was </i>kind of a brute, wasn&#x2019;t he? I would have sighed too, had there not flashed into my mind an example of what sor�cery could mean in a Greco-Roman context: the Roman poet Horace&#x2019;s image of a small boy buried up to his neck and left to starve to death while staring at food, so that his liver and bone marrow, which must now be imbued with his frenzied longing, could serve as a love charm. Paul, I reflected, may never have read this poem (which depicts a crime that may never have happened), but it shows the kind of reputation sorcery had in the Roman Empire&#x2014;certainly among people with a polytheistic background, who made up the main read�ership for his letters both during his lifetime and after it. I could not get away from the thought that what his writings would have meant for them is probably as close as we can come to their basic original importance, as key documents (prior even to the gospels) inspiring the world-changing new movement, Christianity. <br>&nbsp;<br>As I began to read Paul in connection to Greco-Roman writing, I seemed to be actually reading him: understanding his devotion and his constraints, and not simply listening to 1 Corinthians 13 with boredom and irritation, and with smug agreement to excoriations of his &#x201c;betrayal of Jesus&#x2019; message.&#x201d; I came to see how a man whom a divinity student friend of mine called &#x201c;grumpy-pants Paul&#x201d; had spread an uncompromising message of love, and how he had estab�lished a community that proved to have, if not a steady power for good, then at least a steady power for renewing its ideals. More and more, I wanted to take his part. <br>&nbsp;<br>This feeling grew even stronger when I researched the ori�gins of our bad impressions of Paul. It seemed that many reactions to him across the centuries had been distorted or incomplete in ways that would not have survived a look at his main contemporary and near-contemporary audiences through their own books. For every implausible reading of Paul, there were Greco-Roman works through the lens of which he showed more plausibly. The contrast between dis�tant views of Paul in a variety of modern authors and the very near view that we can re-create came to seem like a way to organize a book. <br>&nbsp;<br>Others have written defenses of Paul, but he needs&#x2014;and deserves&#x2014;all the help he can get. His faults are obvious enough: his bad temper, his self-righteousness, his anxiety. But we tend not to feel inspired that such a painfully human personality was able to achieve so much in the name of God. And we do not ask the obvious question, which is, what was he doing right in substance that is hidden from us under his manner? He must have been doing a great deal right or he could not have succeeded as he did. <br>&nbsp;<br>And understanding his success is vital for letting him help us now. Paul dealt with several social issues that remain painful today. Read in a way that shows the challenges, ideals, and strategies behind his words, he usually offers diverse people something they can agree on. In the case of homosexuality, it is the passion he had for ending exploita�tive sex, the only physical expression of homoeroticism he likely knew about. Getting closer to Paul as he really was can allow Christians and non-Christians either to find common ground to build on or to part ways more peacefully, because they see that they merely disagree on how to reach the same goals and can no longer call each other&#x2019;s intentions evil. <br>&nbsp;<br>Paul is, of course, not easy to understand. Probably many Greeks and Romans themselves misunderstood him or skimmed the surface of his arguments when he used terms such as &#x201c;law&#x201d; (referring to the Jewish religious law in which he himself was trained). But their literature is still a good basis for interpretation: they shared a language with him, Greek, and a cosmopolitan urban culture, that of the Roman Empire, and he considered evangelizing them his special mission. <br>&nbsp;<br>What Greco-Roman works can teach about Paul&#x2019;s writ�ings is incredibly rich and virtually unexplored so far&#x2014;and often rather mortifying to a previous knee-jerk anti-Paulist like me. For example, there is the matter of the <i>komos </i>and the right to have a really good party. The &#x201c;fruit of the Spirit&#x201d; pas�sage in Galatians does not forbid &#x201c;carousing,&#x201d; the outrageous New Revised Standard Version translation of the word, or &#x201c;revellings,&#x201d; as in the King James. A <i>k&#x14d;mos </i>was a late-night, very drunken, sometimes violent postparty parade&#x2014;which could even end in kidnapping and rape. We have vivid scenes of it in Greek comedy and other genres. It was nearly the worst of Greek nightlife, and if any Christian young men counted on still being allowed to behave like rampaging frat boys or overgrown trick-or-treaters in a foul mood, their eld�ers would have been relieved to have it in writing from Paul that this was banned. Other translations, probably in an effort to be less dour, have &#x201c;orgies,&#x201d; but that is unsatisfactory: some features of Greek parties <i>were </i>orgylike, but not the <i>k&#x14d;mos. </i>And since orgies are quite rare today (I think), a reader might wonder why Paul included something so unusual in his list, as if a modern pastor were to speak against flashing. We would never guess from the English that the abuse Paul is speaking of is <i>both </i>serious and customary. <br>&nbsp;<br>I was at first puzzled that nobody had lined up Paul&#x2019;s let�ters and Greco-Roman literature in any systematic way before, but I soon realized that scholarly disciplines are not set up for it. In seven years at Harvard as a classics graduate student, I got to know exactly two divinity students, and only as friends, not as scholars. I never met any of the divinity professors, wherever they were, somewhere up in the cloudy regions of the North Yard. Their language courses were separate, and in my curriculum there was not a single piece of Christian literature out of all that belonged to the era I was studying. We behaved as if the New Testament had not been written in Greek, as if Paul had not been a Hellenized Jew and by some accounts a Roman citizen, and as if the Roman Empire at its greatest period of power had not been in the early Christians&#x2019; background. <br>&nbsp;<br>I was now stunned at how much perspective this took away from Christianity. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, we&#x2019;re not supposed to have orgies, no kidding.&#x201d; Maybe shallowness of perspective is one reason so many people consider the religion pass�&#x2014;not interesting, not inspiring, not useful. To me, even the first efforts at setting Paul&#x2019;s words against the words of polytheis�tic authors helped explain why early Christianity was so com�pelling, growing as no popular movement ever had before. And as I went on, I found that&#x2014;almost creepily&#x2014;the pas�sages to which the modern world has the most resistance were all telling me the same thing: contemporary readers would likely not have seen Paul&#x2019;s &#x201c;authoritarian&#x201d; policies as anything but ways to connect with one another in conscien�tious tenderness. <br>&nbsp;<br>In this way, I was dragged away from a quite dear preju�dice: that the socially concerned church was an invention of the modern era. (We Quakers have always thought our own sect invented it, but I won&#x2019;t go into that.) In fact, the compassionate community was there at the beginning, and its founder was Paul of Tarsus. To those asking, &#x201c;But how do we live, right here, right now?&#x201d; his answer was always in essence the same: &#x201c;In a way worthy of God&#x2019;s infinite love for each of you.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>This is his story as told not only by himself, but by Aristophanes, Herodas, Petronius, Juvenal, Apuleius, and many others he never met. It is the story of his challenges and his triumphs in their world. And here&#x2019;s a little of what it tells us for today. <br><br><b>Chapter 2: The End of Fun? Paul and Pleasure </b><br>&nbsp;<br>What was Paul&#x2019;s real message about the body and social life? Don&#x2019;t ask the Puritans. When these gained power and sought to wipe out the enjoyments (games, drama, feasting, dancing, fancy hats) that the medieval church had spared, the main New Testament authority they alleged was Paul. Richard Baxter (1615&#x2013;91) of Kidderminster, in England, cites him over and over in part VII of his <i>Directions to Weak Christians, </i>&#x201c;Directions Against the Master Sin; Sensuality, Flesh-Pleasing, or Voluptuousness.&#x201d; By this time, &#x201c;flesh&#x201d; meant roughly anything that is often done for its own sake, like eat�ing or conversation, and Baxter condemned what we would today call the most ordinary and natural pleasures: <br>&nbsp;<br>Do you think that man is made for no higher matters than a beast? and that you have not a more noble object for your delight than your swine or dog hath, who have the pleasure of meat, and lust, and play, and ease, and fancy, as well as you? Certainly where sensual pleasures are preferred before the higher pleasures of the soul, that man becomes a beast, or worse, subjecting his rea�son to his brutish part. <br>&nbsp;<br>The looming trouble with pleasure of all kinds was that it could come between you and your religion. (&#x201c;Flesh-pleasing is the grand idolatry of the world, and the flesh the greatest idol that ever was set up against God.&#x201d;) That is, if you found you liked doing anything more than you liked praying, exhorting, and reading pious books, you were in for it. So pretty much everyone was in for it, or had hope only in sus�pecting and resisting any natural draw. <br><br>[Flesh-pleasing] is the very rebellion of corrupted nature; the turning of all things upside-down; the taking down God, and heaven, and reason, and destroy�ing the use of all the creatures, and setting up flesh-pleasing instead of all, and making a brute of your god and governor. And do you ask what harm there is in this? So will your child do, when he desireth any play, or pleasure; and the sick, when they desire to please their appetite. <br>&nbsp;<br>Many people think Paul is the original authority for this (and for all puritanism; the Puritans only epitomized the ide�ology), because of what he wrote about the flesh. One of the passages Baxter and other Puritans relied on most is the &#x201c;fruit of the Spirit&#x201d; part of Galatians 5. (I count five citations of that passage within &#x201c;Directions Against the Master Sin,&#x201d; more than of any other part of the Bible.) At the heart of Paul&#x2019;s exhortation is a pair of lists: what not to do to indulge the flesh, and what the fruit of the Spirit will be. <br>&nbsp;<br>Paul&#x2019;s letters contain other lists of bad things and good things, but here the strictures have a special force. Galatians is mainly about false teachings and alienating practices, and the criteria for spiritual fruit answer the vital question of how a group of believers can <i>tell </i>whether they are going in the right way&#x2014;that is, whether the Spirit is really working in them. So it is hardly an academic matter to get a better sense of the spe�cific acts and attitudes Paul condemns and commends. Here, in the original King James translation of Galatians 5, some close derivative of which Baxter would have used, are the bad things: <br>&nbsp;<br><b>19 </b>Nowe the workes of the flesh are manifest, which are <i>these, </i>adulterie, fornication, vncleanness, lasciuiousnesse, 20 Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emula�tions, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21 Enuyings, murthers, drunkennesse, reuellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I haue also tolde you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherite the kingdome of God. <br>&nbsp;<br>I will go straight back over Baxter&#x2019;s head with my ques�tions. Would people of Paul&#x2019;s time have read him as preach�ing against natural desires and ordinary fun? What exactly did these words mean about the way people were expected to live according to this new religion? <br>&nbsp;<br>Picture the Galatians hearing this list read for the first time, perhaps in the house of the most well-to-do member of their church, where they usually meet to pray and eat together. They know Paul as a poor speaker and a scrawny, sickly man of the unpopular Jewish race. He may have been kind to them in person, but now they have his bad temper emerging from the papyrus of his long letter to them. He thinks his rivals should go castrate themselves (5:12), and he snarls that he is writing in big letters for the Galatian Christians (6:11)&#x2014;not that he needs to rub in his scorn: he has already called them &#x201c;foolish&#x201d; (a soft-pedaling translation: more precise would be &#x201c;brainless&#x201d;). What use might words like those in the list above have been to this church? The cor�rect answer is not &#x201c;They were another reason to throw the letter away and go back to the shrine of Isis.&#x201d; If we judge Paul&#x2019;s prose that harshly, we would have to wonder why any of his letters, not to say his churches, survived. <br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, I&#x2019;ll answer my own question. All of Galatians 5 shows a great concern with the link between religion and getting along with other people, caring for them, allowing communities to thrive. Among those who had grown up as polytheists, there was nothing trite about this program. On the contrary, it set out a new way of thinking that must have been quite exciting, a hope for something beyond exploita�tion, materialism, and violence&#x2014;a plan not for competing in purity and the denial of life, but for the sharing of life in full. The words in the list above, even the words we might at first associate with puritanical values, back this up. <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;ADULTERY&#x201d;</b> <b>IS THE </b>only way to translate the word <i>moicheia, </i>but here translation just doesn&#x2019;t communicate; it merely leaves us crouching over two thousand years of mostly inapplicable experience, including puritanism and our reac�tions against it. For us, the thought of religion banning adultery might bring up images of Hester Prynne standing on the scaffold in public, displaying her scarlet letter <i>A </i>and being harangued by her lover, the minister. <br>&nbsp;<br>For Greeks, &#x201c;adultery&#x201d; was far different. A <i>moichos </i>(the root word) was a man (married or not) having sex with another man&#x2019;s wife, and rage and punishment were aimed at him, not her. We don&#x2019;t know precisely how all of the various Greek and Greek-influenced city-states treated this kind of adultery (though we are certain that it was the only kind that was illegal), but we do know well the system set up in fifth-century b.c. Athens. In Athens, adultery with a married woman, once known, automatically broke up her household, and the main victims were the children, who would now be classed as illegitimate. They could not inherit (a vital privilege, as I will show below) and were no longer citizens. Neither boys nor girls would be a...</p><h2>The Buddha in the Attic</h2><p><p><b>Julie Otsuka's <i>The Buddha in the Attic</i>, the follow-up to <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> was shortlisted for the 2011 National Book Award for Fiction and the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and winner of the Pen Faulkner Award for Fiction 2012.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Between the first and second world wars a group of young, non-English-speaking Japanese women travelled by boat to America.

We had long black hair and flat wide feet and we were not very tall. Some of us had eaten nothing but rice gruel as young girls and had slightly bowed legs, and some of us were only fourteen years old and were still young girls ourselves. Some of us came from the city, and wore stylish city clothes, but many more of us came from the country and on the boat we wore the same old kimonos we'd been wearing for years-faded hand-me-downs from our sisters that had been patched and redyed many times. Some of us came from the mountains, and had never before seen the sea, except for in pictures, and some of us were the daughters of fishermen who had been around the sea all our lives. Perhaps we had lost a brother or father to the sea, or a fianc�, or perhaps someone we loved had jumped into the water one unhappy morning and simply swum away, and now it was time for us, too, to move on.<br><br>On the boat the first thing we did-before deciding who we liked and didn't like, before telling each other which one of the islands we were from, and why we were leaving, before even bothering to learn each other's names-was compare photographs of our husbands. They were handsome young men with dark eyes and full heads of hair and skin that was smooth and unblemished. Their chins were strong. Their posture, good. Their noses were straight and high. They looked like our brothers and fathers back home, only better dressed, in gray frock coats and fine Western three-piece suits. Some of them were standing on sidewalks in front of wooden A-frame houses with white picket fences and neatly mowed lawns, and some were leaning in driveways against Model T Fords. Some were sitting in studios on stiff high- backed chairs with their hands neatly folded and staring straight into the camera, as though they were ready to take on the world. All of them had promised to be there, waiting for us, in San Francisco, when we sailed into port.<br><br>On the boat, we often wondered: Would we like them? Would we love them? Would we recognize them from their pictures when we first saw them on the dock?<br><br>On the boat we slept down below, in steerage, where it was filthy and dim. Our beds were narrow metal racks stacked one on top of the other and our mattresses were hard and thin and darkened with the stains of other journeys, other lives. Our pillows were stuffed with dried wheat hulls. Scraps of food littered the passageways between berths and the floors were wet and slick. There was one porthole, and in the evening, after the hatch was closed, the darkness filled with whispers. Will it hurt? Bodies tossed and turned beneath the blankets. The sea rose and fell. The damp air stifled. At night we dreamed of our husbands. We dreamed of new wooden sandals and endless bolts of indigo silk and of living, one day, in a house with a chimney. We dreamed we were lovely and tall. We dreamed we were back in the rice paddies, which we had so desperately wanted to escape. The rice paddy dreams were always nightmares. We dreamed of our older and prettier sisters who had been sold to the geisha houses by our fathers so that the rest of us might eat, and when we woke we were gasping for air. For a second I thought I was her.<br><br>Our first few days on the boat we were seasick, and could not keep down our food, and had to make repeated trips to the railing. Some of us were so dizzy we could not even walk, and lay in our berths in a dull stupor, unable to remember our own names, not to mention those of our new husbands. Remind me one more time, I'm Mrs. Who? Some of us clutched our stomachs and prayed out loud to Kannon, the goddess of mercy-Where are you?-while others of us preferred to turn silently green. And often, in the middle of the night, we were jolted awake by a violent swell and for a brief moment we had no idea where we were, or why our beds would not stop moving, or why our hearts were pounding with such dread. Earthquake was the first thought that usually came to our minds. We reached out for our mothers then, in whose arms we had slept until the morning we left home. Were they sleeping now? Were they dreaming? Were they thinking of us night and day? Were they still walking three steps behind our fathers on the streets with their arms full of packages while our fathers carried nothing at all? Were they secretly envious of us for sailing away? Didn't I give you everything? Had they remembered to air out our old kimonos? Had they remembered to feed the cats? Had they made sure to tell us everything we needed to know? Hold your teacup with both hands, stay out of the sun, never say more than you have to.<br><br>Most of us on the boat were accomplished, and were sure we would make good wives. We knew how to cook and sew. We knew how to serve tea and arrange flowers and sit quietly on our flat wide feet for hours, saying absolutely nothing of substance at all. A girl must blend into a room: she must be present without appearing to exist. We knew how to behave at funerals, and how to write short, melancholy poems about the passing of autumn that were exactly seventeen syllables long. We knew how to pull weeds and chop kindling and haul water, and one of us-the rice miller's daughter-knew how to walk two miles into town with an eighty-pound sack of rice on her back without once breaking into a sweat. It's all in the way you breathe. Most of us had good manners, and were extremely polite, except for when we got mad and cursed like sailors. Most of us spoke like ladies most of the time, with our voices pitched high, and pretended to know much less than we did, and whenever we walked past the deckhands we made sure to take small, mincing steps with our toes turned properly in. Because how many times had our mothers told us: Walk like the city, not like the farm!<br><br>On the boat we crowded into each other's bunks every night and stayed up for hours discussing the unknown continent ahead of us. The people there were said to eat nothing but meat and their bodies were covered with hair (we were mostly Buddhist, and did not eat meat, and only had hair in the appropriate places). The trees were enormous. The plains were vast. The women were loud and tall-a full head taller, we had heard, than the tallest of our men. The language was ten times as difficult as our own and the customs were unfathomably strange. Books were read from back to front and soap was used in the bath. Noses were blown on dirty cloths that were stuffed back into pockets only to be taken out later and used again and again. The opposite of white was not red, but black. What would become of us, we wondered, in such an alien land? We imagined ourselves-an unusually small people armed only with our guidebooks-entering a country of giants. Would we be laughed at? Spat on? Or, worse yet, would we not be taken seriously at all? But even the most reluctant of us had to admit that it was better to marry a stranger in America than grow old with a farmer from the village. Because in America the women did not have to work in the fields and there was plenty of rice and firewood for all. And wherever you went the men held open the doors and tipped their hats and called out, "Ladies first" and "After you."<br><br>Some of us on the boat were from Kyoto, and were delicate and fair, and had lived our entire lives in darkened rooms at the back of the house. Some of us were from Nara, and prayed to our ancestors three times a day, and swore we could still hear the temple bells ringing. Some of us were farmers' daughters from Yamaguchi with thick wrists and broad shoulders who had never gone to bed after nine. Some of us were from a small mountain hamlet in Yamanashi and had only recently seen our first train. Some of us were from Tokyo, and had seen everything, and spoke beautiful Japanese, and did not mix much with any of the others. Many more of us were from Kagoshima and spoke in a thick southern dialect that those of us from Tokyo pretended we could not understand. Some of us were from Hokkaido, where it was snowy and cold, and would dream of that white landscape for years. Some of us were from Hiroshima, which would later explode, and were lucky to be on the boat at all though of course we did not then know it. The youngest of us was twelve, and from the eastern shore of Lake Biwa, and had not yet begun to bleed. My parents married me off for the betrothal money. The oldest of us was thirty-seven, and from Niigata, and had spent her entire life taking care of her invalid father, whose recent death made her both happy and sad. I knew I could only marry if he died. One of us was from Kumamoto, where there were no more eligible men-all of the eligible men had left the year before to find work in Manchuria-and felt fortunate to have found any kind of husband at all. I took one look at his photograph and told the matchmaker, "He'll do." One of us was from a silk-weaving village in Fukushima, and had lost her first husband to the flu, and her second to a younger and prettier woman who lived on the other side of the hill, and now she was sailing to America to marry her third. He's healthy, he doesn't drink, he doesn't gamble, that's all I needed to know. One of us was a former dancing girl from Nagoya who dressed beautifully, and had translucent white skin, and knew everything there was to know about men, and it was to her we turned every night with our questions. How long will it last? With the lamp lit or in the dark? Legs up or down? Eyes open or closed? What if I can't breathe? What if I get thirsty? What if he is too heavy? What if he is too big? What if he does not want me at all? "Men are really quite simple," she told us. And then she began to explain.<br><br>On the boat we sometimes lay awake for hours in the swaying damp darkness of the hold, filled with longing and dread, and wondered how we would last another three weeks.<br><br>On the boat we carried with us in our trunks all the things we would need for our new lives: white silk kimonos for our wedding night, colorful cotton kimonos for everyday wear, plain cotton kimonos for when we grew old, calligraphy brushes, thick black sticks of ink, thin sheets of rice paper on which to write long letters home, tiny brass Buddhas, ivory statues of the fox god, dolls we had slept with since we were five, bags of brown sugar with which to buy favors, bright cloth quilts, paper fans, English phrase books, flowered silk sashes, smooth black stones from the river that ran behind our house, a lock of hair from a boy we had once touched, and loved, and promised to write, even though we knew we never would, silver mirrors given to us by our mothers, whose last words still rang in our ears. You will see: women are weak, but mothers are strong.<br><br>On the boat we complained about everything. Bedbugs. Lice. Insomnia. The constant dull throb of the engine, which worked its way even into our dreams. We complained about the stench from the latrines-huge, gaping holes that opened out onto the sea-and our own slowly ripening odor, which seemed to grow more pungent by the day. We complained about Kazuko's aloofness, Chiyo's throat clearing, Fusayo's incessant humming of the "Teapicker's Song," which was driving us all slowly crazy. We complained about our disappearing hairpins-who among us was the thief?-and how the girls from first class had never once said hello from beneath their violet silk parasols in all the times they had walked past us up above on the deck. Just who do they think they are? We complained about the heat. The cold. The scratchy wool blankets. We complained about our own complaining. Deep down, though, most of us were really very happy, for soon we would be in America with our new husbands, who had written to us many times over the months. I have bought a beautiful house. You can plant tulips in the garden. Daffodils. Whatever you like. I own a farm. I operate a hotel. I am the president of a large bank. I left Japan several years ago to start my own business and can provide for you well. I am 179 centimeters tall and do not suffer from leprosy or lung disease and there is no history of madness in my family. I am a native of Okayama. Of Hyogo. Of Miyagi. Of Shizuoka. I grew up in the village next to yours and saw you once years ago at a fair. I will send you the money for your passage as soon as I can.<br><br>On the boat we carried our husbands' pictures in tiny oval lockets that hung on long chains from our necks. We carried them in silk purses and old tea tins and red lacquer boxes and in the thick brown envelopes from America in which they had originally been sent. We carried them in the sleeves of our kimonos, which we touched often, just to make sure they were still there. We carried them pressed flat between the pages of Come, Japanese! and Guidance for Going to America and Ten Ways to Please a Man and old, well-worn volumes of the Buddhist sutras, and one of us, who was Christian, and ate meat, and prayed to a different and longer-haired god, carried hers between the pages of a King James Bible. And when we asked her which man she liked better-the man in the photograph or the Lord Jesus Himself-she smiled mysteriously and replied, "Him, of course."<br><br>Several of us on the boat had secrets, which we swore we would keep from our husbands for the rest of our lives. Perhaps the real reason we were sailing to America was to track down a long-lost father who had left the family years before. He went to Wyoming to work in the coal mines and we never heard from him again. Or perhaps we were leaving behind a young daughter who had been born to a man whose face we could now barely recall-a traveling storyteller who had spent a week in the village, or a wandering Buddhist priest who had stopped by the house late one night on his way to Mt. Fuji.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>No Surrender: My Thirty-Year War (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>The Japanese second lieutenant records his thirty-year ordeal as a guerrilla fighter in the Philippine jungle, refusing to believe that World War II had ended</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Transformers Rescue Bots: Storybook Collection</h2><p>Roll to rescue with this 9x9 storybook collection based on the hit TV show! <br>This storybook bind-up features SEVEN amazing <i>Rescue Bots</i> stories, including: <i>The Mystery of the Pirate Bell, </i><i>Return of the Dinobot, </i><i>The Ghosts of Griffin Rock,</i><i> Land Before Prime, </i><i>Blast Off!, </i><i>Attack of the Movie Monsters!, </i>and<i> Dangerous Rescue.</i><br><br>�2016 Hasbro.

How has your perspective changed since you wrote your first one? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> I wrote my first book on faith when Bill Clinton was president, and I was in a much better mood. I wrote <i>Plan B</i> during the run-up to war in Iraq, and the ensuing catastrophe, so I was very angry, but trying to reconcile that pain and hostility to Jesus's insistence that we are made of love, to love, and be loved, to forgive and be forgiven. Some days went better than others. Also, my son Sam was in his early teens, and that was a LOT easier than when he turned 16 and 17, his ages when I was writing the pieces in <i>Grace (Eventually)</i>.</p><p> In general, I think <i>Grace (Eventually)</i> is a less angry book. I like how I'm aging, except that my back hurts more often, my knees crack like twigs when I squat, and my memory fails more frequently, in more public and therefore humiliating ways. But I think I complain less. As my best friend said when she was dying, and I was obsessing about my butt, "You just don't have that kind of time." </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What does grace mean for you? How can we better communicate it to each other? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> Grace is that extra bit of help when you think you are really doomed; also, not coincidentally, when you have finally run out of good ideas on how to proceed, and on how better to control the people or circumstances that are frustrating or defeating you. I experience Grace as a cool ribbon of fresh air when I feel spiritually claustrophobic. Sometimes I experience it as water-wings, something holding me up when I am afraid that I'm going down, or the tide is carrying me away. I know that Grace meets us whereever we are, but does not leave us where it found us. Sometimes it is so small--a couple of seconds relief here, several extra inches there. I wish it were big and obvious, like sky-writing. Oh, well. Grace is not something I DO, or can chase down; but it is something I can receive, when I stop trying to be in charge. </p><p> We communicate grace to one another by holding space for people when they are hurt or terrified, instead of trying to fix them, or manage their emotions for them. We offer ourselves as silent companionship, or gentle listening when someone feels very alone. We get people glasses of water when they are thirsty. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Many of the essays in <i>Grace (Eventually)</i> first appeared in Salon, the online magazine, and that's the way that many readers first found you. How do you see the Internet changing the way people read and write? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> The Internet makes everything so immediate and spontaneous, which I totally love--UNLESS it has to do with the immediacy of people's negative response to me. Several of the Salon pieces in Grace--for instance, the story about the horrible fight with my son, and the piece about turning the other cheek while being ripped off by The Carpet Guy--generated a couple hundred letters, many of them extremely hostile. Perhaps "spewy" would be a better description. I also sometimes get knee-jerk responses to my mentions of Jesus in my Salon pieces that seem to lump me in the same tradition as Jerry Falwell. But for the most part, I love the populism and egalitarian nature of the Internet: everyone counts the same. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What stories do people tell you, when they've read your books or know you are a writer? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> People tell me how relieved they are that I try to tell the truth about how hard it can be to be a mother, or a daughter, or an American in these times. They tell me stories about how awful their own teenagers can be, or how awful they themselves behaved towards their kids or parents; how hard it was to finally be able to adore their mothers, or to forgive their fathers. They tell me their sobriety dates. They whisper to me that they are Christians, too. </p><p> Also, they ask if I am able to read their manuscripts, and the name of my agent, and my e-mail address. They ask if we are going to survive the current political difficulties--and I promise them we are. They ask how old my son is now--17 and a half--and how he is doing, which is fantastically, after some of the hard months I wrote about in <i>Grace</i>. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong>What lessons do you think you can pass on to others: to your readers, to your son? What lessons does it seem like people have to learn for themselves? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> All I have to offer is my own truth, my own experience, strength and hope. I can pass on the tool of a God Box, and how for 20 years I have been putting tiny notes in mine and promising God I will keep my sticky fingers off the controls until I hear God's wisdom: sometimes I get an answer because the phone rings, or the mail comes, but at any rate, during every single terrible problem and tragedy, I have been given enough guidance and stamina and even humor to bear up, and be transformed, for the good. I always tell Sam that if you want to make God laugh, tell Her your plans. I tell Sam that if he listens to his best thinking, he will suffer: and to listen to his heart instead, to listen in the silence, and to seek wise counsel. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You've written nearly a dozen books (including an incredibly popular guide to writing): does writing get any easier? Does it get harder? </p><p><strong>Lamott:</strong> In a very important way, writing gets easier, because I've been doing it full time now for thirty-plus years, and just as you would get better and better if you practiced your scales on a piano, I've gotten better, and can try harder and harder pieces. But writing is always hard. It does not come naturally to me at all. I sit down at the same time every day, which lets my subconscious realize it's time to get to work. I give myself very short assignments, and let myself write really terrible first drafts. But I grapple with the exact same problems every writer does, which is having equal proportions of self-loathing and grandiosity. I sort of live by the Nike ads: Just Do It. So I sit down. I show up. I do it by pre-arrangement with myself, because I know I'll feel sad and terrible if I shirk on that days writing. I do it as a debt of honor, to myself, and to whatever it is that has given me this gift of being able to tell stories, and to make people laugh. Laughter is carbonated holiness. Other people's good writing is medicine for me, and I hope mine is too, for my readers. </p><strong>Anne Lamott</strong> is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Help, Thanks, Wow,</em><em>Some Assembly Required,</em> <em>Grace (Eventually),</em> <em>Plan B</em>, and several others.

Left alone for twenty years when Odysseus goes off to fight in the Trojan war after the abduction of Helen, Penelope manages, in the face of scandalous rumours, to maintain the kingdom of Ithaca, bring up her wayward son, and keep over a hundred suitors at bay, simultaneously. When Odysseus finally comes home after enduring hardships, overcoming monsters and sleeping with goddesses, he kills her suitors and--curiously--twelve of her maids.<br><br>In a splendid contemporary twist to the ancient story, Margaret Atwood has chosen to give the telling of it to Penelope and to her twelve hanged Maids, asking: "What led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope really up to?" In Atwood&#x2019;s dazzling, playful retelling, the story becomes as wise and compassionate as it is haunting, and as wildly entertaining as it is disturbing. With wit and verve, drawing on the storytelling and poetic talent for which she herself is renowned, she gives Penelope new life and reality--and sets out to provide an answer to an ancient mystery.</p><p><p>Margaret Atwood is the author of more than forty volumes of poetry, children&#x2019;s literature, fiction, and non-fiction, but is best known for her novels, which include&nbsp;<i>The Edible Woman</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale</i>&nbsp;(1985),&nbsp;<i>The Robber Bride</i>&nbsp;(1994),&nbsp;<i>Alias Grace&nbsp;</i>(1996), and&nbsp;<i>The Blind Assassin</i>, which won the prestigious Booker Prize in 2000.&nbsp;A book of short stories called&nbsp;<i>Stone Mattress: Nine Tales</i>&nbsp;was published in 2014.

This is what I wished would happen, but like so many of my wishes it failed to come true. I know only a few factoids that I didn&#x2019;t know before. It&#x2019;s much too high a price to pay for the satisfaction of curiosity, needless to say.<br>Since being dead &#x2014; since achieving this state of bonelessness, liplessness, breastlessness &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve learned some things I would rather not know, as one does when listening at windows or opening other people&#x2019;s letters. You think you&#x2019;d like to read minds? Think again.<br><br>Down here everyone arrives with a sack, like the sacks used to keep the winds in, but each of these sacks is full of words &#x2014; words you&#x2019;ve spoken, words you&#x2019;ve heard, words that have been said about you. Some sacks are very small, others large; my own is of a reasonable size, though a lot of the words in it concern my eminent husband. What a fool he made of me, some say. It was a specialty of his: making fools. He got away with everything, which was another of his specialties: getting away.<br><br>He was always so plausible. Many people have believed that his version of events was the true one, give or take a few murders, a few beautiful seduct�resses, a few one-eyed monsters. Even I believed him, from time to time. I knew he was tricky and a liar, I just didn&#x2019;t think he would play his tricks and try out his lies on me. Hadn&#x2019;t I been faithful? Hadn&#x2019;t I waited, and waited, and waited, despite the temptation &#x2014; almost the compulsion &#x2014; to do otherwise? And what did I amount to, once the official version gained ground? An edifying legend. A stick used to beat other women with. Why couldn&#x2019;t they be as considerate, as trustworthy, as all-suffering as I had been? That was the line they took, the singers, the yarn-spinners. Don&#x2019;t follow my example, I want to scream in your ears &#x2014; yes, yours! But when I try to scream, I sound like an owl.<br><br>Of course I had inklings, about his slipperiness, his wiliness, his foxiness, his &#x2014; how can I put this? &#x2014; his unscrupulousness, but I turned a blind eye. I kept my mouth shut; or, if I opened it, I sang his praises. I didn&#x2019;t contradict, I didn&#x2019;t ask awkward questions, I didn&#x2019;t dig deep. I wanted happy endings in those days, and happy endings are best achieved by keeping the right doors locked and going to sleep during the rampages.<br><br>But after the main events were over and things had become less legendary, I realized how many people were laughing at me behind my back &#x2014; how they were jeering, making jokes about me, jokes both clean and dirty; how they were turning me into a story, or into several stories, though not the kind of stories I&#x2019;d prefer to hear about myself. What can a woman do when scandalous gossip travels the world? If she defends herself she sounds guilty. So I waited some more.<br><br>Now that all the others have run out of air, it&#x2019;s my turn to do a little story-making. I owe it to myself. I&#x2019;ve had to work myself up to it: it&#x2019;s a low art, tale-telling. Old women go in for it, strolling beggars, blind singers, maidservants, children &#x2014; folks with time on their hands. Once, people would have laughed if I&#x2019;d tried to play the minstrel &#x2014; there&#x2019;s nothing more preposterous than an aristocrat fumbling around with the arts &#x2014; but who cares about public opinion now? The opinion of the people down here: the opinion of shadows, of echoes. So I&#x2019;ll spin a thread of my own.<br><br>The difficulty is that I have no mouth through which I can speak. I can&#x2019;t make myself understood, not in your world, the world of bodies, of tongues and fingers; and most of the time I have no listeners, not on your side of the river. Those of you who may catch the odd whisper, the odd squeak, so easily mistake my words for breezes rustling the dry reeds, for bats at twilight, for bad dreams.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve always been of a determined nature.

In that case, his wish to drown me came from an understandable desire to protect himself. But he must have misheard, or else the oracle herself misheard &#x2014; the gods often mumble &#x2014; because it was not his shroud that was at issue, but my father-in-law&#x2019;s shroud.

He and his wife reside in Forest, Virginia.Genesis INTRODUCTION The first phrase in the Hebrew text of 1:1 is bereshith ("in [the] beginning"), which is also the He-brew title of the book (books in ancient times customarily were named after their first word or two). The English title, Genesis, is Greek in origin and comes from the word geneseos, which appears in the Greek translation (Septuagint) of 2:4; 5:1. Depending on its context, the word can mean "birth," "genealogy," or "history of origin." In both its Hebrew and Greek forms, then, the title of Genesis appropriately describes its contents, since it is primarily a book of beginnings. Background Chs. 1&#x2014;38 reflect a great deal of what we know from other sources about ancient Mesopotamian life and culture. Creation, genealogies, destructive floods, geography and mapmaking, construction techniques, migrations of peoples, sale and purchase of land, legal customs and procedures, sheep-herding and cattle-raising&#x2014;all these subjects and many others were matters of vital concern to the peoples of Mesopotamia during this time. They were also of interest to the individuals, families and tribes of whom we read in the first 38 chapters of Genesis. The author appears to locate Eden, man&#x2019;s first home, in or near Mesopotamia; the tower of Babel was built there; Abram was born there; Isaac took a wife from there; and Jacob lived there for 20 years. Although these patriarchs settled in Ca-naan, their original homeland was Mesopotamia. The closest ancient literary parallels to Gen 1&#x2014;38 also come from Mesopotamia. Enuma elish, the story of the god Marduk&#x2019;s rise to supremacy in the Babylonian pantheon, is similar in some respects (though thoroughly mythical and polytheistic) to the Gen 1 creation account. Some of the features of certain king lists from Sumer bear striking resemblance to the genealogy in Gen 5. The 11th tablet of the Gilgamesh epic is quite similar in outline to the flood narrative in Gen 6&#x2014;8. Several of the major events of Gen 1&#x2014;8 are narrated in the same order as similar events in the Atrahasis epic. In fact, the latter features the same basic motif of creation-rebellion-flood as the Biblical account. Clay tablets found recently at the ancient (c. 2500&#x2013;2300 B.C.) site of Ebla (modern Tell Mardikh) in northern Syr-ia may also contain some intriguing parallels (see chart, p.). Two other important sets of documents demonstrate the reflection of Mesopotamia in the first 38 chapters of Genesis. From the Mari letters (see chart, p. ***), dating from the patriarchal period, we learn that the names of the patriarchs (including especially Abram, Jacob and Job) were typical of that time. The letters also clearly illustrate the freedom of travel that was possible between various parts of the Amorite world in which the patriarchs lived. The Nuzi tablets (see chart, p. ***), though a few centuries later than the patriarchal period, shed light on patriarchal customs, which tended to survive virtually intact for many centuries. The inheritance right of an adopted household member or slave (see 15:1&#x2013;4), the obligation of a barren wife to furnish her husband with sons through a servant girl (see 16:2&#x2013;4), strictures against expelling such a servant girl and her son (see 21:10&#x2013;11), the authority of oral statements in ancient Near Eastern law, such as the deathbed bequest (see 27:1&#x2013;4,22&#x2013;23,33)&#x2014;these and other legal customs, social contracts and provisions are graphically il-lustrated in Mesopotamian documents. As Gen 1&#x2014;38 is Mesopotamian in character and background, so chs. 39&#x2014;50 reflect Egyptian influence&#x2014; though in not quite so direct a way. Examples of such influence are: Egyptian grape cultivation (40:9&#x2013;11), the riverside scene (ch. 41), Egypt as Canaan&#x2019;s breadbasket (ch. 42), Canaan as the source of numerous products for Egyptian consumption (ch. 43), Egyptian religious and social customs (the end of chs. 43; 46), Egyptian administrative procedures (ch. 47), Egyptian funerary practices (ch. 50) and several Egyptian words and names used throughout these chapters. The closest specific literary parallel from Egypt is the Tale of Two Brothers, which bears some resemblance to the story of Joseph and Potiphar&#x2019;s wife (ch. 39). Egyptian autobiographical narratives (such as the Story is in turn composed of three narrative cycles (Abraham-Isaac, 11:27&#x2014;25:11; Isaac-Jacob, 25:19&#x2014; 35:29; 37:1; Jacob-Joseph, 37:2&#x2014;50:26), interspersed by the genealogies of Ishmael (25:12&#x2013;18) and Esau (ch. 36). The narrative frequently concentrates on the life of a later son in preference to the firstborn: Seth over Cain, Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Judah and Joseph over their brothers, and Ephraim over Manasseh. Such emphasis on divinely chosen men and their families is perhaps the most obvious literary and theological characteristic of the book of Genesis as a whole. It strikingly underscores the fact that the people of God are not the product of natural human developments, but are the result of God&#x2019;s sovereign and gracious intrusion in human history. He brings out of the fallen human race a new humanity consecrated to Himself, called and destined to be the people of His kingdom and the channel of His blessing to the whole earth. Numbers with symbolic significance figure prominently in Genesis. The number ten, in addition to being the number of sections into which Genesis is divided, is also the number of names appear-ing in the genealogies of chs. 5 and 11 (see note on 5:5). The number seven also occurs frequently. The Hebrew text of 1:1 consists of exactly seven words and that of 1:2 of exactly 14 (twice seven). There are seven days of creation, seven names in the genealogy of ch. 4 (see note on 4:17&#x2013;18; see also 4:15,24; 5:31), various sevens in the flood story, 70 descendants of Noah&#x2019;s sons (ch. 10), a sevenfold promise to Abram (12:2&#x2013;3), seven years of abundance and then seven of famine in Egypt (ch. 41), and 70 descendants of Jacob (ch. 46). Other significant numbers, such as 12 and 40, are used with similar frequency.</p><h2>The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency</h2><p><b>The first in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the White House Chiefs of Staff, whose actions&#x2014;and inactions&#x2014;have defined the course of our country.</b><br><br> What do Dick Cheney and Rahm Emanuel have in common? Aside from polarizing personalities, both served as chief of staff to the president of the United States&#x2014;as did Donald Rumsfeld, Leon Panetta, and a relative handful of others. The chiefs of staff, often referred to as "the gatekeepers," wield tremendous power in Washington and beyond; they decide who is allowed to see the president, negotiate with Congress to push POTUS's agenda, and&#x2014;most crucially&#x2014;enjoy unparalleled access to the leader of the free world. Each chief can make or break an administration, and each president reveals himself by the chief he picks.&nbsp;<br><br> Through extensive, intimate interviews with all seventeen<b>&nbsp;</b>living chiefs and two former presidents, award-winning journalist and producer Chris Whipple pulls back the curtain on this unique fraternity. In doing so, he revises our understanding of presidential history, showing us how James Baker&#x2019;s expert managing of the White House, the press, and Capitol Hill paved the way for the Reagan Revolution&#x2014;and, conversely, how Watergate, the Iraq War, and even the bungled Obamacare rollout might<b>&nbsp;</b>have been prevented by a more effective chief.&nbsp;<br><br> Filled with shrewd analysis and never-before-reported details,&nbsp;<i>The Gatekeepers</i>&nbsp;offers an essential portrait of the toughest job in Washington.</p><p>CHRIS WHIPPLE is an acclaimed writer, journalist, documentary filmmaker, and speaker.

Most recently, he was the executive producer and writer of Showtime's <i>The Spymasters: CIA in the Crosshairs.</i>***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof***<br><br>Copyright � 2017 Chris Whipple<br><br><p>Introduction</p><p>&#x201c;I Brought My Pillow and My Blankie&#x201d;</p><p>Rahm Emanuel was so cold he could see his breath as he crossed the White House parking lot and entered the West Wing lobby. It was December 5, 2008, an unusually frigid morning in Washington, D.C. But it wasn&#x2019;t the weather that sent a chill through Emanuel; it was the unbelievably daunting challenge that lay ahead.</p><p>In just six weeks Emanuel would become White House chief of staff to Barack Obama, the forty-fourth president of the United States. But for more than a month, he had watched in astonishment as the world they were about to inherit was turned upside down. The U.S. economy was teetering on the edge of another Great Depression. Credit&#x2014;the lifeblood of the world economy&#x2014;was frozen. The entire auto industry was on the brink of collapse. Two bloody wars were mired in stalemate. There was more than a little truth, Emanuel thought, to the headline in <i>The Onion</i>: &#x201c;Black Man Given Nation&#x2019;s Worst Job.&#x201d; The stiletto-tongued infighter, former senior adviser</p><p>to Bill Clinton, and congressman from Illinois felt apprehensive. &#x201c;I brought my pillow and my blankie," he would later joke, looking back at that dark morning when the fate of the new administration seemed to hang in the balance. The truth was, Rahm Emanuel was scared.</p><p>The unannounced gathering at the White House that morning looked like a Cold War-era national security crisis. Black sedans and SUVs rolled up; men in dark suits clambered into the Executive Mansion. Emanuel thought about the elite fraternity that was assem�bling here: Donald Rumsfeld. Dick Cheney. Leon Panetta. Howard Baker Jr. Jack Watson. Ken Duberstein. John Sununu. Sam Skinner. Mack McLarty. John Podesta. Andrew Card. Joshua Bolten. They were among Washington's most powerful figures of the last half cen�tury: secretaries of defense, OMB directors, governor, CIA director, majority leader, and vice president. But they had one thing above all in common. It was a special bond, a shared trial by fire that tran�scended their political differences: Every one of them had served as White House chief of staff</p><p>As they gathered in the office they had all once occupied-now home to Joshua Bolten, George W. Bush's current chief-they min�gled and swapped stories. It had been Bolten's idea to bring all the former White House chiefs together after the election, to give his successor advice on how to do the job. Bolten guessed that of the thirteen living chiefs, maybe a half dozen would actually show up. But to his amazement, only Reagan's James Baker and Clinton's Erskine Bowles were no-shows.</p><p>"It really was an amazing day," recalls John Podesta, Clinton's final chief, "because it was quite a collection of individuals: from Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to me and Rahm. The span of ideology and politics, the span of history was all very present. And we all got the chance to give Rahm one piece of advice." Clin� ton's gregarious former chief Leon Panetta, about to be tapped as Obama's CIA director, was in his element: "All of them were my close friends," he recalls. "And to have them together in that room to wish Rahm Emanuel the best in his entry into that rogues&#x2019; gallery of chiefs of staff&#x2014;that was a very special moment.&#x201d;</p><p>The ghosts of presidencies past hovered around them. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a space where you feel the presence of history,&#x201d; Bolten would recall. &#x201c;They were all transported back to their time in office.&#x201d;</p><p>Dick Cheney, once the thirty-four-year-old chief of staff to Pres- ident Gerald Ford, pointed to the spot on the floor where Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, immobilized by a bad back, used to lie supine during meetings, declaiming on monetary and fiscal policy. A fire crackled in the corner fireplace below a magnificent oil portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Finally, Bolten called the gathering to order and herded his distinguished guests around a long table.</p><p>At opposite ends sat two men whose political fortunes had been linked for a generation: Cheney, who would be vice president for six more weeks; and Rumsfeld, who had resigned under fire as defense secretary. It was Rumsfeld who had taken Cheney under his wing as a young political science grad student in the Nixon White House&#x2014; and then summoned him to serve as his deputy when he became Gerald Ford&#x2019;s chief of staff. Together they had helped Ford cobble together his &#x201c;accidental presidency&#x201d; after the trauma of Watergate; they had also watched helplessly as South Vietnam was overrun by Communist forces, bringing a bloody and ignominious end to the longest war in U.S. history. Thirty years later, during the Iraq War, Cheney, the prot�g�, would be called upon by George W. Bush to tell his mentor to step down as defense secretary. As the prime architects of another divisive conflict that was ending badly, Cheney and Rumsfeld had come full circle.</p><p>Cheney was impressed by the morning&#x2019;s gathering. &#x201c;This was unique in that you had all or nearly all of the living former chiefs of staff in the room at the same time,&#x201d; he recalls. And the irony of giving advice to Barack Obama&#x2019;s top adviser was not lost on him: &#x201c;Obama had spent the better part of his campaign trashing us from one end of the country to the other. But he&#x2019;s our president. By that stage he&#x2019;d won the election. And when you're all sitting around the table and getting ready to say, 'Here are the keys to the men's room,' you really do want to take advantage of the opportunity to say, 'Look, here's a couple of things that you really need to keep in mind.'"</p><p>Presidential transitions are awkward, and Cheney had been through his share. "There's always a certain amount of hubris in�volved for the new crowd coming in: 'Well, if you guys are so smart, why did we beat you?' And so it can get a little tense at times, but you've got to overcome those things, because there aren't very many people who've run the White House. And there are valuable lessons to be learned. You really do want to try to equip the new guy with whatever wisdom you've acquired during the course of your time in office."</p><p>It was a moment of bipartisanship that would seem almost incon�ceivable today, a throwback to a bygone era of civility. "There was a sense in that room,'' says Podesta, "among Republicans and Demo� crats, that the country needed people to get together and find some leadership." Even the notoriously partisan Emanuel gave his Repub�lican counterparts the benefit of the doubt. "I think they knew how difficult this moment in time was historically,'' he recalls. "I think everyone was wishing the administration well." He did something few had ever seen him do before: He pulled out a pen and started to take notes.</p><p>Going around the table, one at a time, Bolten asked his guests to give the incoming chief their advice.</p><p>Fifty years of presidential history were represented, and no one knew that history better than Ken Duberstein. Cherubic and vol�uble, with a booming laugh, Brooklyn-born Duberstein had been Ronald Reagan's chief of staff during his last year in office, and the first Jew to hold the job. "President Reagan didn't hire me for my good looks,'' he liked to tell people. "He hired me because he knew that I would tell him straight-because that is the Brooklyn way." (After leaving the White House, he set up shop on Pennsylvania Avenue, offering strategic planning to corporate clients.) Duberstein had been chief for just six months&#x2014;yet no one understood the job, or its nuances, better; not just companies, but presidents consulted him, hoping the Reagan magic might rub off. And few told more dramatic stories about being a witness to presidential history. At the height of the Cold War, accompanying Reagan to a speech at West Berlin&#x2019;s Brandenburg Gate, it was Duberstein who urged the president to ignore the objections of his State Department and deliver his iconic challenge to the Soviet Union: &#x201c;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&#x201d;</p><p>Now, in another time of crisis, Duberstein spoke first. &#x201c;Always remember,&#x201d; he said, looking at Emanuel, &#x201c;that when you open your mouth, it is not you but <i>the president </i>who is speaking.&#x201d; Emanuel stared back at him. &#x201c;Oh, <i>shit</i>!&#x201d; he said.</p><p>The chiefs erupted in laughter. Next up was Jack Watson. Now seventy, square-jawed and handsome, Watson looked like a movie star; that&#x2019;s what Jimmy Carter thought when the charismatic young Atlanta lawyer rode out on his motorcycle to meet the future president at his peanut farm more than forty years ago. As a young marine in an elite special operations unit, Watson had set an obstacle course record at Quantico that stood for more than twenty years; charming, earnest, and silver-tongued, he became a successful trial lawyer, and one of Carter&#x2019;s trusted advisers during his 1976 presidential campaign. &#x201c;Jack isn&#x2019;t normal,&#x201d; says one of his colleagues. &#x201c;I mean, he was injected with the perfect serum. If you want to criticize him, he&#x2019;s too good to be true.&#x201d; Watson had been put in charge of Carter&#x2019;s transition, and many believed he was a contender to become his White House chief of staff. But in a fateful decision that would hobble his presidency, Carter refused to appoint a chief. (Two and a half years later, Carter remedied that but then compounded his mistake by giving the job to a person who was unsuited to it, a brilliant but disorganized political strategist named Hamilton Jordan.) With less than eight months left in his term, Carter finally gave the job to Watson. In that brief period, Watson earned the respect of his peers for his keen grasp of the position&#x2014;a job he likened to a &#x201c; javelin catcher." He looked at Rahm and smiled. "Never forget the extraor�dinary opportunity you've been given to serve, and the privilege and responsibility that it represents," he said. "You are sitting next to the most powerful person in the world. Remember to value and appreci�ate that fact every single day you're here."</p><p>John Podesta, the head of Obama's transition team, was next. Grandson of an Italian immigrant, son of a Chicago factory worker, Podesta had been bitten by the political bug as a college scholarship student back in 1970, when he volunteered for a Connecticut Senate campaign-and met a wonkish Yale Law School student named Bill Clinton. Decades later, in the Clinton White House, Podesta would succeed Erskine Bowles as chief of staff. In the throes of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Podesta was so well known for his hair-trigger temper that it was said he had an evil twin named "Skippy." But this morning he preached humility and patience. "You've got to slow down, and listen," he said. "You've got a lot of smart people who are in that building with you. And you've got to resist the temptation to always have the answer. Slow down, listen. You'll learn a lot and you'll make better decisions."</p><p>Thomas F. "Mack" McLarty, the Arkansas businessman who had</p><p>been Bill Clinton's first chief of staff, knew better than anyone just how unforgiving the job could be. Courtly and charming, "Mack the Nice," as he was known, was liked by almost everyone in Wash�ington. But he had been a stranger to Capitol Hill and unschooled in its bare-knuckled wars. After a year and a half, with Clinton's agenda stymied and reelection in jeopardy, McLarty had agreed to step down as chief. But everyone in this room could empathize; they had all served at the whim of their presidents, and more than a few had been fired. Some thought McLarty was too kind, too gentlemanly for the job; if pressed, Mack might have agreed. "Try to keep some perspective about what you're doing and try to maintain your hu�manity," he told Rahm. "You don't always succeed. We're all human and we make mistakes. It starts with recognizing what a privilege it is to serve the president of the United States, but more importantly, the people of this country. Keep that in perspective and don&#x2019;t let it get out of proportion with this regal title of &#x2018;chief of staff.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>McLarty&#x2019;s admonition could have been aimed squarely at an- other man seated at the table, John Sununu. George H. W. Bush had picked the combative ex-governor of New Hampshire as his chief, hoping that Sununu&#x2019;s domestic policy chops would complement his own foreign policy expertise. Sununu liked to tell people&#x2014;with a wink&#x2014;that he was &#x201c;just a warm, fuzzy pussycat.&#x201d; In fact, he flaunted his image as the president&#x2019;s son of a bitch like a badge of honor. Arrogant and confrontational, Sununu antagonized Congress, the press corps, and the White House staff alike. Later, when he was caught using government limousines and planes for personal trips, few came to his defense. Sununu would resign under a cloud. &#x201c;You have to create a firewall between the president and those who are clawing to see the president,&#x201d; he told Rahm. &#x201c;Even if it creates problems for the chief of staff. I was <i>very good </i>at creating problems for the chief of staff.&#x201d;</p><p>Leon Panetta was probably the most popular person in the room. The son of Italian immigrants, jovial and outgoing, he was equally at home on his walnut farm in Monterey, California, and in the corridors of the West Wing. But as Bill Clinton&#x2019;s second chief&#x2014; replacing McLarty&#x2014;Panetta had wielded an iron fist inside a velvet glove. When he arrived, Clinton&#x2019;s presidency was on the ropes, his ambitious agenda threatened by fights over gays in the military, the Whitewater scandal, and other distractions. The damage was self-inflicted, caused by Clinton&#x2019;s indiscipline and sloppy staff work. Panetta stepped in and brought discipline and focus to the White House&#x2014;enabling Clinton to regain his traction and go on to win a second term. Now it was Panetta&#x2019;s turn to tutor Obama&#x2019;s incoming chief: &#x201c;Always, always, be straight and honest with the president of the United States,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Always tell him what he may not want to hear&#x2014;because frankly, a lot of people in the White House will always tell the president what he <i>wants </i>to hear.&#x201d;</p><p>Andrew Card, Bolten&#x2019;s predecessor, had set the modern record for longevity as chief: five years and three months under George W. Bush. Yet Card, who had served five presidents, was intimidated, almost awed by the company this morning. "These were truly his� toric people who served during phenomenally historic times and it was quite compelling because they're all very wise," he would recall. When it came his turn, Card urged Rahm to protect the office of the presidency: "A lot of people aren't interested in protecting the in�stitution of the presidency, Article 2 in the Constitution. In fact, it's under attack almost all the time from Article 1, which is Congress, and Article 3, the courts. And there really aren't too many people at the White House that pay attention to that."</p><p>Next, all eyes turned to Donald Rumsfeld. The pugnacious, suffer-no-fools architect of the Iraq invasion, George Bush's em�battled defense secretary had been asked to resign after the bungling of the occupation and the scandals at Abu Ghraib. Bolten, who had brought the chiefs together this morning, had been instrumental in Rumsfeld's firing.</p><p>And yet, around this table Rumsfeld was respected for an earlier incarnation-as Gerald R. Ford's remarkably effective chief of staff. In the aftermath of the biggest scandal in American history, with Ford plummeting in...</p></p><h2>Galileo&#39;s Dream</h2><p>The winner of every major science fiction award, Kim Stanley Robinson is a novelist who looks ahead with optimism even while acknowledging the steep challenges facing our planet and species: a clear-eyed realist who has not forgotten how to dream. His new novel offers his most audacious dream yet. At the heart of a brilliant narrative that stretches from Renaissance Italy to the moons of Jupiter is one man, the father of modern science: Galileo Galilei.<br><br>To the inhabitants of the Jovian moons, Galileo is a revered figure whose actions will influence the subsequent history of the human race. From the summit of their distant future, a charismatic renegade named Ganymede travels to the past to bring Galileo forward in an attempt to alter history and ensure the ascendancy of science over religion. And if that means Galileo must be burned at the stake, so be it.<br><br>Yet between his brief and jarring visitations to this future, Galileo must struggle against the ignorance and superstition of his own time. And it is here that Robinson is at his most brilliant, showing Galileo in all his contradictions and complexity. Robinson's Galileo is a tour de force of imaginative and historical empathy: the shining center around which the novel revolves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>From Galileo's heresy trial to the politics of far-future Jupiter, from the canals of Venice to frozen, mysterious Europa, Robinson illuminates the parallels between a distant past and an even more remote future&#x2014;in&nbsp;the process celebrating the human spirit and calling into question the convenient truths of our own moment in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson is a winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards. He is the author of nineteen previous books, including the bestselling Mars trilogy and the critically acclaimed <b>Forty Signs of Rain, Fifty Degrees Below, Sixty Days and Counting, The Years of Rice and Sa</b>lt, and <b>Antarctica.</b> In 2008 he was named a "Hero of the Environment" by Time magazine, and he recently joined in the Sequoia Parks Foundation's Artists in the Back Country program. He lives in Davis, California.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The Stranger All of a sudden Galileo felt that this moment had happened before&#x2014;that he had been standing in the artisans' Friday market outside Venice's Arsenale and had felt someone's gaze on him, and looked up to see a man staring at him, a tall stranger with a beaky narrow face. As before (but what before?) the stranger acknowledged Galileo's gaze with a lift of the chin, then walked toward him through the market, threading through the crowded blankets and tables and stalls spread all over the Campiello del Malvasia. The sense of repetition was strong enough to make Galileo a little dizzy, although a part of his mind was also detached enough to wonder how it might be that you could sense someone's gaze resting on you.<br><br>The stranger came up to Galileo, stopped and bowed stiffly, then held out his right hand. Galileo bowed in return, took the offered hand, and squeezed; it was narrow and long, like the man's face.<br><br>In guttural Latin, very strangely accented, the stranger croaked, "Are you Domino Signor Galileo Galilei, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua?"<br><br>"I am. Who are you?"<br><br>The man let go of his hand. "I am a colleague of Johannes Kepler. He and I recently examined one of your very useful military compasses."<br><br>"I am glad to hear it," Galileo said, surprised. "I have corresponded with Signor Kepler, as he probably told you, but he did not write to me about this. When and where did you meet him?"<br><br>"Last year, in Prague."<br><br>Galileo nodded. Kepler's places of residence had shifted through the years in ways Galileo had not tried to keep track of. In fact he had not answered Kepler's last letter, having failed to get through the book that had accompanied it. "And where are you from?"<br><br>"Northern Europe."<br><br>Alta Europa. The man's Latin was really quite strange, unlike other transalpine versions Galileo had heard. He examined the man more closely, noted his extreme height and thinness, his stoop, his intent close-set eyes. He would have had a heavy beard, but he was very finely shaved. His expensive dark jacket and cloak were so clean they looked new. The hoarse voice, beaky nose, narrow face, and black hair made him seem like a crow turned into a man. Again Galileo felt the uncanny sensation that this meeting had happened before. A crow talking to a bear&#x2014;<br><br>"What city, what country?" Galileo persisted.<br><br>"Echion Linea. Near Morvran."<br><br>"I don't know those towns."<br><br>"I travel extensively." The man's gaze was fixed on Galileo as if on his first meal in a week. "Most recently I was in the Netherlands, and there I saw an instrument that made me think of you, because of your compass, which, as I said, Kepler showed me. This Dutch device was a kind of looking glass."<br><br>"A mirror?"<br><br>"No. A glass to look through. Or rather, a tube you look at things through, with a glass lens at each end. It makes things look bigger."<br><br>"Like a jeweler's lens?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Those only work for things that are close."<br><br>"This one worked for things that were far away."<br><br>"How could that be?"<br><br>The man shrugged.<br><br>This was interesting. "Perhaps it was because there were two lenses," Galileo said. "Were they convex or concave?"<br><br>The man almost spoke, hesitated, then shrugged again. His stare went almost cross-eyed. His eyes were brown, flecked with green and yellow splashes, like Venice's canals near sunset. Finally he said, "I don't know."<br><br>Galileo found this unimpressive. "Do you have one of these tubes?"<br><br>"Not with me."<br><br>"But you have one?"<br><br>"Not of that type. But yes."<br><br>"And so you thought to tell me about it."<br><br>"Yes. Because of your compass. We saw that among its other applications, you could use it to calculate certain distances."<br><br>"Of course." One of the compass's main functions was to range cannon shots. Despite which very few artillery services or officers had ever purchased one. Three hundred and seven, to be precise, had sold over a period of twelve years.<br><br>The stranger said, "Such calculations would be easier if you could see things farther away."<br><br>"Many things would be easier."<br><br>"Yes. And now it can be done."<br><br>"Interesting," Galileo said. "What is your name again, signor?"<br><br>The man looked away uneasily. "I see the artisans are packing to depart. I am keeping you from them, and I must meet a man from Ragusa. We will see each other again."<br><br>With a quick bow he turned and walked along the tall brick side wall of the campiello, hurrying in the direction of the Arsenale, so that Galileo saw him under the emblem of the winged lion of St. Mark that stretched in bas relief over the lintel of the great fortress's entryway. For a second it looked as if one bird-beast were flying over another. Then the man turned the corner and disappeared.<br><br>Galileo turned his attention back to the artisans' market. Some of them were indeed leaving, folding up their blankets in the afternoon shadows and putting their wares into boxes and baskets. During the fifteen or twenty years he had been advising various groups in the Arsenale, he had often dropped by the Friday market to see what might be on display in the way of new tools or devices, machine parts, and so on. Now he wandered around through the familiar faces, moving by habit. But he was distracted. It would be a good thing to be able to see distant objects as if they were close by. Several obvious uses sprang to mind. Military advantages, in fact.<br><br>He made his way to one of the lens-makers' tables, humming a little tune of his father's that came to him whenever he was on the hunt. There would be better lenses in Murano or Florence; here he found nothing but the usual magnifying glasses that one used for close work. He picked up two, held them in the air before his right eye. St. Mark's lion couchant became a flying ivory blur. It was a poorly done bas relief, he saw again with his other eye, very primitive compared to the worn Roman statues under it on either side of the gate.<br><br>Galileo put the lenses back on their table and walked down to the Riva San Biagio, where one of the Padua ferries docked. The splendor of the Serenissima gleamed in the last part of the day. On the riva he sat on his usual post, thinking it over. Most of the people there knew to leave him alone when he was in thought. People still reminded him of the time he had shoved a bargeman into the canal for interrupting his solitude.<br><br>A magnifying glass was convex on both sides. It made things look larger, but only when they were a few fingers from the glass, as Galileo knew very well. His eyes, often painful to him, had in recent years been losing their sharpness for nearby things. He was getting old: a hairy round old man, with failing eyesight. A lens was a help, especially if ground well.<br><br>It was easy to imagine a lens grinder in the course of his work holding up two lenses, one in front of the other, to see what would happen. He was surprised he hadn't done it himself. Although, as he had just discovered, it didn't do much. He could not immediately say why. But he could investigate the phenomenon in his usual manner. At the very least he could look through different kinds of lenses in various combinations, and simply see what he saw.<br><br>There was no wind this Friday afternoon, and the ferry's crew rowed slowly along the Canale della Giudecca and onto the open lagoon, headed for the fondamente at Porta Maghere. The captain's ritual cursing of the oarsmen cut through the cries of the trailing seagulls, sounding like lines from Ruzante. You girls, you rag dolls, my mother rows better than you do&#x2014;<br><br>"Mine definitely does," Galileo pitched in absently, as he always did. The old bitch still had arms like a stevedore. She had been beating the shit out of Marina until he had intervened, that time the two had fought; and Galileo knew full well that Marina was no slouch when it came to landing a punch. Holding them apart, everyone scream- ing . . .<br><br>From his spot in the ferry's bow he faced the setting sun. There had been many years when he would have spent the night in town, usually at Sagredo's pink palazzo&#x2014;"The Ark"&#x2014;with its menagerie of wild creatures and its riotous parties. But now Sagredo was in Aleppo on a diplomatic assignment, and Paolo Sarpi lived in a stone monk's cell, despite his exalted office, and all the rest of Galileo's partners in mischief had also moved away or changed their night habits. No, those years were gone. They had been good years, even though he had been broke&#x2014;as he still was. Work all day in Padua, party all night in Ven?ice. Thus his rides home had usually been on a dawn barge, standing in the bow buzzing with the afterglow of wine and sex, laughter and sleeplessness. On those mornings the sun would pop over the Lido behind them and pour over his shoulders, illuminating the sky and the mirror surface of the lagoon, a space as simple and clear as a good proof: everything washed clean, etched on the eye, glowing with the promise of a day that could bring anything.<br><br>Whereas coming home on the day's last barge, as now, was always a return to the home fire of his life's endlessly tangled problems. The more the western sky blazed in his face, the more likely his mood was to plummet. His temperament was volatile, shifting rapidly among the humors, and every histrionic sunset threatened to make it crash like a pelican diving into the lagoon.<br><br>On this evening, however, the air was clear, and Venus hung high in a lapis lazuli dusk, gleaming like some kind of emblem. And he was still thinking about the stranger and his strange news. Could it be true? And if so, why had no one noticed before?<br><br>On the long dock up the estuary he debarked, and walked over to the line of carts starting out on their night journeys. He hopped on the back of one of the regulars that went to Padua, greeting the driver and lying on his back to watch the stars bounce overhead. By the time the cart rolled past Via Vignali, near the center ...</p><h2>White Teeth</h2><p>A Hay Festival and The Poole VOTE 100 BOOKS for Women Selection &#39;Believe the hype&#39; The Times &#39;The almost preposterous talent was clear from the first pages&#39; Julian Barnes, Guardian The international bestseller and modern classic of multicultural Britain - an unforgettable portrait of London One of the most talked about debut novels of all time, White Teeth is a funny, generous, big-hearted novel, adored by critics and readers alike. Dealing - among many other things - with friendship, love, war, three cultures and three families over three generations, one brown mouse, and the tricky way the past has of coming back and biting you on the ankle, it is a life-affirming, riotous must-read of a book. &#39;Funny, clever ... and a rollicking good read&#39; Independent &#39;Astonishingly assured, funny and serious... I was delighted&#39; Salman Rushdie &#39;Quirky, sassy and wise ... a big, splashy, populous production reminiscent of books by Dickens and Salman Rushdie ... demonstrates both an instinctive storytelling talent and a fully fashioned voice that&#39;s street-smart and learned, sassy and philosophical all at the same time&#39; New York Times &#39;Smith writes like an old hand, and, sometimes, like a dream&#39; New Yorker &#39;Outstanding ... A strikingly clever and funny book with a passion for ideas, for language and for the rich tragic-comedy of life&#39; Sunday Telegraph &#39;Relentlessly funny ... idiosyncratic, and deeply felt&#39; Guardian</p><p>Epic in scale and intimate in approach, <i>White Teeth</i> is a formidably ambitious debut. First novelist Zadie Smith takes on race, sex, class, history, and the minefield of gender politics, and such is her wit and inventiveness that these weighty subjects seem effortlessly light. She also has an impressive geographical range, guiding the reader from Jamaica to Turkey to Bangladesh and back again.<p> Still, the book's home base is a scrubby North London borough, where we encounter Smith's unlikely heroes: prevaricating Archie Jones and intemperate Samad Iqbal, who served together in the so-called Buggered Battalion during World War II. In the ensuing decades, both have gone forth and multiplied: Archie marries beautiful, bucktoothed Clara--who's on the run from her Jehovah's Witness mother--and fathers a daughter. Samad marries stroppy Alsana, who gives birth to twin sons. Here is multiculturalism in its most elemental form: "Children with first and last names on a direct collision course. Names that secrete within them mass exodus, cramped boats and planes, cold arrivals, medical checks."</p><p> Big questions demand boldly drawn characters. Zadie Smith's aren't heroic, just real: warm, funny, misguided, and entirely familiar. Reading their conversations is like eavesdropping. Even a simple exchange between Alsana and Clara about their pregnancies has a comical ring of truth: "A woman has to have the private things--a husband needn't be involved in body business, in a lady's... parts." And the men, of course, have their own involvement in bodily functions: </p><blockquote> The deal was this: on January 1, 1980, like a New Year dieter who gives up cheese on the condition that he can have chocolate, Samad gave up masturbation so that he might drink. It was a deal, a business proposition, that he had made with God: Samad being the party of the first part, God being the sleeping partner. And since that day Samad had enjoyed relative spiritual peace and many a frothy Guinness with Archibald Jones; he had even developed the habit of taking his last gulp looking up at the sky like a Christian, thinking: I'm basically a good man. </blockquote> Not all of <i>White Teeth</i> is so amusingly carnal. The mixed blessings of assimilation, for example, are an ongoing torture for Samad as he watches his sons grow up. "They have both lost their way," he grumbles. "Strayed so far from what I had intended for them. No doubt they will both marry white women called Sheila and put me in an early grave." These classic immigrant fears--of dilution and disappearance--are no laughing matter. But in the end, they're exactly what gives <i>White Teeth</i> its lasting power and undeniable bite. <i>--Eithne Farry</i>&#x201c;A preternaturally gifted new writer [with] a voice that&#x2019;s street-smart and learned, sassy and philosophical all at the same time.&#x201d;&#x2013;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Brilliant....

We must forget the densities of 'history' and simply surrender to the wonder of the story." --Sister Wendy Beckett <p>Sister Wendy's Story of Painting in 450 masterpieces--reproduced in full color--chronicles the developments and movements in painting over the past 800 years from Gothic to Renaissance, Romanticism to Impressionism, and Post-Impressionism to Modernism. Each movement is introduced by visual timelines that provide an instant overview of the important artists and paintings of that era. As she discusses various schools and movements as well as the work of dozens of individuals artists, Sister Wendy not only tackles the technical topics of perspective, color, and symbolism, she delves into the spiritual, political, and personal aspects of each painting, making art come alive for even the most novice admirer. Sister Wendy analyzes more than 30 of the world's most famous paintings, using enlarged details to explain techniques and reveal symbolism in works that include Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, Rembrandt's The Jewish Bride, Monet's The Waterlily Pond, and Van Gogh's Self-Portrait. Sister Wendy's Story of Painting is an accessible overview of a subject often thought to be overwhelming and complex.</p></p><p>For those who've enjoyed the original, the good news is that the new edition of <i>The Story of Painting</i> has grown by more than 300 pages of photographs--magnified close-ups of details from nearly half the 450 paintings in the book. Fauvist paint strokes become mighty slabs; sparkling light on a Dutch still life is revealed as a series of tiny dots; the cheeks of a young man in an Italian Renaissance portrait betray a touch of five o'clock shadow. This kind of close looking is seductive, and it's an important part of Sister Wendy's direct, unpretentious approach to art.<p> As a history of painting, Sister Wendy's book has its strong points (works with religious or spiritual themes and those that lend themselves to psychological interpretation) as well as its lapses (a very skimpy discussion of Cubism and inadequate treatment of works from the late 20th century). Even the title is a bit of a misnomer. The painting in question is purely Western; there is nothing here about Indian or Persian miniatures, or the great tradition of Chinese landscapes.</p><p> But what Sister Wendy alone offers are vivid, personal interpretations that come from a deep well of emotional sympathy with works of art. Who else would notice the way the bagpiper in <i>The Wedding Feast</i> by Pieter Breughel "stares at the porridge with the longing of the truly hungry"? Who else would point out how Venus--the "older woman" pleading with "virile" Adonis not to go off to war in Titian's "Venus and Adonis"--shows us "her superb back and buttocks, beguilingly rounded, full of promise." Rather than portraying Western art as the dutiful production of "masterpieces," she revels in the physicality of paint and the variety of human experience these works represent. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Sister Wendy Beckett is a member of the Notre Dame order, a teaching order of nuns. She studied for her degree in English at St. Anne&#39;s College, Oxford where she graduated with highest honors. After teaching in South Africa, she returned to England in 1970 to live a fully contemplative life under the protection of a Carmelite monastery in Norfolk, where she lives in seclusion to this day. A lifelong art lover and recognized art historian, Sister Wendy began serious study of the subject in 1980.

He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.<br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the&nbsp;Month, November 2011</strong>: It is difficult to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson&#x2019;s <em>Steve Jobs</em> without feeling melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs&#x2019;s focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. <em>--Chris Schluep</em><br> <p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Walter Isaacson </strong><br><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> It's becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs' contradictions contribute to his success?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe he was a genius? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he have regrets? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is his legacy?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his "Think Different" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p> <p> <b>Photo credit:</b> Patrice Gilbert Photography</p>Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been chairman of CNN and the managing editor of Time magazine.

He lives in Montreal, Canada.Grade 4-6&#x2013;In this second book in the series, Sabrina and Daphne continue their family's fairy-tale detective work in the Hudson River town of Ferryport Landing. The village has more than its share of Everafters, a group of fairy-tale characters who escaped persecution in Europe by fleeing to America over 200 years ago. Here, the sisters start attending the local elementary school where the principal just happens to be the Pied Piper of Hamelin and Snow White is a most beloved teacher. Almost instantly, one of their teachers is found dead in his classroom, tied to the ceiling in a spider web. While investigating his murder, the girls uncover a devious plot and get closer to discovering the whereabouts of their missing parents. Free-spirited Daphne is a perfect foil for her older, grumpier sister, Sabrina, whose understandable anger over the loss of her parents is the main theme of this novel. There are as many references to frightening aspects of today's world as there are nods to folklore and sometimes both appear in the same sentence. While this mixing of sensibilities proves that fairy tales can be as dark as reality, it also occasionally trivializes truly upsetting modern problems such as nuclear weapons and child labor. The story is fast paced and the main characters are sympathetic and appealing. The abrupt ending will leave readers hungry for the next book in the series.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen Meulen, Blakely Elementary School, Bainbridge Island, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"You want us to come to a corporate board meeting?"<br><br> "Did I mention that it's in Key West?" Stone asked.<br><br> "Love to," Dino said.<br><br> "Same here," Viv echoed.<br><br> "Joan has found a rental house for me, and I'm told it's comfortable, and she's stocked it with food and drink. Why don't we all stay a few days?"<br><br> "I can get some time off," Viv said.<br><br> "I'll ask my boss," Dino said. Dino was the police commissioner of New York City.<br><br> "The mayor?"<br><br> "No, me. I asked, and I said, 'Sure, it's okay, stay as long as you like.'"<br><br> "You're a very generous boss," Stone said.<br><br> "Thank you. I try to cultivate good employee relations."<br><br> "I can back him up on that," Viv said. "When I was his employee, he cultivated relations with me."<br><br> "I hope he's not that generous with all his employees," Stone said.<br><br> "I hope so, too," Viv replied.<br><br> "You can both hope," Dino said. "When do we leap off?"<br><br> "Saturday morning. Pick me up at ten. We'll be in Key West by four. The board meeting isn't until Friday, but most of us will be playing in a golf tournament on Sunday and Monday."<br><br> "Arthur Steele is getting very generous with his directors, isn't he?"<br><br> "Oh, once in a while he'll spring for a jaunt. They're all staying at the Casa Marina, the old hotel built by Henry Flagler, the railroad guy who built the Breakers in Palm Beach and others in the early part of the last century."<br><br> "So why aren't we staying there?" Dino asked.<br><br> "You want to rub elbows with a lot of suits this weekend?"<br><br> "We'll stay with you," Dino said. "Should I go armed?"<br><br> "I'm not anticipating bandits in the Keys, but suit yourself." Dino always went armed.<br><br> They were wheels-up before noon on Saturday, and Stone�s Citation 3 Plus made the flight easily in one leg, no refueling along the way.<br><br> At Key West International there was an envelope waiting for Stone at the FBO's front desk, containing house keys and a car key and instructions for operating the house, as well as some history of it. The car turned out to be a metallic white Mercedes S-Class convertible with twenty-eight miles on the odometer. They stowed their luggage in the trunk, and Stone put the top down.<br><br> "I hope you like freckles on a girl," Viv said. She was a redhead. "Dino will turn the color of mahogany in about an hour, and I try to keep up."<br><br> Stone followed the directions in the envelope; their landmark was a strip club called Bare Assets.<br><br> "Sounds like a nice neighborhood," Viv said.<br><br> "Can we have drinks there tonight?" Dino asked.<br><br> "If we do, it will be the only sex you'll get on this trip," Viv replied.<br><br> "They don't have sex there, just looking," Dino protested.<br><br> "I'm aware of that, and it's all you'll get. How many bedrooms are there, Stone?"<br><br> "Four, I'm told."<br><br> "Then you'll have two to choose from, Dino."<br><br> "Here's a thought," Dino said, "let's stay home and grill some steaks."<br><br> "Good idea," Viv replied.<br><br> The house was on a narrow lane between Truman Avenue and the island's cemetery. It had a bricked driveway and a garage and a carport, housing a golf cart, and Stone pulled into the garage. They got out and toured the house.<br><br> There was a book-lined study, next to an outdoor courtyard, followed by a dining room, a living room, and another, larger courtyard bordered by a koi pond, and beyond that there was a spa and a sunken swimming pool, all of it surrounded by jungle-like vegetation and flowers.<br><br> "Stone," Viv said, "this is spectacular!"<br><br> "We haven't seen the guest rooms and the kitchen," Stone said, consulting the note, "and there's a bar/video room. Oh, and that little house over there is the master suite, and we have an outdoor kitchen, bar, dining room, and living room, as well as the indoor ones." He pointed out everything. "From what it says here, I think you two will want the first guest room." They looked at it and approved. The kitchen was next. "Laundry room off the kitchen, in case Dino wants to rinse out his underthings." The next room contained a fully stocked bar and a very large flat-screen TV. They went back to the car, got their luggage, and settled in. "Drinks in half an hour," Stone said. "Outdoor bar."<br><br> Stone checked out the master suite and found a bedroom, dressing room, and a bath with a large tub. He found a TV remote control on the bedside table, but no set. He pressed the on button and a flat-screen TV rose from a cabinet and filled the wall at the foot of the bed. He could watch the Sunday political shows from there.<br><br> Everybody met in the outdoor living room, which was covered with an awning, in case of showers. There was no rain, and Stone tended bar, also making a couple of bottles of vodka gimlets and putting them in the freezer. In the process he found steaks and groceries in the outdoor kitchen fridge.<br><br> "I could live here," Viv said, settling into a sofa with a gimlet.<br><br> "If only it were in New York City," Dino responded, "on top of a tall building, maybe."<br><br> "Oh," Stone said, "there's a little house next to the back door that used to be free-standing, but a previous owner moved it over, bolted it to the main house, and made room for the driveway. A caretaker lives there. He keeps the place running and feeds the koi."<br><br> As if on cue a large, well-built man appeared and introduced himself as George. "Let me know if you need help with the electronics or anything else," he said, then he declined a drink, excused himself, and returned to his little house.<br><br> "There'll be a housekeeper, too, tomorrow morning." Stone looked at another sheet of paper. "The property was originally three small houses on three lots. Somebody bought them all and made them into the property you see now."<br><br> "Smart move," Dino said. "And you're playing golf tomorrow?"<br><br> "Arthur hustled me into playing in his tournament, and I haven't touched a club for more than a year."<br><br> "Then you'll lose," Dino pointed out.<br><br> "I think that's what Arthur has in mind," Stone replied.<br><br> "Oh," Viv said suddenly, putting a hand to a cheek.<br><br> "What?" Stone asked.<br><br> "I just had a premonition."<br><br> "A premonition of what?"<br><br> "I don't know, but something bad."<br><br> Dino waved an arm. "Bad? What bad could happen here?"<br><br> "As Fats Waller used to say, 'One never knows, do one?'"<br><br> 2<br><br> Stone was up early and found a housekeeper cleaning up their dishes and the grill from the night before. She introduced herself as Anna, then went back to work.<br><br> When she was done with the kitchen, Stone scrambled himself some eggs, microwaved some bacon, and toasted a Wolferman's English muffin, the sourdough flavor he liked. Joan, his secretary, had briefed somebody well.<br><br> He left Dino and Viv to sleep as late as they liked, then he recorded the Sunday political shows on the DVR, got the golf invitation from his briefcase, and followed the directions to the golf club. Somebody took his clubs from the trunk and carried them to the practice tee, and Arthur Steele greeted him there, his nose already sunburned.<br><br> "You'll be in my foursome with Arthur Junior and Meg Harmon, both new board members," Arthur said.<br><br> "I'd better hit a few to find out if I still can," Stone said.<br><br> He teed up a ball and made a big swing with his driver, then watched it slice fifty yards into a swamp. "Nothing's changed," he muttered, and he hit a bucket of balls, working on his swing until it began to straighten out a little.<br><br> Arthur Jr. was a clone of his old man, and Meg Harmon was a thirty-five-ish blonde, slim and fit-looking. She, Stone knew, had started a Silicon Valley software company in her early twenties and had recently sold it to a syndicate, with the Steele Group as a partner, for $1.5 billion. She teed up, and her drive went straight for better than two hundred yards. Arthur Jr. was next, and he drove about the same distance, but hooked it into the rough, muttering under his breath. Big Arthur hit one straight for two hundred and fifty yards.<br><br> "You've been practicing, Arthur," Stone said. "That's cheating." He teed up and sliced into the rough, but he was long and he still had a shot to the green, if his lie was good.<br><br> They were walking back to their carts when Stone heard a single crack, and he immediately thought: rifle! A man in the next foursome, waiting to tee off, made a loud noise and was knocked down.<br><br> "Everybody on the ground!" Stone shouted as he ran to the man, who had a bleeding shoulder wound. Stone looked around him and from the way the man had fallen, thought the shot had come from a swampy area to his right. He heard a vehicle door slam and gravel spraying beyond the trees. "From over there," he said, getting to his feet.<br><br> A club employee came running up. "Call nine-one-one," Stone said, "and tell them a man's down with a gunshot wound. Ask for an ambulance and the police."<br><br> Arthur walked over, dusting himself off. "That's Al Harris," he said, nodding at the man on the ground. He knelt. "How are you feeling, Al?" He got a grunt for an answer. "Hang on, help is on the way."<br><br> Stone looked around him at everyone's position. From where people had been standing when he heard the shot, he calculated that the shooter could have been aiming at Meg or Arthur, and with a miss, Al Harris had caught the stray bullet. It could, Stone thought, also have been aimed at himself.<br><br> The ambulance arrived first, the hospital being nearby, and two detectives were next by a couple of minutes. Stone greeted them and introduced himself, then he told them his theory of where the shot had come from and where it had been aimed.<br><br> "Are you a police officer?" the older of the two men asked.<br><br> "Retired detective," Stone replied. "I worked homicide."<br><br> "I'm Harry Kaufelt," the man replied. "This is my partner, Moe Cramer. We work anything that comes up. Did you see the shooter or his vehicle?"<br><br> "No, but from the sound of the door slamming and the engine, I think it could have been a pickup truck."<br><br> Harry got on his radio and reported. "Look for a pickup with a rifle rack. Yeah, yeah, I know, lots of those around. He could be headed north on U.S. 1. Let the sheriff know."<br><br> The EMTs were loading Al Harris into their vehicle, and one of them came over to Harry. "He's in shock," the man said.<br><br> "Get him taken care of," Harry said. "We'll talk to him later." Then he spoke to Stone again. "And you figure either you or the lady or the gentleman there could have been the target?"<br><br> "He only needed a gust of breeze or a jiggle of something to miss one of us and hit Mr. Harris."<br><br> "Well, Mr. Barrington . . ."<br><br> "Stone, please."<br><br> "Well, Stone, we're going to follow your lead on this, because we don't have one ourselves. Moe, you go talk to the other two, and I'll grill Stone, here."<br><br> "What would you like to know?" Stone asked.<br><br> "You all look as though you're out-of-towners," Harry said. "Where you from?"<br><br> "Mr. Steele and I are New Yorkers. The lady is from the West Coast, south of San Francisco somewhere."<br><br> "And what brought you all down here?"<br><br> "All the people playing are directors of the Steele Group, an insurance company. Mr. Steele is the chairman and CEO. The fellow next to the cart is Arthur Steele Junior."<br><br> "You have any reason to think that somebody down here might hold a grudge against any of you?"<br><br> "I've visited Key West a few times, but I don't know a lot of people. I've done some business with an attorney named Jack Spottswood."<br><br> "Him, we know, and his family. You haven't screwed any of them on some business deal, have you, Stone?"<br><br> "No, and if I had, I don't think the Spottswoods would react this way. They're nice people to do business with. And, for what it's worth, I don't think this is local."<br><br> "Oh? You think a professional is involved?"<br><br> "Are you aware of any contract killers living on your turf?"<br><br> "Nope. Our killers are usually drunk or mad at an ex-wife or girlfriend."<br><br> "Then that leaves a pro, doesn't it?"<br><br> "You may have a point."<br><br> "And a pro is going to be a lot harder to catch," Stone said. "He'll have an escape route all planned. You've already covered U.S. 1-that leaves the airport, doesn't it?"<br><br> "First call I made, when we got here," Harry said.<br><br> "Look for a couple," Stone suggested.<br><br> "Why's that?"<br><br> "Because the shooter would want to blend in, and he knows you'll be looking for a man traveling alone."<br><br> "'Scuse me." Harry got on the radio. "Thanks, Stone, that's a nice insight. Not that I wouldn't have thought of it myself, a couple of hours after they flew out of here. Any other thoughts?"<br><br> "I'd check the car rental agencies at the airport, too. I doubt if he took a cab out here."<br><br> "I doubt if he rented a pickup truck, too," Harry said, "since nobody rents pickups. A van, maybe."<br><br> "He's not getting on a plane with a rifle," Stone said.

Through her sensitivity and deep understanding of the subject, Annemarie Schimmel, an eminent scholar of Eastern religions, draws the reader into the mood, the vision, the way of the Sufi in a manner that adds an essential ingredient to her analysis of the history of Sufism.<br><br>After exploring the origins of the mystical movement in the meditations of orthodox Muslims on the Koran and the prophetic tradition, the author then discusses the development of its different stages, including classical voluntarism and postclassical theosophical mystical trends. Particular emphasis is placed on spiritual education, the different ways of leading the mystic toward the existential realization of the profound mystery of the profession of faith that "there is no deity but God." Sufi psychology and Sufi orders and fraternities are comprehensively explored.<br><br>Through an examination of mystical anthropology, which culminates in the veneration of the prophet and the saints, the questions of free will and predestination, of good and evil, are implied. The main burden of the text, however, is Sufism as reflected in Islamic poetry, and Professor Schimmel examines the various aspects of mystical poetry in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Sindhi, Panjabi, and Pashto. The author skillfully demonstrates how Sufi ideals permeated the whole fabric of Muslim life, providing the average Muslim -- villager or intellectual -- with the virtues of perfect trust in God and the loving surrender to God's will.<br><br>Professor Schimmel's long acquaintance with Turkey, Iran, and the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent provides a unique emphasis to the study, and the author's personal knowledge of Sufi practice in these regions lends a contemporary relevance to her work.<br><br></p><p>Thirty-five years after its original publication, this book still stands as the most valuable introduction to Sufism, the main form of Islamic mysticism. This edition brings to a new generation of readers Annemarie Schimmel&#39;s historical treatment of the transnational phenomenon of Sufism, from its beginnings through the nineteenth century. In the foreword, Carl Ernst comments on the continuing vitality of Schimmel&#39;s book and the advances in the study of Sufism since the work first appeared.Annemarie Schimmel (1922-2003) was a renowned German scholar of Islam and author of eighty books, including <i>And Muhammad Is His Messenger: The Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety</i> and <i>A Two-Colored Brocade: The Imagery of Persian Poetry</i>.</p><h2>The Human Magnet Syndrome: Why We Love People Who Hurt Us</h2><p>Since the dawn of civilization, men and women have been magnetically and irresistibly drawn together into romantic relationships, not so much by what they see, feel and think, but more by invisible forces.

Set some time in the future, after a human-made bacteria destroyed the modern world, the trilogy tells of new cities established and tightly controlled through brainwashing and a series of operations leading to a compliant society. Tally Youngblood, the 16-year-old protagonist, learns in the first two books that free will and truth are more important than a false sense of security. In <i>Specials</i>, she has become an elite fighting machine, fully enhanced with nanotechnology and super-fast reflexes, and made to work as a Special Circumstances agent for the nameless city that she fled. As in the first two books, much of the story takes place with characters whizzing through the air on hoverboards, but Tally and her friends are in for some harsh realities here. Readers who enjoyed <i>Uglies</i> and <i>Pretties</i> (both S &amp; S, 2005) will not want to miss <i>Specials</i>, but those who have not read those books will not understand much of what is happening. Westerfeld's themes include vanity, environmental conservation, Utopian idealism, fascism, violence, and love.

The story is surprising, controversial, and exciting as only a long-lost history can be when it is at last recovered.In The Jesus Dynasty, biblical scholar James Tabor brings us closer than ever to the historical Jesus. Jesus, as we know, was the son of Mary, a young woman who became pregnant before her marriage to a man named Joseph. The gospels tell us that Jesus had four brothers and two sisters, all of whom probably had a different father than his. He joined a messianic movement begun by his relative John the Baptizer, whom he regarded as his teacher and a great prophet. John and Jesus together filled the roles of the Two Messiahs who were expected at the time: John, as a priestly descendant of Aaron, and Jesus, as a royal descendant of David. Together they preached the coming of the Kingdom of God. Theirs was an apocalyptic movement that expected God to establish his kingdom on earth, as described by the Prophets. The Two Messiahs lived in a time of turmoil as the historical land of Israel was dominated by the powerful Roman Empire. Fierce Jewish rebellions against Rome occurred during Jesus&#39; lifetime. John and Jesus preached adherence to the Torah, or the Jewish Law. But their mission was changed dramatically when John was arrested and then killed. After a period of uncertainty, Jesus began preaching anew in Galilee and challenged the Roman authorities and their Jewish collaborators in Jerusalem. He appointed a Council of Twelve to rule over the twelve tribes of Israel, and among the Twelve he included his four brothers. After Jesus was crucified by the Romans, his brother James -- the &#34;Beloved Disciple&#34; -- took over leadership of the Jesus dynasty. James, like John and Jesus before him, saw himself as a faithful Jew. None of them believed that their movement was a new religion. It was Paul who transformed Jesus and his message through his ministry to the Gentiles. Breaking with James and the followers of Jesus in Jerusalem, Paul preached a message based on his own revelations, which would become Christianity. Jesus became a figure whose humanity was obscured; John became merely a forerunner of Jesus; and James and the others were all but forgotten. James Tabor has studied the earliest surviving documents of Christianity for more than thirty years and has participated in important archaeological excavations in Israel. Drawing on this background, Tabor reconstructs for us the movement that sought the spiritual, social, and political redemption of the Jews, a movement led by one family. The Jesus Dynasty offers an alternative version of Christian origins, one that takes us closer than ever to Jesus and his family and followers. This is a book that will change our understanding of one of the most crucial moments in history.</p><p><b>James D. Tabor</b> is chair of the department of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He holds a PhD in biblical studies and is an expert on Christian origins. He is the author of several books, among them <i>The Jesus Dynasty.</i> Visit him online at JamesTabor.com.Startling claims in nonfiction works about Jesus and early Christianity are hardly new (hello, <i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</i>), but Tabor, an academic and archaeologist, makes a solid case for the dynastic aspects of the Jesus movement and the importance of James the Just, Jesus' brother, during the period when the early church was forming. That said, the structure of the book seems scattered. Tabor begins with several exciting archaeological finds with which he was involved, including the discovery of a cave that might have been used by John the Baptist and the very recent discovery of a tomb with ossuaries that could be linked to Jesus' family members. This fascinating narrative hooks readers but doesn't quite meld with the rest of the book. Another problem is his emphasis on the genealogies of Jesus presented in Matthew and Luke, which are discounted by many scholars. Yet Tabor dares to go where few authors do: he takes on the subjects of Jesus' earthly paternity (including the case for a Roman father), his relationship to John the Baptist as partner rather than forerunner, and Jesus' expectations for his movement (as opposed to the direction in which it was taken by Paul). This breaks new ground on the journey to find the historical Jesus, and it is certain to prompt much discussion--and not a little controversy. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the author of The Thing That Bothered Farmer Brown.</p><p>It's springtime, and Farmer Brown is shearing his sheep: "Clip-clip, buzz-buzz, / He took their wool and left them fuzz." Naked, the pink-cheeked sheep begin to shiver as the temperature drops. They watch in dismay when Farmer Brown gathers up the bags of wool to deliver to Mr. Greene, who cleans and cards it. "'BAAA!' they cried. 'We want it back!'" But their bleating is to no avail. Farmer Brown continues on his rounds, visiting the yarn spinner and the dyer before he finally realizes that his poor lambs are frigidly following him. He scurries back to his farm and sets to work--knitting each one a bright, colorful sweater!<p> The third in the Farmer Brown series, after <i>Farmer Brown Goes Round and Round</i> and <i>The Thing That Bothered Farmer Brown</i>, this "yarn about wool" is as charmingly silly as its predecessors. Children can learn about the process of turning wool into the yarn that becomes the sweaters on their backs, while sympathizing with the somewhat ineffective sheep who must become all tangled up in yarn before clueless Farmer Brown catches on to their plight. However, never let it be said that Farmer Brown doesn't have a heart. His magnanimous solution to the sheep's situation teaches a perfectly palatable lesson in thoughtfulness. Nadine Bernard Westcott's stubbly-chinned Farmer Brown and rosy-bottomed sheep are positively huggable.

No one doubts that he is and should be a Herald, but he is afraid that his mere presence is going to incite more danger right in the heart of Valdemar. The heads of the Collegia are afraid that coming back to his known haunt is going to give him less protection than if he went into hiding. Everyone decides that going elsewhere is the solution for now. So since he is going elsewhere--why not return to the place he was found in the first place and look for clues? And those who are closest to him, and might provide secondary targets, are going along. With Herald Jadrek, Herald Kylan (the Weaponsmaster&#39;s chosen successor), and his friends Bear, Lena, and Amily, they head for the Bastion, the hidden spot in the hills that had once been the headquarters of a powerful band of raiders that had held him and his parents prisoner.

And underneath Mags, the solid, steady warmth of his Companion, jogging steadily toward those walls, taking him back to the only place he could even think of as home. By all rights, Mags should have been half out of his mind with joy to see the walls of Haven in the distance, but all he could muster was relief.</p><p>Partly, that was due to exhaustion. After all, a person doesn&#x2019;t get kidnapped, drugged, escape, trek alone and with�out any real resources across a foreign wilderness, get caught again, get drugged <i>again, </i>and fight his way free without being exhausted by it. He&#x2019;d gotten some rest on the journey back; his Herald and Healer escorts had been very careful to see that the trip had been taken at a slow pace when Mags showed no evidence that he was in a fret to be home. But exhaustion could be mental as well as physical, and he was suffering from both. His sleep was . . . not good. He woke a dozen times in the night, and his dreams were full of strange images, people he didn&#x2019;t know, a life he had never imagined before all this. He knew what they were from, of course: the &#x201c;memories&#x201d; that his captors had forced into his head. And none of these so-called &#x201c;memories&#x201d; raised even a little interest in him. If any�thing, he would have liked to be rid of them. They were disturbing on a multitude of levels.</p><p>Dallen, his Companion, had been uncharacteristically quiet for the entire journey back to Haven. He was always a steady�ing presence, but he just hadn&#x2019;t said much that wasn&#x2019;t neces�sary. Not that the Companion was withholding himself in any way! On the contrary, it was a great relief to Mags to feel Dallen as a bulwark in the back of his mind when he woke in the night. And it wasn&#x2019;t a disapproving sort of quiet, more the introspective sort.</p><p>When Mags had finally asked him what was going on, just this morning, he&#x2019;d gotten a somewhat surprising answer. At least, it wasn&#x2019;t anything that Mags would have guessed.</p><p><i>:I&#x2019;m examining those&#x2014; well, I suppose they are &#x201c;memories&#x201d;&#x2014; that you got.: </i>And that was all Dallen would say. So those memories . . . well, Mags supposed it was just as well <i>someone </i>was looking through them. It was the very last thing that <i>he </i>wanted to do.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time that Dallen had gone rummaging through Mags&#x2019; head, and Mags certainly didn&#x2019;t mind, but it was the first time that the things Dallen had examined weren&#x2019;t exactly events that Mags himself had lived through.</p><p><i>I wonder what he&#x2019;s made of all of that . . . </i>He&#x2019;d probably shared it with other Companions at this point; it would be foolish not to. The men who had shoved those things into Mags&#x2019; skull had tried multiple times to destroy the heart of Valdemar&#x2014; first by killing the King, then by destroying the Companions, then by kidnapping the daughter of the King&#x2019;s Own Herald, Mags&#x2019; sweetheart, Amily. If anything could be learned by going through all those thoughts, Mags would let a hundred Companions rummage through them.</p><p><i>:So?: </i>he asked, as they rode down into a valley and lost sight of the city for the moment. <i>:Have you learned anything?: </i></p><p>Dallen made a sort of muttering noise, and Mags got the definite impression that he was not at all happy. A moment later, the Companion&#x2019;s answer explained why. <i>:Not very en�lightening as to the origin of your pursuers. I suppose I would have to say &#x201c;your countrymen&#x201d;&#x2014; </i></p><p><i>:Not mine!: </i>Mags objected, so strongly that Dallen&#x2019;s head jerked up, and the Companion turned to stare at him with one startled blue eye. <i>:Mebbe I got the same blood, but I ain&#x2019;t the same sorta person as they are! Valdemar&#x2019;s my home!: </i>No mat�ter what those fiends had said, if there was one thing he was sure of, it was this&#x2014; he had nothing whatsoever in common with a clan full of assassins who took whatever contract paid most, regardless of how heinous it was.</p><p><i>: . . . I apologize, Chosen,: </i>Dallen said contritely&#x2014; and im�mediately. <i>:I should never have put it that way. Well. There is a lot you don&#x2019;t really remember of what they poured into you, and I think that&#x2019;s just as well. I can get at it with some work and share it back with you, but, honestly, it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be particularly useful. It&#x2019;s mostly about training, clan life, the clan hierarchy, and the bonding that those awful talismans of theirs creates. There&#x2019;s nothing there that I can look at and say, &#x201c;Aha! That&#x2019;s where they come from!&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t recognize the language, even. Rolan doesn&#x2019;t.: </i></p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time that Dallen had shared things at a great distance with Rolan; Mags&#x2019; Companion seemed to have an extraordinarily long &#x201c;reach&#x201d; when it came to Mindspeak�ing. And that gave Mags some comfort. Rolan knew . . . a lot. He&#x2019;d been the Companion to the last three King&#x2019;s Own Her�alds, and as a Grove-Born, Mags had every reason to sup�pose that he had access to a wealth of information no other creature&#x2014; except maybe a few gray old scholars&#x2014; had ever seen.</p><p><i>:While I&#x2019;ve heard of drugs that repress Mindspeaking, I&#x2019;ve never heard of drugs that open you up to memories like that. The talisman they used . . . that seemed to be where those memories came from. Something of that sort is completely new to me and to Rolan as well.: </i></p><p>Dallen settled himself back down, as Mags brooded on what he&#x2019;d said.</p><p><i>:Was there anythin&#x2019; at all that was useful?: </i>he finally asked.</p><p><i>:Hints. I wish there had been more of their life outside of their training. Or more of their more&#x2014; soteric training. Spy work. There were hints of things that could have been enor�mously useful to you in the path that Nikolas is mapping out for you. The techniques and tricks of an assassin are useful for a lot more than just killing people.: </i></p><p>It was too bad that Dallen had not managed to glean any�thing more useful, and yet Mags was just as glad he wasn&#x2019;t going to have to re-experience those memories for the sake of learning . . . spycraft. Surely Nikolas could teach him every�thing he would ever possibly need to know. Mags would just as soon not think too hard about what had been stuffed into his head. The best of it was unpleasant, and the worst made his skin crawl. He was just glad that it was all&#x2014; secondhand, as it were. Something that didn&#x2019;t <i>feel </i>as if he had done it.</p><p>And he was just as glad that his parents had escaped that poisonous environment. He didn&#x2019;t like to think what he would be like if he&#x2019;d been raised that way, with every waking mo�ment in earnest competition with other killers. Being a mine-slave had been bad enough; he still was not sure why it hadn&#x2019;t turned him hard and cruel. But the training that his blood kin went through . . . that was worse. It was <i>meant </i>to turn some�one hard and cruel. It was meant to turn someone into a ruth�less killer who would not hesitate to murder a babe in its mother&#x2019;s arms.</p><p>They rode up the slope, and now, again, above the farm fields and meadows that surrounded it, was Haven, close enough to make out people on the road leading in, the low Hill on which the Palace and the Collegia stood rising slightly above the rest of the city, secure behind their stone walls. And farther out, the city walls built of the same mellow stone. Not that the city needed walls anymore; evidence of that lay in the sprawl of city streets that spread out untidily outside them. The walls themselves were not even manned these days, ex�cept as a place for the City Guard to use as an easy path for patrolling, and a vantage point for looking down over the streets below. No enemy had come far enough into Valdemar to put the capital under siege in twenty generations or more. Only on the Borders did cities need to huddle inside their walls&#x2014; and really, not even on all the Borders. Mostly the one with Karse, although there were places in the north and west where small, organized troops of bandits were enough of a threat that no one wanted to build outside a defensive wall.</p><p>Spreading out over what was ordinarily a quiet stretch of common land between the city and the river was a second city of tents and canvas booths, and ever since the city had come into view, traffic on the road had been growing thicker. This was a reminder, not that Mags needed one, of how long he&#x2019;d been gone from Haven. He had been stolen away in early au�tumn. It was now almost winter. This was the Haven Harvest Fair, the last Harvest Fair in Valdemar for the year. Those mer�chants and peddlers disinclined to travel in the winter de�scended on the capital for one last spate of commerce before settling back into their shops and workshops for the winter months. Farmers brought their stock and their produce for merchants to store and sell all winter long. There was a Hiring Fair in one corner, a Horse Market in another. And, of course, where there was a Fair there were always entertainers. With all the other Harvest Fairs over, every traveling player and musician, every roving acrobat and tumbler, every single per�son who made his living on the road supplying amusement, all converged on Haven for the biggest Fair of the season.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the only fair, of course; there were four huge ones, one for each season, plus various other specialty fairs. But this was the biggest of them all. There would be another enor�mous Fair at Midwinter, but it would be only half the size of this one, if that; it would depend entirely on the weather. There would be no Hiring Fair at Midwinter as all seasonal hiring was done at the Spring and Harvest Fairs, and any en�tertainer who had any sort of venue for regular income would be sticking to it and not venturing to cross the country in the hard months of bitter cold.</p><p>Mags thought of the Midwinter Fair with much more fond�ness than the Harvest Fair&#x2014; even though the Harvest Fair was generally the favorite of all the other Trainees. It had been at Mags&#x2019; first Midwinter Fair, ever, that he had met Master Soren, whose friendship had led to so much&#x2014; including meeting Amily.</p><p>At the thought of Amily, he felt his throat closing; not even exhaustion could keep him from longing for her the way a starving man longs for meat. All of his doubts about whether or not he was in love with her had somehow vanished in those weeks he had been in captivity. If he had anything to say about it, he was never going to be separated from her again.</p><p><i>:I&#x2019;d be jealous if she weren&#x2019;t worth every bit of your regard,: </i>Dallen said lightly, and teasingly. <i>:And if I weren&#x2019;t certain she feels the same about you.: </i></p><p><i>:Quiet, horse,: </i>he managed, with real humor. <i>:Do I get jeal�ous of all the mares you chase?: </i></p><p><i>:And catch!: </i>Dallen replied archly, and he curved his neck and flagged his tail to prove how handsome he was. <i>:Even Rolan can&#x2019;t keep up with me. I am a legend among the mares, I will have you know.: </i>Mags chuckled and felt his spirits start to rise, albeit sluggishly.</p><p>It could not possibly have been a more perfect day for a homecoming. The air was just cold enough to still be pleasant as long as you were under a good wool cloak, the sky sported only a handful of fluffy white clouds. The air was rich with the scent of woodsmoke, fallen leaves, and the last hay crop dry�ing in the fields. Virtually everyone on the road was in a high state of cheer. And how not? From everything that Mags knew, it had been a good and fruitful year, the harvests especially bountiful. Even if the winter was terrible, there was more than enough to sustain the entire Kingdom through it.</p><p>The crowds gave way to the easily identifiable three Her�alds in their white uniforms who rode at the front of the little group, the remains of the troop of Guardsmen and Heralds that had met Mags and Dallen at the Karsite Border. There were the three Heralds, a Healer, and Mags now, which was a much more manageable number than the original rescue party. They&#x2019;d been able to spend the nights in comfortable inns rather than tents.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t surprising that people parted to let them pass. Mags might be in the Grays of a Trainee rather than the Whites of a Herald, but his Companion marked him as one of the Chosen. And a Healer&#x2019;s Greens always got respect, no matter what he was riding on.</p><p>Mags must have seemed to be emerging from deep thought, for the Healer perked up and gave him a look of inquiry, which Mags answered with a nod. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to finally meeting your friend Bear,&#x201d; the Healer said cheerfully, urging his mule up beside Dallen. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s quite the genius with herbs, and I can learn a lot from him.&#x201d;</p><p>That made one of the Heralds turn around in his saddle to stare a little. &#x201c;But Raynard, you have a Gift!&#x201d; Herald Farnten exclaimed. &#x201c;Why on earth would you need <i>herbs?&#x201d; </i></p><p>&#x201c;Because if I can get the same result using herbs as I can using my Gift, I am going to use herbs,&#x201d; the Healer said pa�tiently, as if he had been forced to make this same explanation far too many times in the past. &#x201c;That way I save my energy for someone I <i>can&#x2019;t </i>dose with herbs. You have Fetching Gift. Do you use it to get an apple from a bowl across the room?&#x201d;</p><p>The Herald chewed his lip a moment. &#x201c;You have a good point,&#x201d; Herald Farnten replied, nodding. &#x201c;I never thought of it that way. I just think of Healers as . . .&#x201d; Then he shrugged. &#x201c;Obviously, I&#x2019;m an idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so much an idiot as the first part . . . you <i>didn&#x2019;t think,</i>&#x201d; Raynard chided. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t feel bad; that&#x2019;s all too common, alas. I wish it weren&#x2019;t. People like Bear would get a lot more respect.&#x201d;</p><p>It cheered Mags immensely to hear his friend spoken of with such respect by a Healer who knew him only by reputation. Certainly poor Bear got none of that from his own family, who felt that a Healer without a Gift was no kind of Healer at all.</p><p>This engendered a lively discussion between Raynard and Farnten, which Mags stayed out of. They generally agreed with each other, but they seemed to enjoy these debates that were not quite arguments. He&#x2019;d learned that much on the jour�ney back up from the South. He supposed just some people just enjoyed arguing for the sake of it and somehow managed to not turn an argument into an excuse for an actual fight.</p><p><i>:Yes, well, civility is an art form not practiced nearly enough,: </i>Dallen observed. <i>:By the way, are you going to be civil enough to buy me a pocket pie on the way through the Fair?: </i></p><p><i>:I swear I would, but you know I haven&#x2019;t so much as a bent pin in my pockets,: </i>he apologized. <i>:I promise I&#x2019;ll beg the cooks for some for you when we get up to the Collegium. You deserve a thousand pocket pies for rescuing me.: </i></p><p><i>:I&#x2019;m pleased to see you properly value my courage.: </i>There was a chuckle under Dallen&#x2019;s mind-voice. <i>:Not to mention my astonishing good looks and sparkling personality.: </i></p><p>Mags found himself grinning and felt his spirits lightening some. :You&#x2019;re almost as handsome as Raynard&#x2019;s mule. And a hundred times better as company.:</p><p>He got a snort for an answer.</p><p>The road had entered the Harvest Fair, and it appeared that on the right was the quarter devoted to food and entertain�ment, and on the left was that devoted to livestock. Cla...</p></p><h2>The Heavenly Table: A Novel</h2><p><b>From Donald Ray Pollock, author of the highly acclaimed <i>The Devil All the Time</i> and <i>Knockemstiff</i>, comes a dark, gritty, electrifying (and, disturbingly, weirdly funny) new novel that will solidify his place among the best contemporary American authors.</b> <br><br>It is 1917, in that sliver of border land that divides Georgia from Alabama. Dispossessed farmer Pearl Jewett ekes out a hardscrabble existence with his three young sons: Cane (the eldest; handsome; intelligent); Cob (short; heavy set; a bit slow); and Chimney (the youngest; thin; ill-tempered). Several hundred miles away in southern Ohio, a farmer by the name of Ellsworth Fiddler lives with his son, Eddie, and his wife, Eula. After Ellsworth is swindled out of his family's entire fortune, his life is put on a surprising, unforgettable, and violent trajectory that will directly lead him to cross paths with the Jewetts. No good can come of it. Or can it?<br><br>In the gothic tradition of Flannery O'Connor and Cormac McCarthy with a healthy dose of cinematic violence reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah, Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers, the Jewetts and the Fiddlers will find their lives colliding in increasingly dark and horrific ways, placing Donald Ray Pollock firmly in the company of the genre's literary masters.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2016:</strong> There&#x2019;s really nobody like Donald Ray Pollock. With a name that sounds like a serial killer&#x2019;s and style to match, he came to the writing game late, publishing the grimly funny and occasionally shocking collection, <em>Knockemstiff</em>, on the windward side of his 50th birthday. <em>The Devil All the Time</em>, another dark ramble through backwoods Ohio, followed, this time expanding his grimy gothic into a fully realized novel. And with his latest, Pollock is neither slowing down nor pulling back. <em>The Heavenly Table</em> splits the tale between two camps: On one side are Cane, Cobb, and Chimney, three brothers of varying dimness suddenly turned loose--at the death of their pious father--to fulfill their kindred potential for violence and larceny. On the other are Ellsworth and Eula Fiddler, increasingly desperate to maintain their farm after losing their "fortune" to a painfully obvious swindle. Suffice to say, Pollock winds up his doomed characters and sets them in motion in a pulpy, peripatetic trajectories in each other's direction. If you're the kind of reader who assesses a book by how well you like its characters, this book probably isn't for you; the best reason to read <em>The Heavenly Table</em> is to witness a writer constantly pushing the borders of imagination--and often propriety--while daring his readers to reassess their own.<em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em>DONALD RAY POLLOCK is the author of the novel <i>The Devil All the Time </i>and the story collection <i>Knockemstiff</i>, recipient of the 2009 PEN/Robert W.

Two years later, she captured headlines across the globe when she married James Graham Phelps Stokes, scion of one of the legendary 400 families of New York high society. Together, this unusual couple joined the burgeoning Socialist Party and, over the next dozen years, moved among the liveliest group of activists and dreamers this country has ever seen. Their friends and houseguests included Emma Goldman, Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, John Reed, Margaret Sanger, Jack London, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Rose stirred audiences to tears and led strikes of restaurant waiters and garment workers. She campaigned alongside the country&#x2019;s earliest feminists to publicly defy laws against distributing information about birth control, earning her notoriety as &#x201c;one of the dangerous influences of the country&#x201d; from President Woodrow Wilson. But in a way no one foresaw, her too-short life would end in the same abject poverty with which it began.<br><br> By a master of narrative nonfiction, <i>Rebel Cinderella</i> unearths the rich, overlooked life of a social justice campaigner who was truly ahead of her time.</p><p><p>ADAM HOCHSCHILD is the author of ten books.&nbsp;<i>King Leopold&#x2019;s Ghost</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, as was <i>To End All Wars.</i> His&nbsp;<i>Bury the Chains</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the National Book Award and won the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize and PEN USA Literary Award.

Said.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> George&#x2019;s mother is dead. <br> &nbsp;<br> What moral conundrum? George says.<br> &nbsp;<br> The passenger seat in the hire car is strange, being on the side the driver&#x2019;s seat is on at home. This must be a bit like driving is, except without the actual, you know, driving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay. You&#x2019;re an artist, her mother says.<br> &nbsp;<br> Am I? George says. Since when? And is that a moral conundrum?&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ha ha, her mother says. Humour me. Imagine it. You&#x2019;re an artist.<br> &nbsp;<br> This conversation is happening last May, when George&#x2019;s mother is still alive, obviously. She&#x2019;s been dead since September. Now it&#x2019;s January, to be more precise it&#x2019;s just past midnight on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, which means it has just become the year after the year in which George&#x2019;s mother died.<br> &nbsp;<br> George&#x2019;s father is out. It is better than him being at home, standing maudlin in the kitchen or going round the house switching things off and on. Henry is asleep. She just went in and checked on him; he was dead to the world, though not as dead as the word dead literally means when it means, you know, dead. <br> &nbsp;<br> This will be the first year her mother hasn&#x2019;t been alive since the year her mother was born. That is so obvious that it is stupid even to think it and yet so terrible that you can&#x2019;t not think it. Both at once.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway George is spending the first minutes of the new year looking up the lyrics of an old song. Let&#x2019;s Twist Again. Lyrics by Kal Mann. The words are pretty bad. Let&#x2019;s twist again like we did last summer. Let&#x2019;s twist again like we did last year. Then there&#x2019;s a really bad rhyme, a rhyme that isn&#x2019;t, properly speaking, even a rhyme. <br> &nbsp;<br> Do you remember when <br>Things were really hummin&#x2019;.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Hummin&#x2019; doesn&#x2019;t rhyme with summer, the line doesn&#x2019;t end in a question mark, and is it meant to mean, literally, do you remember that time when things smelt really bad?&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Then Let&#x2019;s twist again, twisting time is here. Or, as all the sites say, twistin&#x2019; time.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> At least they&#x2019;ve used an apostrophe, the George from before her mother died says.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> I do not give a fuck about whether some site on the internet attends to grammatical correctness, the George from after says.<br> &nbsp;<br> That before and after thing is about mourning, is what people keep saying. They keep talking about how grief has stages. There&#x2019;s some dispute about how many stages of grief there are. There are three, or five, or some people say seven.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s quite like the songwriter actually couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to think of words. Maybe he was in one of the three, five or seven stages of mourning too. Stage nine (or twenty three or a hundred and twenty three or ad infinitum, because nothing will ever not be like this again): in this stage you will no longer be bothered with whether songwords mean anything. In fact you will hate almost all songs.<br> &nbsp;<br> But George has to find a song to which you can do this specific dance.<br> &nbsp;<br> It being so apparently contradictory and meaningless is no doubt a bonus. It will be precisely why the song sold so many copies and was such a big deal at the time. People like things not to be too meaningful. <br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, I&#x2019;m imagining, George in the passenger seat last May in Italy says at exactly the same time as George at home in England the following January stares at the meaninglessness of the words of an old song. Outside the car window Italy unfurls round and over them so hot and yellow it looks like it&#x2019;s been sandblasted. In the back Henry snuffles lightly, his eyes closed, his mouth open. The band of the seatbelt is over his forehead because he is so small.<br> &nbsp;<br> You&#x2019;re an artist, her mother says, and you&#x2019;re working on a project with a lot of other artists. And everybody on the project is getting the same amount, salary-wise. But you believe that what you&#x2019;re doing is worth more than everyone on the project, including you, is getting paid. So you write a letter to the man who&#x2019;s commissioned the work and you ask him to give you more money than everyone else is getting. <br> &nbsp;<br> Am I worth more? George says. Am I better than the other artists?<br> &nbsp;<br> Does that matter? her mother says. Is that what matters? <br> &nbsp;<br> Is it me or is it the work that&#x2019;s worth more? George says.<br> &nbsp;<br> Good. Keep going, her mother says.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is this real? George says. Is it hypothetical? <br> &nbsp;<br> Does that matter? her mother says.</p><h2>The Principal Upanishads: Edited with Introduction, Text, Translation and Notes (English, Sanskrit and Sanskrit Edition)</h2><p>The Upanisads are ancient philosophical texts that form the basis of the Hindu religion. The Hindus believe that these ancient works reveal the truth of the ultimate reality, and the path to moksha , or salvation. There are more than 200 Upanishads. <br><br> Dr. Radhakrishnan wrote many books on Indian Philosophy to enlighten the people, especially the Westerners, on India s rich traditions and philosophy. The Principal Upanisads was first published by him in the year 1953. Here, he translates the meaning and the gist of the Upanisads in English, in order to make this knowledge easily accessible to the West. <br><br> In the preface to the book, Dr. Radhakrishnan points out the significance and the value of the Upanisads. Even if they seem insignificant or unimportant in the modern world, they still deserve to be studied as a memorial of India s past, and as the foundation of the lives and the beliefs of millions of people in the earlier ages. Dr. Radhakrishnan asks the readers not to judge these valuable philosophical texts based on modern standards, but to make an attempt to understand and appreciate them based on the values and the standards of the time when they were written, and were the most applicable. <br><br> To understand our traditions and to preserve our character and national being, Dr Radhakrishnan believes that it is essential to study and understand the Upanisads. The topics covered in the book include General Influence of the Upanisads, The Relation of the Upanisads to the Vedas, The Aranyakas and the Brahmanas, The Upanisads, Ultimate Reality: Atman Knowledge and Ignorance, Ethics, Karma and Rebirth, Religion, and The Individual Self. <br><br> This is followed by the Sanskrit Originals, and also the verse by verse commentaries and English translations of some of the main Upanisads. The book has 2 Appendices, which give the perspectives of Edmond Holmes and Rabindranath Tagore on the Upanisads. <br><br> Written by one of the most respected and influential Indian scholars, The Principal Upanisads, has been republished several times.</p><p>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second President of India, was born on 5th September, 1888. A great statesman and renowned scholar, he was also the first Vice President of the country. <br><br> His books include The Hindu View Of Life, An Idealist View Of Life, Indian Philosophy, Eastern Religions and Western Thought, The Dhammapada, and Recovery Of Faith. <br><br> Radhakrishnan completed his Master s in Philosophy from Madras Christian College. His distinguished teaching career started in 1918, with his appointment to the Madras Presidency College Department of Philosophy. He also taught at the University of Mysore, University of Calcutta, and delivered lectures at Oxford s Harris Manchester College. He was the Vice Chancellor of Andhra University and Banaras Hindu University. <br><br> Dr Radhakrishnan was als o the Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at Oxford University. He was a representative of UNESCO, a member of India s Constituent Assembly, and India s Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Dr Radhakrishnan was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954. He died in the year 1975.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>My First Five Husbands..And the Ones Who Got Away</h2><p>&#x201c;'You will do foolish things' said the great writer Colette, 'but do them with enthusiasm!' And that, my darlings, I have done! So put your feet up, relax, and let me take you on one woman's journey through the beguiling, bewildering wilderness of romantic encounters, replete with puppy love, Latin love, smoldering lust, stardust, obsession, high comedy, high camp, and all manner of peccadilloes and misadventures. A rollicking, madcap ride through the wide-open countryside of love. Just watch out for land mines.&#x201d; <br>--From <i>My First Five Husbands . . . And the Ones Who Got Away<br></i><br><br><b>People always ask me if I'm like Blanche. And I say, 'Well, Blanche was an oversexed, self-involved, man-crazy, vain Southern Belle from Atlanta -- and I'm not from Atlanta!&#x2019;&#x201d; -- Rue McClanahan<br></b><br>Who can forget Rue McClanahan as the sexy Southern vixen, Blanche Devereaux, on the Emmy-award winning series <i>The Golden Girls</i>? With her breezy sex appeal and sharp comedic timing, Rue infused her character with a sassy <i>joie de vivre</i> that captured the hearts of audiences around the world. Now, the actress behind the magic reveals her life in and out of the spotlight in a laugh-out-loud funny memoir about love, marriage, men, and getting older that is every bit as colorful as the characters she plays. <i><br></i><br>Raised in small-town Oklahoma in a house &#x201c;thirteen telephone poles past the standpipe north of town,&#x201d; Rue developed her two great passions&#x2014;theater and men&#x2014;at an early age. She arrived in New York City in 1957 with two-weeks worth of money in her pocket, hustled her way into a class with the legendary Uta Hagen, and began working her way up in the acting world against the vibrant, free-spirited backdrop of the sixties. That&#x2019;s when she met and married Husband #1&#x2014;a handsome rogue of an aspiring actor who quickly left her with a young son. Still, she was determined to make it on the stage and screen&#x2014;and in the years that followed, rose to the top of the entertainment world with a host of adventures (and husbands) along the way. <br><br>From her roles on Broadway opposite Dustin Hoffman and Brad Davis, to her first television appearances on <i>Maude</i> and <i>All in the Family</i>,<i> </i>to the <i>Golden Girls </i>era and beyond, <i>My First Five Husbands</i> is the irresistible story of one woman&#x2019;s quest to find herself. Now happily married to Husband #6, Rue is proof that many things can and do get better with age&#x2014;and that with tenacity, talent, and a little help from Saint Dymphna, even a small-town girl can make it big. <br><br>Told with Rue&#x2019;s saucy wit and Southern charm, <i>My First Five husbands</i> is a deliciously entertaining take on life and love from an irrepressible star.</p><p><p><b>Rue McClanahan </b>was born in Healdton, Oklahoma, and graduated cum laude in theater from the University of Tulsa. Most noted for her role as Blanche on <i>The Golden Girls, </i>McClanahan has had a number of well-known starring roles in television and on Broadway. In addition to her work as an actress, McClanahan speaks regularly for breast cancer awareness and prevention of cruelty toward animals. She lives in New York City with her husband, Morrow Wilson, and her cat, Bianca.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;<i>How the hell did we end up here?</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;Christopher Columbus<br>My mother, Rheua&#x2013;Nell, was five feet and one half inch tall. She always included that one half inch. (Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.) Bright and talented in music and dance, she won a Charleston contest when she was sixteen. Had she been younger, I suspect, my grandfather, Pee&#x2013;Paw, would&#x2019;ve soundly whipped her with his razor strop. He raised his family in a strict Southern Baptist tradition; no dancing allowed. Shortly thereafter, still sixteen, she graduated valedictorian of her high school class and went off to Dallas to study cosmetology to become a beauty operator. Four years later, she was working in Mrs. Rose&#x2019;s beauty parlor on Main Street in Healdton, Oklahoma, when she met my father, Bill, who had hurt his back in the construction trade and was managing a billiards parlor a few doors down. <br><br>Six weeks later, they married. Ten months after that&#x2014;February 21, 1934&#x2014;I was born. The doctor nicknamed me &#x201c;Frosty&#x201d; because I had a full head of white&#x2013;blond hair, but when Mother saw me, she burst into tears. I&#x2019;d been taken with forceps after she labored (at home, of course) for thirty&#x2013;some hours, so my head was elongated and blue and apparently quite alarming to behold. I soon rounded out and pinked up to her satisfaction, however. Mother thought I was adorable and took photos like they were going out of style. <br><br>When she was pregnant, Mother had been approached by Aunt Wenonah Sue, my father&#x2019;s sister, begging to let her name the baby. Mother acquiesced, but only if she could name Wenonah&#x2019;s firstborn, to which Wenonah agreed. Frankly, I wouldn&#x2019;t let anyone name my firstborn. But my mother was a sweet and compliant young lady of twenty, Wenonah&#x2019;s junior by a couple of years, and somewhat under the thrall of this enthusiastic and insistent sister&#x2013;in&#x2013;law. My father&#x2019;s name was William Edwin. So when, in the fullness of time, I was born, Wenonah brought forth her marvelous name: <i>Eddi</i>&#x2013;<i>Rue, </i>a little composite of both my parents&#x2019; names. <br><br>Everyone just loved it. It was so cute! It had a hyphen. <br><br>&#x201c;Eddi&#x2013;Rue,&#x201d; my aunt Nonie has been heard to say, &#x201c;I think you have one of the prettiest names in the family.&#x201d; <br><br>Then Wenonah Sue married a fine fellow named Earl and had a daughter whom Mother dubbed Earla Sue&#x2014;no hyphen&#x2014;who wisely dropped the &#x201c;Earla&#x201d; when she was fourteen. Because of the &#x201c;Eddi&#x201d;&#x2014; which people always misspelled &#x201c;Eddie&#x201d; like a boy&#x2014;I was sent a man&#x2019;s handkerchief as a high school graduation gift from Daube&#x2019;s Department Store, along with the other male graduates. I also received a draft notice, inviting me to come down for a physical exam. I&#x2019;ve always thought maybe I should&#x2019;ve gone for that physical. Some childhood friends still call me &#x201c;Eddi.&#x201d; People who knew me as a baby call me &#x201c;Frosty.&#x201d; My friend Lette called me &#x201c;Baby Roo,&#x201d; my friend Jim Whittle called me &#x201c;Rutabaga,&#x201d; Betty White calls me &#x201c;Roozie,&#x201d; and my friend Kathy Salomone calls me &#x201c;Rue-Rue.&#x201d; The staff at Sloan&#x2013;Kettering Cancer Center call me &#x201c;Mrs. Wilson.&#x201d; And my husband calls me &#x201c;Darling.&#x201d; I like them all. Each name brings forth its own era and memories. <br><br>When I was in my late twenties, I bought eight used dining room chairs for a dollar each (yes, a dollar!) and set about removing the old varnish. As I applied the varnish remover, a vivid visual memory flashed into my mind: I was almost eight months old, sidestepping along the front of the sofa, holding on for balance, looking up over my left shoulder at my mother and Aunt Irene standing in the doorway making vocal sounds. <br><br>&#x201c;Iddle bongingferd da wondy,&#x201d; said Mother. <br><br>&#x201c;Bid gerpa twack kelzenbluck,&#x201d; replied Aunt Irene. <br><br>&#x201c;Ferndock bandy,&#x201d; Mother replied. &#x201c;Critzputh.&#x201d; And they laughed. <br><br>I realized they were exchanging thoughts with those sounds. <i>Oh, </i>I thought, <i>I&#x2019;m brand new here. Soon, they</i>&#x2019;<i>ll teach me to do that, too. </i>What an exciting thought! <br><br>Smells are strong memory&#x2013;triggers. Mother and Irene must have been using varnish remover that day in 1934, and the odor of it in 1963 popped out this early memory, crystal clear. My next memory is of Christmas when I was ten months old: a circle of uncles and other adults winding up a little red rocket that chased me from one side of their circle to the other, everyone laughing. But I was truly terrified, running frantically from the noisy thing and wondering why they thought it was so funny. <br><br>Mother gave me my first perm when I was eleven months old, under one of those old stand&#x2013;up octopus&#x2013;armed permanent wave machines. Mother was movie&#x2013;struck, you see. She kept the beauty shop stocked with current movie magazines, was nuts about Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Shirley Temple, and wanted me to have a full head of bouncy sausage curls, just like <i>Little Miss Broadway</i>. And I never existed without a perm until I was well into my forties. <br><br>&#x201c;Why do you keep a perm in your hair?&#x201d; my beautician asked me one day. <br><br>&#x201c;Can you exist without one?&#x201d; I responded, utterly amazed. <br><br>This revolutionary concept had never occurred to me. Wouldn&#x2019;t my hair just flail about wildly? Like Albert Einstein&#x2019;s? I gave it a try, and from that day to this, I&#x2019;ve lived quite happily without a perm. And learned that I have a natural wave to boot. <br><br>Aunt Irene, my mother&#x2019;s seventeen&#x2013;year&#x2013;old sister, moved in to take care of me while Mother worked in the beauty parlor, but I wanted to be downstairs in the shop. It was lonely upstairs, and boring, and Irene was hot&#x2013;tempered and brusque, while Mother was jolly fun. It&#x2019;s hard to remember her without a smile. I was allowed to play in the shop from time to time, as long as I sat under the counters and didn&#x2019;t ask too many questions. It was fun under the counters. Legs coming and going, chatter, things happening. To help keep me quiet, I was allowed to nurse my bottle until I was over three. It was bolstered with Eagle brand, a thick, sweet canned milk, because I&#x2019;d been born a bit scrawny and, on doctor&#x2019;s orders, Mother was trying to fatten me up. She used to send me up the street to the five&#x2013;and&#x2013;ten store to buy my own rubber nipples. I remember standing at the cash register getting change. <br><br>Mother had also been taking me to the movies since I was a babe in arms, wearing PJs under my street clothes. One night as I sat in the row behind her, waiting for the picture to begin, I tapped on the back of her seat, saying, &#x201c;Mama?&#x201d; <br><br>She turned and said, &#x201c;Eddi&#x2013;Rue, you&#x2019;re too old now to call me &#x2018;Mama.&#x2019; From now on, call me &#x2018;Mother.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br><i><br>Ooooh</i>. I was so chagrined to be reprimanded in front of everyone, I wanted to crawl under my seat. I never called her Mama again. Mother and Bill expected me to behave like an adult, and I was dead set not to disappoint them. I never went through a rebellious period and was terribly stricken whenever I accidentally lost or broke something. They worked so hard for their money, and I knew this, though I don&#x2019;t recall being at all aware of the Depression. Mother had plenty of customers, we went to the movies every time we turned around, I had a new doll every Christmas, a new birthday dress every year, plus a birthday party. However, I do remember pinto beans every night for supper; I never ate a supper without pinto beans until I went to college, where I was astonished to learn that you didn&#x2019;t have to have them on the table. I&#x2019;d assumed it was some sort of rule. On the rare nights Mother was too tired to cook a meal, we had corn bread crumbled in a glass of sweet milk, which I considered a big treat. <br><br>But it was probably because of the Depression that my father had to go off to the oil fields to get construction work. He was called &#x201c;Bill&#x201d; by everyone, including me. (Just in case an old girlfriend showed up, he joked.) He left before I woke in the morning, came home long after I was asleep, and didn&#x2019;t toss me around like my uncles did. He wasn&#x2019;t a hugger. His mother, Fanny, was the only daughter in a family of four boys, forbidden to have a doll (her father even burned a corncob dolly her mother made her, the old buzzard) or to show physical affection. She, in turn, didn&#x2019;t hug her four children. Still, she made me an adorable new outfit for every birthday and taught me to sew on her big treadle sewing machine. She was a loving, kind person&#x2014;just not one for hugging. So my father never learned how, I guess. <br><br>One day when I was five, he came home from work earlier than usual. I was standing on the front porch as dusk settled over our neighborhood, and as Bill walked toward me, my arms and body ached so deeply for him to stop and hug me hello that my skin hurt. But he only said a weary, &#x201c;Hello, Frosty,&#x201d; and I said, &#x201c;Hi, Bill,&#x201d; as he trudged past me, leaving me feeling empty and alone. (Later, when I was in the ninth grade, I watched my friend Carol Ann Bristow hugging everybody and decided to learn to do it. It took courage the first few times, but I made it a habit. And it felt <i>good</i>! I&#x2019;m a staunch advocate of hugging to this day.) <br><br>Aunt Wenonah always told me my father was a brilliant man. <br><br>&#x201c;But strange,&#x201d; she always added. &#x201c;Not like the rest of us kids.&#x201d;<br><br>Yep. That he was. A dry and hilarious storyteller, Bill wrote a dark play during his senior year in high school, exposing some ugly truths about the people in Healdton. The principal made him burn it after one performa...</p><h2>Dark Side of the Light Chasers : Reclaiming Your Power, Creativity, Brilliance and Dreams</h2><p>In this enlightening guide, Debbie Ford explains that the dark side of our personality should not be hidden. By denying our dark side, we reject these aspects of our true natures rather than giving ourselves the freedom to live authentically. Here she shows that it is possible to acknowledge and accept our so-called weaknesses, proving that these qualities may be important, hidden strengths. For example, perhaps some &#39;selfishness&#39; can save us from exhaustion and resentment. Full of illuminating stories and practical exercises, Debbie Ford shows us how to reconcile our darker impulses and find the gifts they offer. Your life will be transformed when you unconceal, own, and embrace your shadow.</p><p>We know the shadow by many names: alter ego, lower self, the dark twin, repressed self, id. Carl Jung once said that the shadow "is the person you would rather not be." But even if you choose to hide your dark side, it will still cast a shadow, according to author Debbie Ford. Rather than reject the seemingly undesirable parts of ourselves, Ford offers advice on how to confront our shadows.

Have any of them given you a successful method for making profits and reducing risks? Is there even one such book that has proven reliable over the years? Alas, most investors would say &#34;no.&#34; That&#39;s because so few investment books are &#34;classic&#34; in the true sense: For years investors keep buying the book, and they keep using the method to make the most of their opportunities. Three decades years ago -- 1978 -- is one of the last times an investment book was written that is worthy of being called &#34;classic.&#34; One of the two men who authored that book was a 26 year-old market analyst working at Merrill Lynch&#39;s headquarters on Wall Street. The young man had earned a lot of attention in a short time by using a forecasting tool that almost no one had heard of. Yet his market forecasts were startlingly accurate: Robert Prechter was the young man&#39;s name, and he used a method called the &#34;Elliott Wave Principle.&#34; A. J. Frost was one of the few other financial professionals who used the Wave Principle. In a distinguished 20-year career, Frost had likewise made many astonishingly accurate forecasts. His colleagues regarded him as the consummate technical analyst. Frost and Prechter met in May of 1977 and became fast friends. Eighteen months later, they published Elliott Wave Principle - Key to Market Behavior. The Dow Industrials stood at 790. But the brash forecast in this new book called for a Great Bull Market. It became a runaway best seller. Three decades is enough time for investors to deem a book about an investment method as &#34;classic,&#34; and surely the jury is in on this one: Elliott Wave Principle is now published in seven languages, and continues to sell thousands of copies every year. In Europe, Asia and the Americas, literally millions of investors worldwide use or recognize the Elliott Wave method for profitable investing. Elliott Wave International is proud to present the 10th edition of this investment classic. It&#39;s designed to help the Elliott Wave novice and the veteran practitioner. It&#39;s time to consider what this definitive text offers you. Here&#39;s a sample of what you&#39;ll learn: The basic tenets of Wave Theory: You&#39;ll read simple explanations of the terms, and how to identify all 13 waves that can occur in the movement of stock market averages. The rules and guidelines of Wave analysis: You&#39;ll learn the basics of counting waves, how to recognize the &#34;right look&#34; of a wave, plus lots of simple steps for applying the rules. The scientific background of the Wave Principle: How you can see it in nature and the universe, in art and mathematics, even in the shape of the human body. Long-term waves: You&#39;ll see how the Wave Principle gives history greater meaning, from the fall of the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages into the financial upheavals of the 20th Century. Understanding these monumental trends will help you position yourself for long-term profit and protection. Stocks, commodities and gold: The Wave Principle is your guide to the movements of any financial market. Few pleasures can match the exhilaration you&#39;ll feel when a Wave Principle forecast has you in the market when it moves up, or takes you out just before it moves down. Obviously, Elliott Wave Principle - Key to Market Behavior is the perfect companion to Bob Prechter&#39;s Elliott Wave Theorist publication. The book is essential reading for you to receive the most from what the Theorist says every month -- in fact, all of EWI&#39;s publications continually reference this book.</p><p></p><h2>The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and Their Extinction</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s leading paleontologists presents revolutionary discoveries about how dinosaur brains worked, how their metabolism influenced their lives, and comments on dozens of other heretical ideas about dinosaur habits and habitats</p><p>Bakker is undoubtedly the controversial and exciting dinosaurologist of the day. His ideas of active, behaviorly complex, warm-blooded dinosaurs have shaken orthodox views and stimulated both public interest and renewed scientific research. In this book he reviews many of his well-known ideas about dinosaur physiology, feeding habits, running ability, taxonomy, and extinction, and offers tidbits on more minor details, e.g., whether dinosaurs had a gizzard. He writes in a colorful, even impassioned prose more akin to political rhetoric than analytic science. While this book lacks the breadth and balanced objectivity of David Norman's excellent The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs (Crescent Bks., 1985), it is nevertheless important and revolutionary.

And Ms. Stevermer is the author of several books for adults and a fantasy novel for young readers, <i>River Rats</i>. They both live in Minnesota.<br>February<br>~<br>&nbsp;<br>~&nbsp;24 FEBRUARY 1828<br>TANGLEFORD HALL, KENT<br>Dearest Kate,<br>&nbsp;It was splendid to see you and Thomas and your boys again this fortnight past. (And I still think that Baby Laurence is the image of his papa, even if he is still quite bald. In deference to Thomas&#x2019;s feelings, however, I shall not mention the resemblance again until little Laurence is old enough to have grown some hair.) My only regret is that we could not stay longer at Skeynes. You have turned it into such a comfortable home that I do not wonder at your reluctance to go up to London, though I do hope James and I can coax you all to visit Tangleford next summer, so that we may return your hospitality.<br>&nbsp;Two weeks was hardly enough time to catch up on all your doings of the past few months. I know James was as sorry to leave as I, and as for the children&#x2014; well, you saw how Baby Alexander cried when we left, and Diana and the twins all sulked for two days straight. (I had expected it of Diana, who is only four, after all, but I had hoped that at the age of nine, the twins would have grown out of such tricks. Apparently it takes longer than that.)<br>&nbsp;Speaking of the twins, I am afraid Arthur has confessed that he and Eleanor sneaked into Thomas&#x2019;s study on the last day of our visit. Eleanor has been suffering from a trifling ailment since we left&#x2014; no more than a bad cold, but Arthur was convinced that it must be the result of some dreadful magical protection they had triggered, and so he poured out the whole story to James and me the night after we arrived home. I do not know where he can have come by such a notion, but he was so earnest in his concern that both James and I had difficulty in keeping a sober expression. I promise you that we did so, however, as neither of us wishes to encourage him to undertake any similar adventures in the future. Poking about in a wizard&#x2019;s study is serious business.<br>&nbsp;The reason I mention it is that Thomas may need to readjust his warding spells. (I am still not entirely sure how Arthur got past them; please do let me know, if you should discover it.) And I wish you would advise me whether Thomas maintains a continuous scrying spell on the gazing ball in his study. Arthur claims to have seen things in it, and if he is neither making up tales nor using an existing spell, I may need to find him a magic tutor who can oversee more advanced work than his present teacher.<br>&nbsp;James is going up to London to consult with the Duke of Wellington. (I suppose I ought now to say with the prime minister, but I am not yet accustomed to thinking of him so.) Though I am not sure what the duke has in mind this time, I am quite pleased for him by this turn of events. James becomes bored and most unhappy when he does not have enough to do, which is a habit I am sure he picked up on the Peninsula when he was aide-de-camp to Lord Wellington. And whatever the duke needs, I doubt it will be boring!<br>&nbsp;At first, I had hoped to go to London along with James, but both Baby Alexander and Diana show signs of coming down with Eleanor&#x2019;s cold, and I really cannot leave Nurse to manage them all alone, most especially if Arthur is going to remain in good health. For he is sure to get into some scrape while her back is turned, and she has a decided partiality for him that sometimes persuades her to be less firm with him than she ought.<br>&nbsp;Indeed, I am feeling nearly as sulky as the children, for I had been looking forward to seeing Aunt Elizabeth and Mr. Wrexton again. What with Mr. Wrexton&#x2019;s work at the Royal College of Wizards, they are so firmly settled in London now that it is nearly impossible to induce them to visit outside the city. (I cannot bring myself to call Mr. Wrexton &#x201c;Uncle Michael,&#x201d; though he and Aunt Elizabeth have been married these ten years. I suppose I have never quite got out of the habit of thinking of him as my magic tutor.) I especially wanted Mr. Wrexton&#x2019;s opinion of the discursive-chain cantrips Thomas and I had that disagreement about.<br>&nbsp;I had also hoped to order a few gowns in advance of the Season, and to review the redecorating of our town house (for you know that now the duke is become prime minister, we shall have all kinds of distinguished persons visiting, so it is most important that everything be properly done).<br>&nbsp;Now it must all be left to the last minute, for James is quite hopeless at such things. I daresay he would not notice even if the drapers put crimson drapes in the blue salon. It is most provoking, and of course I cannot complain of it to James. So I write to you instead.<br>Love,<br>Cecy<br>&nbsp;<br>~&nbsp;25 FEBRUARY 1828<br>TANGLEFORD HALL, KENT<br>My dear Thomas,<br>&nbsp;The eldest of my young hellions has confessed to sneaking into your study near the end of our visit. The offense has already met with suitable punishment, but I trust you will let me know of any damage or disruption that he has not seen fit to mention. He has not provided any reason for the excursion other than a desire &#x201c;to see a real wizard&#x2019;s study.&#x201d; Sometimes I think he takes after my dear Cecelia a little too much.<br>&nbsp;I am off to London as soon as may be. Wellington&#x2019;s summons was waiting for me when we arrived home. I am not yet entirely sure what the business is about, which will tell you a good deal right there. Unless he has good reason, Old Hookey has always been clear about his orders; I infer that the matter is serious. I need not tell you to be discreet.<br>&nbsp;Cecelia stays here with the children. I shall write when I know more, and tell you what I can.<br>Yours,<br>James&nbsp;Copyright � 2006 by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer<br>All rights reserved.

Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents and vivid details about the Nantucket whaling tradition to reveal the chilling facts of this infamous maritime disaster. <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i>&#x2014;and now, its epic adaptation for the screen&#x2014;will forever place the <i>Essex </i>tragedy in the American historical canon.</p><p>The appeal of Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> was, in part, that it illuminated a little-known piece of history through a series of captivating incidents and engaging personalities. Nathaniel Philbrick's <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is certainly cast from the same mold, examining the 19th-century Pacific whaling industry through the arc of the sinking of the whaleship <i>Essex</i> by a boisterous sperm whale. The story that inspired Herman Melville's classic <i>Moby-Dick</i> has a lot going for it--derring-do, cannibalism, rescue--and Philbrick proves an amiable and well-informed narrator, providing both context and detail. We learn about the importance and mechanics of blubber production--a vital source of oil--and we get the nuts and bolts of harpooning and life aboard whalers. We are spared neither the nitty-gritty of open boats nor the sucking of human bones dry.<p> By sticking to the tried and tested <i>Longitude</i> formula, Philbrick has missed a slight trick or two. The epicenter of the whaling industry was Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod; most of the whales were in the Pacific, necessitating a huge journey around the southernmost tip of South America. We never learn why no one ever tried to create an alternative whaling capital somewhere nearer. Similarly, Philbrick tells us that the story of the <i>Essex</i> was well known to Americans for decades, but he never explores how such legends fade from our consciousness. Philbrick would no doubt reply that such questions were beyond his remit, and you can't exactly accuse him of skimping on his research. By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly. He doesn't get bogged down in turgid detail, and his narrative rattles along at a nice pace. When the storyline is as good as this, you can't really ask for more. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Art Therapy Sourcebook</h2><p><p>Art therapy is a process that helps people of all ages to express and understand feelings, interests, relationships, and self-perceptions through art activities. It has been useful in treating emotional trauma and grief, as a supplement to pain and symptom management, to address psychological distress, and to encourage self-growth and actualization. <i>The Art Therapy Sourcebook</i> is a guide for people who want to use art as a way of understanding themselves better. It starts with information on necessary supplies and takes the reader on a journey toward understanding the connection between artistic images and human emotions.</p></p><p><p><b>Cathy Malchiodi, M.A., A.T.R., L.P.A.T., L.P.C.C.</b>, is a licensed professional art therapist and licensed professional clinical counselor. She is the current editor of <i>Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association</i> and the author of <i>Breaking the Silence: Art Therapy with Children from Violent Homes</i>.</p>Introduction/Preface <p>The language of visual art -- colors, shapes, lines, and images -- speaks to us in ways which words cannot. Art therapy is a modality which uses the non-verbal language of art for personal growth, insight, and transformation and is a means of bridging what is inside us -- our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions -- with outer realities and life experiences. It based on the belief that images can help us to understand who we are, communicate feelings, thoughts, and experiences which words cannot, and enhance life through self-expression. </p><p>While the field of art therapy is relatively new, the idea that art making can be a form of therapy is very old and one of the most ancient forms of healing. The visual arts -- drawing, painting, and sculpture -- are powerful and effective forms of communication which have been used to convey humanitys collective history, ideas, feelings, dreams, and aspirations. Art has always been used to chronicle and portray a wide range of emotions and experiences, from profound joy to the deepest sorrow, from triumph to trauma. Since our earliest recorded history, art has also served as a means of reparation, rehabilitation, and transformation, and has been used to restore physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being. </p><p>In recent years, we have rediscovered the benefits of art making for personal growth, self-expression, transformation, and wellness. Many people have found that art making can be soothing and stress reducing, a way to transcend troubling circumstances or lifes problems. Others have experienced how imagery helps to solve problems, release powerful or distressing emotions, recover from traumatic losses or experiences, or alleviate pain or other physical symptoms. You yourself may already be using art as a form of therapy and may paint, draw, or sculpt for relaxation, gratification, and self-expression. </p><p>In response to this recognition that art can help people authentically express themselves, release powerful emotions, transcend trauma, and enhance health and well-being, the field of art therapy has grown and expanded in the last two decades, becoming a recognized form of treatment in health and medicine. Art therapy is based on the idea that the creative process of art making is healing and life enhancing, and that it is an potent form of communication of feelings, thoughts, and experiences. It utilizes the creative process which exists within every individual to promote growth, self-expression, emotional reparation, conflict resolution, and transformation. Through art making as therapy you may find relief from overwhelming emotions, crises, or trauma, discover insights about yourself, achieve an increased sense of well-being, enrich your daily life, or experience personal change. It is way to make sense of that which is painful, to create personal meaning, to enhance wellness, and to become whole. </p><p>This book will provide you with an overview of the field of art therapy and explain power of art making for personal growth, insight, and transformation. It will introduce you to what art therapy is, where is came from, and why it is a powerful way of knowing yourself and an equally powerful way of healing. It will also familiarize you with some of the many ways art making as therapy can help you authentically express yourself, reduce stress, confront and resolve trauma or loss, and enhance your health and well-being. </p><p>Because art therapy is an action-oriented, experiential modality for self-exploration and growth, it is important that you experience it not only through reading this book, but also through your own art making. What I have described about art therapy will be more meaningful if you become an active participant in learning about arts healing potential through expressing yourself in simple drawing, painting, and collage exercises presented throughout this book. What I have learned about the therapeutic benefits of art making not only has come from reading about and studying the field of art therapy, but also my own work as an artist. The personal experiences of art making as therapy in my own life have ultimately informed my understanding of its transformative and reparative qualities. </p><p>I have also learned from others-- clients, artists, students, and colleagues -- why art is restorative and healing; many of their stories are described throughout this book. In two decades of working as an art therapist with children who have been abused or traumatized, children and adults with serious or life-threatening illnesses, and families experiencing trauma or loss, and teaching thousands of people in art therapy workshops and studios, I have been repeatedly taught about important connections between the creative process of image making and health. These experiences have proven to me that art is a potent and effective means of self-expression available to people of all ages and capabilities, that everyone can benefit from arts ability to repair and restore, and that art making as therapy can play a vital role in health, healing, and wholeness.</p></p><h2>Rembrandt: The Old Testament</h2><p>Universally acclaimed as one of the greatest artists of all time, Rembrandt often turned to Scripture for inspiration.

Today, the Fed is the bedrock of the financial landscape, yet the fight to create it was so protracted and divisive that it seems a small miracle that it was ever established. <br><br>For nearly a century, America, alone among developed nations, refused to consider any central or organizing agency in its financial system. Americans&#x2019; mistrust of big government and of big banks&#x2014;a legacy of the country&#x2019;s Jeffersonian, small-government traditions&#x2014;was so widespread that modernizing reform was deemed impossible. Each bank was left to stand on its own, with no central reserve or lender of last resort. The real-world consequences of this chaotic and provincial system were frequent financial panics, bank runs, money shortages, and depressions. By the first decade of the twentieth century, it had become plain that the outmoded banking system was ill equipped to finance America&#x2019;s burgeoning industry. But political will for reform was lacking. It took an economic meltdown, a high-level tour of Europe, and&#x2014;improbably&#x2014;a conspiratorial effort by vilified captains of Wall Street to overcome popular resistance. Finally, in 1913, Congress conceived a federalist and quintessentially American solution to the conflict that had divided bankers, farmers, populists, and ordinary Americans, and enacted the landmark Federal Reserve Act.<br><br>Roger Lowenstein&#x2014;acclaimed financial journalist and bestselling author of <i>When Genius Failed</i> and <i>The End of Wall Street</i>&#x2014;tells the drama-laden story of how America created the Federal Reserve, thereby taking its first steps onto the world stage as a global financial power. <i>America&#x2019;s Bank</i> showcases Lowenstein at his very finest: illuminating complex financial and political issues with striking clarity, infusing the debates of our past with all the gripping immediacy of today, and painting unforgettable portraits of Gilded Age bankers, presidents, and politicians.<br><br>Lowenstein focuses on the four men at the heart of the struggle to create the Federal Reserve. These were Paul Warburg, a refined, German-born financier, recently relocated to New York, who was horrified by the primitive condition of America&#x2019;s finances; Rhode Island&#x2019;s Nelson W. Aldrich, the reigning power broker in the U.S. Senate and an archetypal Gilded Age legislator; Carter Glass, the ambitious, if then little-known, Virginia congressman who chaired the House Banking Committee at a crucial moment of political transition; and President Woodrow Wilson, the academician-turned-progressive-politician who forced Glass to reconcile his deep-seated differences with bankers and accept the principle (anathema to southern Democrats) of federal control. Weaving together a raucous era in American politics with a storied financial crisis and intrigue at the highest levels of Washington and Wall Street, Lowenstein brings the beginnings of one of the country&#x2019;s most crucial institutions to vivid and unforgettable life. Readers of this gripping historical narrative will wonder whether they&#x2019;re reading about one hundred years ago or the still-seething conflicts that mark our discussions of banking and politics today.&nbsp;</p><p>ROGER LOWENSTEIN reported for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> for more than a decade.

As the country put up factories and laid down rails, the tension between its antiquated finances and its smokestack-dotted towns grew ever more acute. Heated battles over &#x201c;the money question&#x201d; came to dominate the country&#x2019;s politics, but no matter how unsatisfied the people, any solution that tended toward centralization was, due to the&nbsp;prevailing prejudice, off the table.</p><p>America was a monetary Babel with thousands of currencies; each state regulated its own banks and they collectively provided the country&#x2019;s money. Officially, America was on a hard-money basis, but the amount of gold in circulation was insignificant. In any event, as a contemporary would write, it was impractical for a traveler &#x201c;to carry with him the coin necessary to meet his expenses for a protracted journey.&#x201d; If he traveled with notes of any but a few of the biggest banks in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, his money was likely to be refused, or greatly discounted. If he did carry gold, then, &#x201c;at the hotel, in the railroad car, on the river or lake,&#x201d; he would be of�fered slips of engraved paper that, in the words of a western banker, might include &#x201c;the frequently worthless issues of the State of Maine and of other New England States, the shinplasters of Michigan, the wild cats of Georgia, of Canada, and Pennsylvania, the red dogs of Indiana and Nebraska, the miserably engraved notes of North Caro�lina, Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia, and the not-to-be-forgotten stump tails of Illinois and Wisconsin.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, these notes were redeemable in gold or in state bonds, but notes from western banks were notoriously unreliable. Bankers, not surprisingly, sought to circulate their paper as far as possible from the point of issue. That way, the notes might never&#x2014;or not for a very long while&#x2014;return and the bank avoided the annoying detail of having to redeem its debts. There was no institution to regulate either the quality or the quantity of money, and after states adopted so-called free banking, a promoter needed little more than a printing press to set up shop. In 1853, Indiana&#x2019;s governor lamented, &#x201c;The spec�ulator comes to Indianapolis with a bundle of banknotes in one hand and the stock in the other; in twenty-four hours he is on his way to some distant point of the union to circulate what he denominates a legal currency, authorized by the legislature of Indiana.&#x201d; The system was certainly democratic&#x2014;almost anyone could issue &#x201c;money&#x201d;&#x2014;but it was just as certain to lead to credit booms and inevitable busts.</p><p>According to Jay Cooke, a Philadelphia financier, some banks issued notes equal to twenty-five times their capital &#x201c;with no other security than the good faith of their institution.&#x201d; Since such faith was often short-lived, Cooke hardly needed to add, &#x201c;confusion . . . was the order of the day.&#x201d; During the Civil War, the Chicago Tribune counted 1,395 banks in the Union states, each with bills of various denominations&#x2014;some 8,370 varieties of notes in all. Even for the careful bank teller, scrutinizing this profusion of paper became an almost hopeless task. In addition to bank failures, the country was plagued by con men whose note forgeries could be worthy of a Rem�brandt. So widespread were phony notes that &#x201c;Counterfeit Detectors&#x201d; were published, and these guides were widely circulated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This monetary chaos formed the tableau for late-nineteenth�century reformers, and it is key to understanding how people of Glass&#x2019;s generation thought about money. Money&#x2014;generally, gold or silver&#x2014;was something of intrinsic value. Circulating paper, even though it served as a medium of exchange, was but a token, a promise of the real thing, discounted according to the degree to which people feared that the promise might not be kept.</p><p>Legislation during the Civil War provided a remedy&#x2014;somewhat. With the government desperate for credit, Lincoln&#x2019;s Treasury secre�tary, Salmon P. Chase, was left no choice but to propose, and Con�gress to approve, a new system of nationally chartered banks, which were permitted to issue circulating paper money in the form of National Bank Notes. These notes were to be a new, and mercifully uniform, currency, with a standard engraving on one side and the bank&#x2019;s name on the other. </p><p>However, note circulation was tightly controlled. National banks had to hold a reserve and submit to federal banking examinations. Also, to issue notes, they had to invest in a proportionate amount of government bonds and deposit them with the Treasury as collateral. This requirement heightened the demand for government securities&#x2014;which was, of course, Chase&#x2019;s purpose. By giving banks an incentive to invest in&nbsp;government debt, the United States contrived a means of financing the war. National banks were formed at a rapid clip, and many state banks converted to federal charters so they could qualify to circulate notes.[i] </p><p>The new notes were surely an improvement, but they had the drawback of arbitrariness. The quantity in circulation was determined by the level of investment in government bonds, and this bore no re�lation to the needs of trade. Perversely, circulation often fell as busi�ness activity expanded and banks found better outlets for their capital. Just as worrisome, the note supply was inelastic&#x2014;banks held the quantity of bonds that they held, and no new notes could be issued in a crisis. The modern notion of a central bank to supply extra liquidity when needed simply did not exist.</p><p>It is hard to overly blame Chase because, as he said, his goal was &#x201c;first to provide for the vast demands of the war.&#x201d; Chase was lauded for standardizing the currency and blunting the prior ability of banks to create inflation by circulating worthless paper. William G. Sum�ner, an influential economist at Yale, fairly rejoiced: &#x201c;This system of currency has put an end at once and forever to the old bankers&#x2019; trick of expansion and contraction.&#x201d; That economies do expand&#x2014;and that currency needs to expand with them&#x2014;was largely overlooked.</p><p>Also overlooked, for the moment, was the precarious manner in which the National Banking Act marshaled the country&#x2019;s reserves. In Great Britain or in France, reserves were stored in the central bank. In America, the Banking Act introduced an intricate and fragile sys�tem, with the reserves of one bank piled upon another.</p><p>The law recognized three distinct tiers of banks. The smallest, so-called country banks, had to either keep reserves in their vaults or deposit a portion with middle-tier banks in the city. The latter, in turn, could hold cash in the vault or deposit a portion of their reserves with banks in the highest tier, those in the &#x201c;central reserve cities&#x201d; of New York, Chicago, and St. Louis. In practice, since banks did not want to hold idle cash, reserves flowed to New York. And since the New York banks did not want idle money either, they lent their spare&nbsp;cash to the stock market. Thus, America&#x2019;s banking system was perched on a speculative pyramid. Whenever credit was in short sup�ply, the entire chain backed into reverse, with country banks calling their loans, by means of urgent telegrams, to banks in reserve cities and thence to New York. This could precipitate panicky selling in the stock market. As Glass was to write, the system was a &#x201c;breeder of panics,&#x201d; with the idle funds of the nation &#x201c;congested at the money centres for purely speculative purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This defect quickly became apparent. In 1873, when the new era was not quite a decade old, Jay Cooke&#x2019;s firm, having improvidently speculated on railroad bonds, collapsed. The failure touched off a depression, which lasted six years. In a telltale sign of the system&#x2019;s defects, note circulation sharply declined. Even when business recov�ered, the country was visited by periodic shortages of cash, or &#x201c;strin�gencies,&#x201d; when interest rates would soar to as much as 100 percent. The problem was most acute in the fall, when farmers needed cash to&nbsp;move the crops. Farmhands had to be hired, horses fed, machin�ery&nbsp;operated, shipping procured. The agrarian economy, as it were, sprung to life and required bundles of cash. This imbalanced the relative currency demands of city and farm, resulting in regular short�ages. No central reservoir existed to smooth out the seasonal&nbsp;lumpi�ness. In short, the system suffered a serious deficit: it consistently failed to generate enough money.</p><p>One obvious solution was to supply more money, but that begged the question &#x201c;Who should supply it, and what kind of money?&#x201d; Though the new National Bank Notes served as walking-around money, the United States actually had seven different mediums of exchange circulating in varying amounts.[ii] During Glass&#x2019;s early life(the first few decades after the Civil War), Americans of every station fiercely debated how to bring order to this fiscal cacophony. In par�ticular, they argued bitterly over whether gold should be supplemented by additional currency of some other type, including &#x201c;greenbacks,&#x201d; the colloquial name for the paper notes issued by the federal government during the Civil War. Because greenbacks were not supported by any metal or tangible asset, the banking class considered them abhorrent. They were mere paper, &#x201c;fiat&#x201d; money (exactly what circu�lates today) and, to nineteenth-century bankers, an unpardonable blasphemy. In time, Congress decided to make greenbacks exchange�able for gold, and people who wanted to add to the currency shifted gears and proposed that the money supply be enhanced with notes that were backed by silver, which was more plentiful than gold. To supporters of the gold standard, silver, too, would merely cheapen the currency; it was both morally and economically repugnant.</p><p>Gold&#x2019;s champions tended to be creditors&#x2014;people with capital. They didn&#x2019;t want the currency debased because they didn&#x2019;t want to be&nbsp;repaid in cheaper coin. Gold being scarcer than silver, it was more valuable. In the 1870s, much of the world had joined Britain and gone on a gold standard (agreeing to back their currencies with gold). In1879, the United States did so as well. But Congress, trying to appease the farm lobby, directed the Treasury to also mint limited amounts of silver dollars, and at the historic ratio to gold of 16 to 1. Since the bul�lion value of a silver &#x201c;dollar&#x201d; was, by then, appreciably less, owing to a divergence in the metals&#x2019; prices, bankers and Republicans regarded silver as a profane dilution. Grover Cleveland, a &#x201c;gold Democrat&#x201d; elected president in 1884 and again in 1892, spoke for Wall Street and for respectable opinion generally when he observed that if America went to a silver standard, &#x201c;we could no longer claim a place among nations of the first class.&#x201d; </p><p>As a practical matter, bankers were correct that the bimetallic sys�tem of gold and silver was inherently unstable, since people would seek to cash in the poorer coin (in this case, the silver) for the richer one. But the gold standard imposed severe hardships on a great many Americans. In plain terms, the production of gold was not sufficient to support an adequate supply of money.</p><p>The issue was extremely divisive, because money shortages af�fected Americans unevenly. American farmers, de Tocqueville noted, were less peasants than little businessmen. They took out loans for seed and equipment. When prices fell, their debts became crushing. Credit in farm communities was exceedingly scarce. The rigid rules of the Banking Act proscribed lending on real estate, which undercut the usefulness of national banks in rural areas. Cash was even scarcer. There were fewer bank notes issued in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee combined than in the tiny East�ern Seaboard state of Connecticut. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hardship, and its palpable inequity, spawned a political awakening&#x2014;a cry for redress. People blamed the money scarcity on Wall Street or on its British equivalent, Lombard Street. Carter Glass was one of those. His sense of grievance was nourished by his diffi�cult beginnings. Glass had been born in Lynchburg, Virginia, three years before the Civil War. His mother died when he was two, and his father, a publisher and a major in the Confederate ranks, suffered painful setbacks during the war, when he forfeited a vast quantity of cotton and had to sell his newspaper. After the war, he was offered the job of postmaster but refused to work for the federal government. Major Glass also had political ambitions, but these were frustrated by Reconstruction. For his son, it was a bitter inheritance, compounded by the sight of federal troops occupying Virginia. Carter, though, was a determined lad. Frail, with sallow skin and thin lips, often sickly with digestive problems and only five foot four, he was known as &#x201c;Pluck&#x201d; owing to his stubbornness and fiery temper. At age fourteen, he was forced to quit school but continued his studies at night, read�ing his father&#x2019;s copies of Plato, Burke, and Shakespeare by kerosene lamp. Although Glass found work at a newspaper, his prospects were dimmed by the depression that ensued in 1873. Glass&#x2019;s view of this calamity was informed by his hostility to northern banks. For six straight years, as he tried to make his way in the world, the money stock shrank. Where did the money go? Gold had sucked it up&#x2014;so he believed. New York and London were in on it together. He reck�oned that a malign conspiracy of financiers was to blame. Because he mistrusted power, he did not want more power. He did not want a central bank. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1880, Glass finally got the job he wanted&#x2014;newspaper reporter. Rising to publisher within a decade, Glass ceaselessly editorialized for silver. &#x201c;Why should gold be minted free [in unlimited amounts], any more than silver?&#x201d; he thundered in the Lynchburg News. Glass&#x2019;s crusade was as much emotional as deductive. &#x201c;I confess that with all I have read on both sides of the currency questions, I understand very little about it,&#x201d; he confided to a comrade. &#x201c;But when I see the merci�less forces of corporate and individual wealth arrayed on one side, and the working, toiling masses on the other, I can but feel that you and I are right in the stand we have taken.&#x201d;</p><p>Silver-money advocates are often portrayed this way&#x2014;as emotional and ignorant. But their distress was real. Over the course of three decades&#x2014;beginning when Carter Glass was a boy&#x2014;prices in Amer�ica steadily declined. No American born after the Great Depression has ever experienced even two consecutive years of deflation but, as�tonishingly, from 1867 to 1897 prices skidded relentlessly lower, and over the whole of that period they tumbled well more than 50 percent. In 1867, when the future congressman was nine years old, a bushel of winter wheat fetched $2.84; thirty years later it was selling for a mere 90 cents. </p><p>Although the price of goods was falling, it is equally true, and more illuminating, to say that the price of money was rising. This was occurring fo...</p></p><h2>Sin Killer (The Berrybender Narratives)</h2><p>Journeying up the Missouri River in 1830, the wealthy Berrybenders encounter the challenges of the untamed American West and a variety of people, including Native Americans, pioneers, and explorers, before Tasmin Berrybender falls in love with frontiersman and part-time preacher Jim Snow. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Larry McMurtry's <i>Sin Killer</i> is a wildly entertaining ride through the untamed Great Plains. The first installment of a proposed tetralogy, The Berrybender Narratives, <i>Sin Killer</i> follows the adventures of the Berrybenders, a large, noble English family traveling the Missouri River in 1832. This deeply self-absorbed and spoiled family leaves England for the unknown of the American West, based solely on a "whim" and Lord Berrybender's desire to "shoot different animals from those he shot at home." The novel joins the family as they make their way toward Yellowstone aboard a luxury steamer, accompanied by a motley assemblage of servants, guides, and natives. Along the way, this "floating Europe" and its bickering, stubborn passengers encounter constant adversity, including warring natives, hellacious weather, accidental deaths, and kidnappings. <p> Thanks largely to <i>Sin Killer</i>'s gallery of colorful personalities, McMurtry keeps most of the action firmly in the realm of fish-out-of-water farce. One such character is the independent and opinionated eldest daughter Tasmin, who, frustrated by her family's conventions, escapes the steamer, whereupon she meets and falls in love with Jim Snow, a.k.a. Sin Killer. Snow, an Indian killer raised by natives, is a stoical, God-fearing man who won't tolerate blasphemy. With prose that flows as naturally as the Missouri, McMurtry weaves together a large cast and vast setting into a thoroughly exciting, hilarious adventure novel. Though <i>Sin Killer</i> focuses on a love story and contains plenty of realistic violence, McMurtry's efficient voice and matter-of-fact perspective leaves little room for tragedy or sentimentality, instead emphasizing high comedy. This is wonderful storytelling from a narrator in perfect agreement with his subject. <i>Sin Killer</i> should please McMurtry's many fans, who now have much to look forward to. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p><b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>.

It is a handbook to guide teens and adult converts to Lutheranism through Martin Luther&#39;s Small Catechism. I have used it in the past and recently purchased three copies because it is the only acceptable publication I have been able to locate to date. It is not as orthodox in Lutheran confessionalism as it could be but well within the range of acceptability. What is alarming is that no other publication for teens and adults exists. By saying this I convict myself as one too lazy to write my own catechism. Historically, pre-teens in Lutheran congregations in the United States have undertaken two years of catechism in preparation for confirmation as fully communicant members but no such tradition exists for adult converts, particularly those who convert from other Christian churches. They expect the catechetical process to be shorter and Strelan&#39;s book allows for a shorter catechism period, not that it is justified in all cases. American pastors should not be wary merely because of the book&#39;s county of origin. Australia is the home of excellent Lutheran theologians such as John Kleinig and Greg Lockwood as well as the late confessional giant, Herman Sasse.</p><p></p><h2>23 Things They Don&#39;t Tell You about Capitalism</h2><p>In &#34;23 Things They Don&#39;t Tell You About Capitalism&#34; one of today&#39;s most iconoclastic thinkers destroys the biggest myths about the world we live in. There&#39;s no such thing as a &#39;free&#39; market. Globalization isn&#39;t making the world richer. We don&#39;t live in a digital world - the washing machine has changed lives more than the internet. Poor countries are more entrepreneurial than rich ones. Higher paid managers don&#39;t produce better results. This galvanizing, fact-packed book about money, equality, freedom and greed proves that the free market isn&#39;t just bad for people - it&#39;s an inefficient way of running economies too. Here Chang lays out the alternatives, and shows there&#39;s a better way.</p><p>Born in South Korea, No 1 International Bestselling Author Ha-Joon Chang is a specialist in development economics and Reader in the Political Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge. In 2005, Chang was awarded the Wassily Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. He is author of Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective (2002), which won the 2003 Gunnar Myrdal Prize, and Bad Samaritans: Rich Nations, Poor Policies and the Threat to the Developing World (2007). Since the beginning of the 2008 economic crisis, he has been a regular contributor to the Guardian, and a vocal critic of the failures of our economic system.Chang (Bad Samaritans) takes on the "free-market ideologues," the stentorian voices in economic thought and, in his analysis, the engineers of the recent financial catastrophe. Free market orthodoxy has inserted its tenterhooks into almost every economy in the world--over the past three decades, most countries have privatized state-owned industrial and financial firms, deregulated finance and industry, liberalized international trade and investments, and reduced income taxes and welfare payments. But these policies have unleashed bubbles and ever increasing income disparity. How can we dig ourselves out? By examining the many myths in the narrative of free-market liberalism, crucially that the name is itself a misnomer: there is nothing "free" about a market where wages are largely politically determined; that greater macroeconomic stability has not made the world economy more stable; and a more educated population itself won't make a country richer. An advocate of big, active government and capitalism as distinct from a free market, Chang presents an enlightening pr�cis of modern economic thought--and all the places it's gone wrong, urging us to act in order to completely rebuild the world economy: "This will some readers uncomfortable... it is time to get uncomfortable."

In this, his first murder case, Lord Peter untangles the ghastly mystery of the corpse in the bath. &#34;Murder Must Advertise&#34;--When advertising executive Victor Dean dies from a fall down the stairs at Pym&#39;s Publicity, Lord Peter Wimsey is asked to investigate. It seems that, before he died, Dean had begun a letter to Mr. Pym suggesting some very unethical dealings at the posh London ad agency. Wimsey goes undercover and discovers that Dean was part of the fast crowd at Pym&#39;s, a group taken to partying and doing drugs. Wimsey and his brother-in-law, Chief-Inspector Parker, rush to discover who is running London&#39;s cocaine trade and how Pym&#39;s fits into the picture--all before Wimsey&#39;s cover is blown. &#34;Gaudy Night&#34;--When Harriet Vane attends her Oxford reunion, known as the &#34;Gaudy,&#34; the prim academic setting is haunted by a rash of bizarre pranks: scrawled obsentities, burnt effigies and poison-pen letters -- including one that says, &#34;Ask your boyfriend with the title if he likes arsenic in his soup.&#34;Some of the notes threaten murder; all are perfectly ghastly; yet in spite of their scurrilous nature, all are perfectly worded. And Harriet finds herself ensnared in a nightmare of romance and terror, with only the tiniest shreds of clues to challenge her powers of detection, and those of her paramour, Lord Peter Wimsey.</p><p></p><h2>The Golden One</h2><p><p>A new year, 1917, is dawning, and the Great War that ravages the world shows no sign of abating. Answering the siren call of Egypt once more, Amelia Peabody and her family arrive at their home in Luxor to learn of a new royal tomb ransacked by thieves. Soon an even more disturbing outrage concerns the intrepid clan of archaeologists: the freshly and savagely slain corpse of a thief defiling the ancient burial site.</p><p>Yet this is nothing compared with the lethal fate that threatens Ramses. Besieged by the British and defended by formidable Turkish and German forces, the fortified seaport of Gaza guards the gateway to the Holy Land. Answering a call he cannot refuse from British military intelligence, Ramses must journey to this ancient, fabled city to undertake a mission as personal as it is perilous. Death will surely be his lot if he is caught or exposed. Meanwhile, Ramses's wife, Nefret, guards a secret of her own....</p><p>Once again the incomparable and bestselling carries us to a breathtaking realm of ancient wonders and crumbling splendor -- from the hectic bustle of the Cairo markets to remote, sand-swept corners of the Egyptian desert where the gods of antiquity sleep. Returning visitors to the world of Amelia Peabody will be enthralled by the latest mesmerizing adventure from the award-winning grandmaster, and newcomers will succumb to her wiles as they are caught up in the tantalizing spell of the remarkable Elizabeth Peters and <em>The Golden One.</em></p></p><p><p>Elizabeth Peters earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute. She was named Grand Master at the inaugural Anthony Awards in 1986 and Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1998. In 2003, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Malice Domestic Convention. She lives in a historic farmhouse in western Maryland.</p>Victorian adventuress Amelia Peabody is back in the fourteenth of this popular series, read with giddy brilliance by Barbara Rosenblat. It's 1917, the Great War is ravaging throughout Europe and Asia, and Peabody and her husband, Egyptologist Radcliffe Emerson, are chasing tomb robbers in Luxor. Meanwhile, their son, British spy Ramses Emerson, travels to Gaza on a dangerous mission of his own. Plot-wise, the story is weak and somewhat muddled. But Peters's real talent is in creating lovably eccentric characters whom Rosenblat nimbly brings to life. Rosenblat displays her versatile talents by giving voice to British explorers, American scoundrels, Egyptian muftis, and Turkish spies. A very entertaining romp in the Middle East.

Heartily and happily distracted upon his arrival by the landscape, the weather, and the food?not to mention the gorgeous <i>notaire </i>handling the estate and the stunning owner of the local bistro?Max almost forgets about his inherited property<i>.</i> <br> <br>Which might have been a good idea, because the wine produced there is swill. But then why, Max has to wonder, is his caretaker so anxious to acquire the land? When a beautiful young woman from California arrives with what might be a legitimate claim on the estate, and knowledge of vineyards that far outstrips Max&#x2019;s own, the plot begins its twists and turns into and out of truly wonderful complications and resolutions. <br> <br>This is luscious reading?soothing us with the sensual wonders of Provence while it tells a fascinating tale of the hugely lucrative and competitive boutique-wine trade. It is Peter Mayle&#x2019;s most satisfying, most delectable novel yet.</p><p>Peter Mayle eats, drinks, writes, and lives in Provence. This is his ninth book, and his fifth novel.One<br><br>It was high summer in London, and the raindrops felt almost warm on Max Skinner&#x2019;s face as he ran up Rutland Gate and into Hyde Park. He followed the curve of the Serpentine while the shapes of other people determined to suffer before breakfast came and went in the gray predawn murk, their faces slick with rain and sweat, their progress marked by the moist slap of their footsteps on the path.<br><br>The weather had discouraged all but the hard-core joggers. It was too wet for those bouncing, pink-cheeked girls who sometimes provided Max with a little welcome distraction. Too wet for the resident flasher who was usually on duty behind a bush near the bandstand, leer and raincoat at the ready. Too wet even for the pair of Jack Russells whose joy it was to nip at every passing ankle, their embarrassed owner lumbering after them mouthing apologies.<br><br>It was too wet, and perhaps too early. Max had been getting into the office late recently, often as late as seven-thirty, and Amis, his boss and nemesis, was not pleased. This morning would be different, Max promised himself. He&#x2019;d get in first, and make sure the miserable sod knew it. That was the big problem with Max&#x2019;s work- ing life: he liked the job but loathed the people, Amis in particular.<br><br>Turning at the top of the Serpentine, Max started back toward the Albert Memorial, his thoughts on the day ahead. There was a deal that he&#x2019;d been nursing along for months, a deal that would deliver a bonus big enough to pay his infinitely patient tailor and, much more important, get the bank off his back. Occasional murmurs of discontent about the size of his overdraft had turned into letters couched in ever more menacing terms, underlining the fact that it had been a lean year so far. But it was going to change, Max felt sure. With a surge of optimism, he sprinted down Rutland Gate, shook himself like a dog on the doorstep, and let himself into the stucco-fronted Georgian house that a developer had gutted and converted into what he described as highly desirable executive pieds-�-terre.<br><br>The janitor of the building, a gnome of a man with a papery, subterranean complexion, looked up from his vacuum cleaner and clucked his tongue at the trail of wet footprints Max was leaving on the carpet.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be the death of me, you will. Look at that bleeding mud, all over my Axminster.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Bert. I keep forgetting to take off my shoes before I come in.&#x201d;<br><br>Bert sniffed. They had the same conversation every time it rained, and it always ended with the same question. Bert was a keen follower of the stock market, and longed for the chance to do a little insider trading. &#x201c;Got any good tips for today, then?&#x201d;<br><br>Max paused at the door of the elevator and put a finger to his lips before speaking. &#x201c;Buy low. Sell high. Don&#x2019;t tell a soul.&#x201d;<br><br>Bert shook his head. Cheeky young git. But then, he was the only one in the building to remember Bert&#x2019;s birthday with a bottle of Scotch, and there was always a nicely filled envelope from him at Christmas. Not a bad lad, thought Bert, as he pushed the vacuum cleaner back and forth over the traces of wet mud.<br><br>Max&#x2019;s second-floor apartment was a work in prog- ress; or, as a decorator friend with his eye on a lucrative assignment had said, an unfinished symphony. At the moment, it was a place used for sleep and very little else. There were two good modern paintings leaning against the wall, a few pieces of spiky avant-garde furniture, a dusty and sorry-looking ficus, a battery of stereo and video equipment. Despite having been there for more than two years, Max had managed to avoid giving the apartment any personal touches, apart from a small pile of running shoes in one corner. He went into the tiny, unused kitchen, opened the refrigerator, empty except for a bottle of vodka and a carton of orange juice, and took the carton with him into the bathroom.<br><br>Hot water and cold juice. The after-run shower was a daily reward for one of his few healthy habits. He worked too hard, ate in the irregular way of bachelors, slept too little, and certainly drank more than the five units of alcohol a week decreed, with sanctimonious relish, by the company doctor. But he ran, and he was young. Forty was several years away, and by then, he told himself, he would have his life and his finances in order, ready to settle down and&#x2014;who knows&#x2014;make another gallant attempt at matrimony.<br><br>He studied his reflection in the shaving mirror. Blue eyes, only slightly bloodshot; dark brown hair, cut short in the current fashion; skin taut over high cheekbones. As yet, no obvious bags or wrinkles. Could be worse, he thought, as he stepped over the wet towel and discarded running clothes on the bathroom floor.<br><br>Five minutes later, he was ready to conquer the financial universe, dressed in the uniform and trappings of the modern young executive: dark suit, dark blue shirt, dark tie, a bulky watch designed for deep-sea divers obsessed with punctuality, cell phone and car keys at the ready. He ducked through the drizzle and into the obligatory black BMW for the drive to the City, where today, he felt sure, the long-awaited deal would come through. And then the bonus. He&#x2019;d finish furnishing the apartment, hire a housecleaner to keep it spotless, take a few days off, and drive down to Saint-Tropez before all the girls went back to Paris. Not even the weather forecast on the radio&#x2014;scattered showers, followed by outbreaks of heavier rain, with a chance of hail&#x2014;could dampen his spirits. This was going to be a good day.<br><br>At this time of the morning, twenty minutes should have been more than enough to get him into the Lawton Brothers&#x2019; offices. They were at the top end of Threadneedle Street&#x2014;&#x201c;handy for the Bank of England,&#x201d; as the senior Lawton brother was fond of telling his prospective clients. Established in the late eighties, the company had boomed through the nineties with everyone else, merging and acquiring, ducking and diving, and gaining a reputation for savage asset-stripping that was the envy of its more ethical and kindhearted competitors. Now it was often described in the financial press as a model of tough, efficient management, well suited to today&#x2019;s hard times. Young executives who survived a few years at Lawtons could survive anywhere.<br><br>Max&#x2019;s cell phone rang as he was coming down Ludgate Hill. It was just before six-thirty.<br><br>&#x201c;Taking the morning off, are we?&#x201d; It was the voice of Amis, nasal and aggressive. He didn&#x2019;t wait for Max to answer. &#x201c;We need to talk. See if you can get in here by lunchtime. Tracy will tell you the restaurant.&#x201d;<br><br>So much for my good day, Max thought. Although, if he were honest with himself, no day that included Amis could be entirely good. Mutual dislike had been in the air the instant the two men met, when Amis had swaggered in, fresh from spending three years in New York, to run the London office. From the start, their relationship had been tainted, as is so often the case in England, by the simple difference in the way they spoke English. Their accents.<br><br>Max was the product of a minor public school, and had grown up in the leafy, middle-class comfort of the Surrey hills. Amis was born and raised in the grim outer reaches of south London, neither leafy nor comfortable. In fact, they had grown up less than twenty miles apart, but it might as well have been twenty thousand. Max liked to think that there was not a trace of snobbery in him. Amis liked to think that he didn&#x2019;t have a chip on his shoulder. They were both wrong. But each had a grudging respect for the other&#x2019;s ability, and so, with difficulty, they tolerated one another.<br><br>Easing the BMW into its appointed slot in the underground garage, Max tried to guess the reason for today&#x2019;s meeting. Lunch at Lawtons was normally a sandwich at your desk, eyes glued to the screen. Lunch, in a phrase that Amis had picked up in New York, was for wimps. And yet here he was talking about a proper lunch with knives and forks&#x2014;a wimp&#x2019;s lunch&#x2014;in a restaurant. It was curious. Max was still puzzling over it as he stepped out of the elevator and made his way through the rows of partitions to his own cubicle.</p><h2>Cell: A Novel</h2><p>The next call you take could be your last in this terrifying #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller by Stephen King.<br><br>WHERE WERE YOU ON OCTOBER 1ST AT 3:03 P.M.?<br> <br> Graphic artist Clay Riddell was in the heart of Boston on that brilliant autumn afternoon when hell was unleashed before his eyes. Without warning, carnage and chaos reigned. Ordinary people fell victim to the basest, most animalistic destruction.<br> <br> And the apocalypse began with the ring of a cell phone....</p><p>Witness Stephen King's triumphant, blood-spattered return to the genre that made him famous. <i>Cell</i>, the king of horror's homage to zombie films (the book is dedicated in part to George A. Romero) is his goriest, most horrific novel in years, not to mention the most intensely paced. Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. <p> In <i>Cell</i> King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity, leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of "normies," must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. </p><p> Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate <i>Cell</i> as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal <i>Dark Tower</i> series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either). "Retirement" clearly suits King, and lucky for us, having nothing left to prove frees him up to write frenzied, juiced-up horror-thrillers like <i>Cell</i>. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

IF there is a moon falling from her mouth, she is a woman who knows her magic, who can share or not share her powers. A woman with a moon falling from her mouth, roses between her legs and tiaras of Spanish moss, this woman is a consort of the spirits.<br>Indigo seldom spoke. There was a moon in her mouth. Having a moon in her mouth kept her laughing. Whenever her mother tried to pull the moss off her head, or clip the roses round her thighs, Indigo was laughing.<br>&#x201c;Mama, if you pull &#x2018;em off, they&#x2019;ll just grow back. It&#x2019;s my blood. I&#x2019;ve got earth blood, filled up with the Geechees long gone, and the sea.&#x201d;<br>Sitting among her dolls, Indigo looked quite mad. As a small child, she stuffed socks with red beans, raw rice, sawdust or palm leaves. Tied ribbons made necks, so they could have heads and torsos. Then eyes from carefully chosen buttons or threads, hair from yarns specially dyed by her sisters and her mama, dresses of the finest silk patches, linen shoes and cotton underskirts, satin mitts or gloves embroidered with the delight of a child&#x2019;s hand. These creatures were still her companions, keeping pace with her changes, her moods and dreams, as no one else could. Indigo heard them talking to her in her sleep. Sometimes when someone else was talking, Indigo excused herself&#x2014;her dolls were calling for her. There was so much to do. Black people needed so many things. That&#x2019;s why Indigo didn&#x2019;t tell her mama what all she discussed with her friends. It had nothing to do with Jesus. Nothing at all. Even her mama knew that, and she would shake her head the way folks do when they hear bad news, murmuring, &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s got hold to my child, I swear. She&#x2019;s got too much South in her.&#x201d;<br>The South in her, the land and salt-winds, moved her through Charleston&#x2019;s streets as if she were a mobile sapling, with the gait of a well-loved colored woman whose lover was the horizon in any direction. Indigo imagined tough winding branches growing from her braids, deep green leaves rustling by her ears, doves and macaws flirting above the nests they&#x2019;d fashioned in the secret, protected niches way high up in her headdress. When she wore this Carolinian costume, she knew the cobblestone streets were really polished oyster shells, covered with pine needles and cotton flowers. She made herself, her world, from all that she came from. She looked around her at the wharf. If there was nobody there but white folks, she made them black folks. In the grocery, if the white folks were buying up all the fresh collards and okra, she made them disappear and put the produce on the vegetable wagons that went round to the Colored. There wasn&#x2019;t enough for Indigo in the world she&#x2019;d been born to, so she made up what she needed. What she thought the black people needed.<br>Access to the moon.<br>The power to heal.<br>Daily visits with the spirits.<br>MOON JOURNEYS<br>cartography by Indigo<br>Find an oval stone that&#x2019;s very smooth. Wash it in rosewater, 2 times. Lay it out to dry in the night air where no one goes. When dry, hold stone tightly in the right hand, caress entire face with the left hand. Repeat the same action with the stone in the left hand. Without halting the movement, clasp left stone-filled hand with the right. Walk to a tree that houses a spirit-friend. Sit under the tree facing the direction of your mother&#x2019;s birthplace. Hold your hands between your bosom, tight. Take 5 quick breaths and 3 slow ones. Close your eyes. You are on your way.<br>ALTERNATIVE MODES OF MOON JOURNEYS<br>(Winter travel/Inclement weather)<br>In a thoroughly cleaned bathroom with the window open, burn magnolia incense, preferably, but cinnamon will do. In a handkerchief handled by some other woman in your family (the further back the better), put chamomile, an undamaged birthwort leaf, and Lady&#x2019;s Fern. Tie this with a ribbon from your own hair. Kiss the sachet 3 times. Drop it gently into a tub of warm water that will cover all your body. Place two white burning candles at either end of the tub. Float one fully opened flower in the water. Get in the tub while tickling the water in circles with the petals of the flower. Lie in the tub, with flower over your heart. Close your eyes. You are on your way.<br>Not all black people wanted to go to the moon. But some did.Aunt Haydee had gone to the moon a lot. She&#x2019;d told Indigo about the marvelous parties there were in the very spots the white people put flags and jumped up and down erratically. They never did learn how to dance. Been round black folks all these years and still don&#x2019;t have sense enough to keep in rhythm. But there they were walking on the moon, like nothing ever went on up there. Like women didn&#x2019;t sidle up to lunar hills every month. Like seas of menses could be held back by a rocket launcher. Like the Colored might disappear with the light of the moon.<br>&#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t goin&#x2019; anywhere, are we?&#x201d; Indigo sat some of the dolls on the inside of her thigh. Her very favorites she sat in her lap. Indigo had made every kind of friend she wanted. African dolls filled with cotton root bark, so they&#x2019;d have no more slave children. Jamaican dolls in red turbans, bodies formed with comfrey leaves because they&#x2019;d had to work on Caribbean and American plantations and their bodies must ache and be sore. Then there were the mammy dolls that Indigo labored over for months. They were almost four feet high, with big gold earrings made from dried sunflowers, and tits of uncleaned cotton. They smelled of fennel, peach leaves, wild ginger, wild yams. She still crawled up into their arms when she was unavoidably lonely, anxious that no living black folks would talk to her the way her dolls and Aunt Haydee did.<br>Everybody said she was just too ornery to hold a decent conversation. But that wasn&#x2019;t true. What was true was that Indigo had always had to fight Cypress and Sassafrass just to get them to listen to her. They thought they were so grown. So filled up with white folks&#x2019; ways. They didn&#x2019;t want to hear about the things Aunt Haydee knew. Indigo watched her mother over huge vats of dyes, carrying newly spun yarn from the pots to the lines and back again. Sassafrass, throwing shuttles back and forth and back and forth. Cypress tying off cloth, carrying the cloth to the stairway where she began the appliqu�s the family was famous for. There was too much back and forth going on for anybody to engage little Indigo in conversations about the haints and the Colored. If the rhythm was interrupted, Sassafrass would just stare at the loom. Cypress would look at her work and not know where to start or what gauge her stitches were. Mama would burn herself with some peculiarly tinted boiling water. Everybody would be mad and not working, so Indigo was sent to talk to the dolls. All the dolls in the house became hers. And the worlds Sassafrass wandered in her weaving, and those Cypress conjured through her body, were lost to Indigo, who handled three-way conversations with her cloth companions all alone.<br>A girl- child with her dolls is unlikely to arouse attention anywhere, same as little boys with footballs or Davy Crockett hats. So Indigo would sneak from the place she&#x2019;d been put (the corridor around the back porch), and take her friends out visiting. Old ladies loved for Indigo and Company to pass by. They would give her homemade butter cookies or gingerbread. Th ey offered teas and chocolates, as well as the Scriptures and the legends of their lives. Indigo only had colored dolls and only visited colored ladies. She didn&#x2019;t like Miz Fitzhugh, who fawned over Cypress and Sassafrass like they were &#x2018;most white. No, Mrs. Yancey with the low, secret voice and seventeen million hundred braids was Indigo&#x2019;s friend.

One thing about a Charlestonian female is her way with little things. The delicacy of her manner. The force of ritual in her daily undertakings. So what is most ordinary is made extraordinary. What is hard seems simple. Indigo listened to their tales, the short and long ones, with a mind to make herself a doll whose story that was, or who could have helped out. When her father died, Indigo had decided it was the spirit of things that mattered. The humans come and go.<br>Aunt Haydee said spirits couldn&#x2019;t be gone, or the planet would fall apart.<br>The South in her.<br>Rumor was that Mrs. Yancey had a way with white folks. They couldn&#x2019;t deny her anything. That&#x2019;s what folks said ... that she must honey up to them; leastways, smile a lot. That was the only way the beautiful things she had in her house could be accounted for. Mrs. Yancey couldn&#x2019;t have bought such lace, or that silver tea service. Imagine a colored woman having afternoon tea and crumpets with all that silver. Indigo always carried her doll-friend Miranda over to Mrs. Yancey&#x2019;s. Miranda had better manners than some of her other dolls. Miranda was always clean, too, in a red paisley pinafore and small black sandals. Indigo let Miranda use her parasol to protect her from the sun. What proper young woman would come visiting faint and perspiring? Only some of Indigo&#x2019;s more country dolls would have marched to Mrs. Yancey&#x2019;s with the outdoors all over them.<br>Indigo walked up to Mrs. Yancey&#x2019;s front porch, pulled her slip up, and fussed with the hair sticking out of her braids. She&#x2019;d rinsed her hands off, but re- doing her hair for a short chat seemed to make too much of a regular outing. Besides, Miranda was really dressed up. Indigo had decorated her bonnet with dandelions, and sprayed some of her mama&#x2019;s perfume under her arms and behind her knees. When she was ready, Indigo rang the bell ...</p></p><h2>Isaiah 40-66 (Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching &amp; Preaching)</h2><p><p>The latter half of the sixth century BCE found the Jewish community fragmented and under great strife after having been conquered by the Babylonian armies.

He is a cat; she is a little girl who would like to own him because "he's just my age." Unfortunately, Duncan isn't as enthusiastic about the partnership. And little wonder: Dolores is a miniature cyclone in action, and her boisterousness is odious to Duncan, who definitely does not want to play dress up or do tricks. Discouraged because Duncan seems to prefer older sister Faye, Dolores decides to ignore her cat, with surprising results. Samuels' watercolor illustrations, particularly Duncan's drolly dismayed face, are full of expression and wonderfully complement this rib-tickling story. Faye's deadpan asides as she tries to ignore the chaos will also elicit chuckles. This is a must for cat lovers, but even those who aren't aficionados will find this cat-astrophic tale purr-fectly delightful. Kathleen Brachmann, Highland Park Public Lib . , Ill.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The heroines of Faye and Delores are getting a little older; Delores feels ready to take on the responsibility of owning a cat named Duncan. "He's just my age" is Delores's most persuasive argument. But Dolores's abundant energy and eagerness to be friends with Duncan prove a little daunting to the fat cat; he shows a decided preference for the more sedate Faye. Discouraged, Delores makes a hiding place of two chairs and a blanket, has a tea party with dolls Martha and Mabel (Duncan isn't invited), plays the piano (and doesn't even glance Duncan's way), works at her easel (her pictures aren't of cats). Finally Duncan makes an irresistible overture of friendship and puts his chin on Delores's neck at bedtime. It's a funny first lesson in playing hard-to-get, and Samuel's quirky insights into the siblings' daily lives should have a lot of sistersand brotherslaughing. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cirque Du Freak: The Manga, Vol. 8: Allies of the Night (Cirque Du Freak: The Manga, 8)</h2><p>Vampire prince and &#34;vampaneze&#34; killer Darren Shan faces his worst nightmare yet - school.

Proving that baking with healthy ingredients doesn&#x2019;t have to mean sacrificing flavor or texture, author Jennifer Katzinger created these classic baked-good recipes replacing sugar with honey, coconut palm sugar, maple syrup, and Sucanat; she uses oats and whole grains, such as teff, kamut, spelt, buckwheat, einkorn, barley, and whole-wheat flour to make delicious and more nutritious baked treats. For those who aren&#x2019;t quite ready to go &#x201c;all the way,&#x201d; this book also provides recipe adaptations that incorporate some whole grains into their favorite baked goods.

She is the author of several cookbooks, including <i>Flying Apron&#x2019;s Gluten-Free &amp; Vegan Baking Book</i>, and <i>Gluten-Free and Vegan Pie</i>. She lives in Seattle.This work focuses on whole and ancient grains, including such familiar types as whole wheat and oats and the less familiar einkorn, spelt, kamut, and teff, as well as unrefined natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, coconut palm sugar, and �sucanat. Katzinger&#x2019;s dishes lean toward traditional favorites, such as apple pie, triple-layer chocolate sour cream cake, snickerdoodles, buttermilk biscuits, and pumpkin bread. While each recipe has been specifically developed to suit a particular grain and sweetener, adding a whole new level of complex flavor to a classic, all the recipes offer options for flour substitutions. VERDICT: Interest in whole grains and unrefined sugars continues to grow at a remarkable rate. While not every recipe in Katzinger&#x2019;s latest title is vegan and gluten-free, home bakers who are interested in branching out beyond white sugar and flour will find plenty of healthier alternatives to satisfy their sweet tooth.<br><i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br>. . . if you are excited about the way that whole grain flours change the flavor of a recipe, you should get excited about this cookbook for the way that natural sugars can do the very same.

While the new monarchy can win power, it cannot win hearts in an England that plots for the triumphant return of the House of York. <br><br>Henry&#x2019;s greatest fear is that somewhere a prince is waiting to invade and reclaim the throne. When a young man who would be king leads his army and invades England, Elizabeth has to choose between the new husband she is coming to love and the boy who claims to be her beloved lost brother: the rose of York come home at last.</p><p><p><b> Guest Review of <i>The White Princess</i></b></p><p></p><p><b>By Tracy Chevalier</b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Tracy Chevalier is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>. She was born in Washington, DC but has lived in England all her adult life, and now has dual citizenship. A graduate of the English program at Oberlin College, Ohio, with an MA in creative writing from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, England, she was a reference book editor before turning to writing full-time. She lives in London with her husband and son.</strong></p> <p>How do you solve a problem like the Princes in the Tower? What does a historical novelist do with Edward and Richard, heirs to the British throne who were purportedly locked in the Tower by their uncle and then disappeared so that he could become Richard III? Conspiracy theories have flourished for centuries, but no strong evidence has emerged to solve the mystery. A novelist has any number of possibilities to pursue.</p> <p>In <i>The White Queen</i>, the novel that chronologically precedes <i>The White Princess</i>, Philippa Gregory makes her choice and places their fate in the hands of their feisty mother, Elizabeth Woodville, wife of Edward IV and a key player in the War of the Roses, the dynastic feud among the Plantagenets between the Houses of York and Lancaster. She substitutes a pauper for young Richard, ensuring that the Duke of York gets away. The follow-up to such a dramatic decision inevitably needs to continue this story line. Richard has disappeared. Does he come back?</p> <p>At first, <i>The White Princess</i> seems to tell another story &#x2013; that of Elizabeth of York, the White Queen&#x2019;s daughter, and one-time mistress of Richard III, who on his death becomes the wife of his slayer, the Tudor Henry VII. (Confused yet? I am still reeling at the thought that she was mistress to her uncle!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of the painful transition between York and Tudor monarchies, her strategic marriage to Henry VII the outward expression of York loyalty as demanded by the Tudors.</p> <p>Gregory is known for her retakes on British royal history, viewing the scheming, the power struggles, the battles exclusively from women&#x2019;s points of view, exploring how the Queen or Princess finds her own source of power and influence in the interstices left open by the men. Elizabeth of York is no different, using her beauty, her popularity with the people, her instinctive wiliness and political acumen to bear on Henry VII, with varying results. She may pragmatically have to accept that the Tudors are in the ascendance, but she can see that her distant and paranoid husband is not a natural as a king; she must teach him how to win the love and respect of his subjects, who still view the family of York with affection and nostalgia. </p> <p>Eventually Elizabeth and Henry achieve a kind of marital truce, and grow to love each other, if only for a time. There are plenty of beddings, of ladies-in-waiting with knowing looks, of confinements and wet nurses and babies &#x2013; including, of course, the future Henry VIII, characterized by Gregory even in his boyhood as a sensualist.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, <i>The White Princess</i> is still the story of men, and specifically of the spectre of the lost princes. Does lost Prince Richard return in the form of pretender to the throne Perkin Warbeck (referred to in the novel most often simply as &#x201c;the boy&#x201d;)? Gregory places his identity in Elizabeth&#x2019;s hands, demonstrating the impossible position she is in: acknowledge the boy as her true brother and bring down her husband and any possibility that her sons might become King, or deny him and see her possible brother executed for treason. In this impossible situation, Elizabeth must tread carefully, and Gregory does an expert job of maintaining this tricky balancing act to the very end. Relishing the personality clashes and political machinations of an insecure Tudor court, she makes the current British royal family, with its crystal-clear line of succession, seem very dull indeed.</p>Philippa Gregory is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>, and is a recognized authority on women&#x2019;s history.

Overflowing with solid, practical advice on equipment, fabrics, cutting, basic quilt-block settings, yardage calculation, piecing strategies, even setting up a wonderful workspace, <i>The Art of Classic Quiltmaking</i> aims to allay the trepidations of quilters who long to expand control over their quilting endeavors. With lucid text, hundreds of clear diagrams, and lovely color photos of both antique quilts and their own work, the authors demystify such intimidating concepts as drafting your own patterns, reducing what many quilters fear is a complex mathematical exercise into a more approachable series of simple calculations. Although the authors provide no step-by-step projects (this would, after all, defeat their stated purpose to teach quilters to think for themselves), they do offer detailed explanations on constructing several basic patterns, set-in and curved-seam piecing, quilting the completed product, and finishing techniques. In other words, if you've got a bit of quilt-making experience and want to make a more personal statement with your creations, this volume will show you how to go from raw material to a finished quilt you can be truly proud of. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Harriet Hargrave, a teacher, quilt-shop owner, and author of three previous quilting books, lives near Denver, in Arvada, Colorado.

Escher</h2><p>Seeks to further reader understanding of the perspective artist&#39;s life and works in a volume that combines prints of some of his best-known pieces with numerous unpublished drawings, the artist&#39;s own commentary, and additional observations by the author. space. 60,000 first printing.</p><p>M.C. Escher, the artist who lived from 1898 to 1972, suffers from horrible overexposure. Who hasn't seen the college dorm room posters, postcards, T-shirts, and coffee mugs of such well-worn images as a hand drawing another hand or gothic buildings with never-ending staircases? The mass reproduction of these images has carved a firm place in our popular culture, yet made the work dismissible as modern art. Beyond the familiar images, though, is an immense body of work. <i>The Magic of M.C. Escher</i> covers in depth the graphic illustrations, woodcuts, and lithographs of Escher's career. The artist has always attracted the attention of scientists, mathematicians, and teenage boys everywhere; the popular 1980s game Dungeons &amp; Dragons seems to borrow heavily from the systematic yet mystical quality of his drawing style. With his amazingly repetitive graphic illustration and unflinchingly control of size, shape, and shading, Escher draws like a human computer. One can only wonder what he might have done with today's graphic tools.<p> The book itself is creatively put together, with foldouts, seemingly endless images, and a loving introduction by the director of the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague. The minimal text selections that appear throughout are quotes from Escher himself, many taken from letters to family members. These personal musings give candid insight into what he thought about his peers, his career, and his work: "I really do feel these days like a kind of 'specialist,' and I don't want to 'depend' on my specialty alone, but I also feel it to be my duty to devote myself to that as much as possible." This remarkable book is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the astounding work of the man who could create two-dimensional origami with a pencil. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i></p><p>Adult/High School-This marvelous book is a must for any collection containing works about art and artistic temperament. Not only does it present the wonderfully visionary drawings, paintings, and woodcuts for which Escher is so widely known, but it also includes excerpts from his writings. J. L. Locher, director of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, provides the overview for the volume. Beautiful, full-color foldout copies exhibit some of Escher's most mesmerizing and intriguing works: Metamorphosis II, Day and Night, Up and Down, and Magic Mirror, to name a few. Many of the studies for these works are also included and demonstrate the planned, logical, and mathematical plane upon which Escher's fascinating conundrums are based. The two-page displays for Spirals and Mobius Strip II (Red Ants) are excellent cases in point. The book is filled with magical drawings created throughout the artist's career. Letters to family and friends and parts of lectures given by Escher describe the way he saw the world, his life, and his body of works. He "wandered in enigmas"; was bored by the right-angled boxes forced on mankind by gravity, "our tyrant"; and felt unsure of the "existence of a real, objective space." Even those who claim disinterest in art will find themselves drawn into Escher's exciting, inexplicable, virtual world.-Carol DeAngelo, Kings Park Library, Burke, VA</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>First Prayers (Life Favors(TM))</h2><p>Here is a collection of favorite, familiar prayers selected from Tasha Tudor&#39;s inspirational little book First Prayers, newly reissued in a special Life Favors edition.

And Nadezhda Mandelstam, wife of Osip Mandelstam, one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century, is aptly named, for it is hope alone that seems to have buoyed her strength during very trying times. In this, the first of two volumes of her memoirs, she offers a harrowing account of the last four years she spent with her late husband. She re-creates in terse, stripped-to-the-bone sentences the atmosphere of intense paranoia that enveloped Russia's literary intelligentsia. In 1933, Osip had written a lighthearted satire ridiculing Stalin. It proved to be a 16-line death sentence. Nadezhda recalls the night the secret police came for him: "There was a sharp, unbearably explicit knock on the door. 'They've come for Osip,' I said." He was arrested, interrogated, exiled, and eventually rearrested. Nadezhda chronicles each turn of event, describing her feelings of heartbreak and joy with self-effacing discipline. Not only does Mandelstam write with the vitality and insight of the classic Russian novelists, she is far too selfless to write an account of her own travails. Instead, she acts as witness to a society's. Similarly, although Osip's mind became unbalanced by his ordeal in prison, his spirit remained unbroken; it is this liberating, imaginative force that Nadezhda celebrates in <i>Hope Against Hope</i>. <i>--Lilian Pizzichini, Amazon.co.uk</i>Hope Against Hope was first published in English in 1970. It is Nadezhda Mandelstam&#39;s memoir of her life with Osip, who was first arrested in 1934 and died in Stalin&#39;s Great Purge of 1937-38. Hope Against Hope is a vital eyewitness account of Stalin&#39;s Soviet Union and one of the greatest testaments to the value of literature and imaginative freedom ever written. But it is also a profound inspiration - a love story that relates the daily struggle to keep both love and art alive in the most desperate circumstances.</p><h2>Greek-English Concordance to the New Testament, The</h2><p><p>The Greek-English Concordance to the New Testament is an exhaustive index to three Greek texts: UBS4, Nestle-Aland 26, and the Greek text underlying the New International Version of the Bible.

In fact, Lot 49135 consisted of a nearly complete <i>T. bataar</i>, a close cousin to the most famous animal that ever lived. The fossils now on display in a Manhattan event space had been unearthed in Mongolia, more than 6,000 miles away. At eight-feet high and 24 feet long, the specimen was spectacular, and when the gavel sounded the winning bid was over $1 million.<br><br> Eric Prokopi, a thirty-eight-year-old Floridian, was the man who had brought this extraordinary skeleton to market. A onetime swimmer who spent his teenage years diving for shark teeth, Prokopi's singular obsession with fossils fueled a thriving business hunting, preparing, and selling specimens, to clients ranging from natural history museums to avid private collectors like actor Leonardo DiCaprio. <br><br> But there was a problem. This time, facing financial strain, had Prokopi gone too far? As the <i>T. bataar</i> went to auction, a network of paleontologists alerted the government of Mongolia to the eye-catching lot. As an international custody battle ensued, Prokopi watched as his own world unraveled.<br><br> In the tradition of <i>The Orchid Thief</i>, <i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> is a stunning work of narrative journalism about humans' relationship with natural history and a seemingly intractable conflict between science and commerce. A story that stretches from Florida's Land O' Lakes to the Gobi Desert, <i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> illuminates the history of fossil collecting--a murky, sometimes risky business, populated by eccentrics and obsessives, where the lines between poacher and hunter, collector and smuggler, enthusiast and opportunist, can easily blur. <br><br> In her first book, Paige Williams has given readers an irresistible story that spans continents, cultures, and millennia as she examines the question of who, ultimately, owns the past.</p><p><b>Paige Williams</b> is a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker </i>and a Mississippi native<i>. </i>A National Magazine Award winner for feature writing, she has had her journalism anthologized in various volumes of the <i>Best American</i> series, including <i>The Best American Magazine Writing </i>and<i> The Best American Crime Writing</i>. She is the Laventhol/Newsday Visiting Professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, and has taught at schools including the University of Mississippi, New York University, the Missouri School of Journalism, and, at M.I.T., in the Knight Science Journalism program. Williams has been a fellow of The MacDowell Colony and was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard. At <i>The New Yorker</i>, she has written about suburban politics in Detroit, the death penalty in Alabama, paleoanthropology in South Africa, and the theft of cultural palimony from the Tlingit peoples of Alaska."Paige Williams is that rare reporter who burrows into a subject until all of its dimensions, all of its darkened corners and secret chambers, are illuminated. With <i>The Dinosaur Artist</i>, she has done more than reveal a gripping true crime story; she has cast light on everything from obsessive fossil hunters to how the earth evolved. This is a tremendous book."&#x2015;<b><i>David Grann, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> is a breathtaking feat of writing and reporting: a strange, irresistible, and beautifully written story steeped in natural history, human nature, commerce, crime, science, and politics. It's at once laugh-out-loud funny and deeply sobering. I was blown away by the depth of its characters, its vivid details, and Paige Williams' incredible command of the facts. Bottom line: this is an extraordinary debut by one of the best nonfiction writers we've got."&#x2015;<b><i>Rebecca Skloot, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></i></b><br><br>"What began for [Williams] as the tale of an unusual court case involving a rogue fossil hunter unspools in this book into a wide-ranging examination of the ways that commercialism, ambition, politics and science collide... As a reader, being given entry by Williams into this underworld, privy to the secret knowledge of a black market, is a thrill.... The strange underground world Prokopi inhabits inevitably brings us in contact with some serious oddballs, each of whom is introduced by Williams with the economy and evocative precision of a haiku.... the book's most memorable character may be Mongolia itself, a rugged physical and political terrain that defies easy generalization."&#x2015;<b><i><i>New York Times</i><br></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> is a tale that has everything: passion, science, politics, intrigue, and, of course, dinosaurs. Paige Williams is a wonderful storyteller."&#x2015;<b><i>Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Sixth Extinction</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Dinosaur Artist</i> is a triumph. With peerless prose and sharp-eyed reporting, Paige Williams weaves a story that, even as it spans continents and transcends geological epochs, is deeply anchored in the passion and hubris of a rich cast of characters. Captivating, funny, and profound, it is easily one of the strongest works of non-fiction in years."&#x2015;<b><i>Ed Yong, staff writer, <i>The Atlantic</i>; <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>I Contain Multitudes</i></i></b><br><br>"Vivid storytelling....

Hamilton&#x2019;s superbly imagined, cunningly plotted interstellar adventures are conceived on a staggeringly epic scale and filled with fully realized human and alien characters as complex as they are engaging. No mere world builder, Hamilton creates entire universes&#x2013;and he does so with irresistible flair and intelligence. His previous novel, the acclaimed Pandora&#x2019;s Star, introduced the Intersolar Commonwealth, a star-spanning civilization of the twenty-fourth century. Robust, peaceful, and confident, the Commonwealth dispatched a ship to investigate the mystery of a disappearing star, only to inadvertently unleash a predatory alien species that turned on its liberators, striking hard, fast, and utterly without mercy. <br><br>The Prime are the Commonwealth&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Coexistence is impossible with the technologically advanced aliens, who are genetically hardwired to exterminate all other forms of life. Twenty-three planets have already fallen to the invaders, with casualties in the hundreds of millions. And no one knows when or where the genocidal Prime will strike next.<br><br>Nor are the Prime the only threat. For more than a hundred years, a shadowy cult, the Guardians of Selfhood, has warned that an alien with mind-control abilities impossible to detect or resist&#x2013;the Starflyer&#x2013;has secretly infiltrated the Commonwealth. Branded as terrorists, the Guardians and their leader, Bradley Johansson, have been hunted by relentless investigator Paula Myo. But now evidence suggests that the Guardians were right all along, and that the Starflyer has placed agents in vital posts throughout the Commonwealth&#x2013;agents who are now sabotaging the war effort. Is the Starflyer an ally of the Prime, or has it orchestrated a fight to the death between the two species for its own advantage?<br><br>Caught between two deadly enemies, one a brutal invader striking from without, the other a remorseless cancer killing from within, the fractious Commonwealth must unite as never before.<br><br>This will be humanity&#x2019;s finest hour&#x2013;or its last gasp.</p><p>Peter F. Hamilton is the author of numerous short stories and novels, including Pandora&#x2019;s Star, Fallen Dragon, and the acclaimed epic Night&#x2019;s Dawn trilogy (The Reality Dysfunction, The Neutronium Alchemist, and The Naked God). Hamilton lives in England.Right from the start, there was something about the investigation that made Lieutenant Renne Kampasa uneasy. The first little qualm came sliding up out of her subconscious when she saw the victim&#x2019;s loft apartment. She&#x2019;d been inside loft apartments just like it a hundred times before. It was the kind of plush metropolitan pad that a group of funky TSI soap characters usually lived in: beautiful single people with well-paying jobs that gave them most of the day off so they could enjoy a floor space of around five hundred square meters as they lounged around in an extravagant decor provided by overpriced interior designers. The kind of scenario completely divorced from real life but full of dramatic or comic potential for the scriptwriters. Yet here she was, a day after the Guardians&#x2019; shotgun message that denounced President Elaine Doi as a Starflyer agent, being shown into just such an apartment on the top �oor of a refurbished factory block in Daroca, the capital city of Arevalo. The massive open-plan lounge had a wide sunny balcony that looked out over the Caspe River which flowed through the heart of the city. Like all the capitals of successful phase one space planets, Daroca was a rich montage of parks, elegant buildings, and broad streets stretching away to the horizon. Under the planet&#x2019;s bronze-shaded morning sunlight it glimmered with a sharp coronal hue, adding to the panorama&#x2019;s graceful appeal. <br><br>Renne shook her head in mild disbelief at the fabulous view. Even with the decent salary the navy paid her, she could never afford the rent on this. And it was currently being paid by three first-life girls, all under twenty-five. <br><br>One of them was showing Renne and Tarlo in: Catriona Saleeb, a small twenty-two-year-old, with long curly black hair, wearing a simple green dress with strong geometric lilac stripes&#x2013;except Renne knew the dress was a Fon, which put its price tag over a thousand Earth dollars, and the girl was using it as a casual housedress. Renne&#x2019;s e-butler printed up Saleeb&#x2019;s file in her virtual vision; she was a junior member of the Morishi Grand Family, working at a bank in Daroca&#x2019;s large financial district. <br><br>Her two friends were Trisha Marina Halgarth, who had a product placement job at Veccdale, a Halgarth subsidiary that designed chic domestic systems, and Isabella Halgarth, who&#x2019;d taken a job at a contemporary art gallery in town. They fitted the whole profile: three bachelorettes sharing a place in the city, having fun together while they waited for their true careers to launch, or husbands of equal wealth and status to materialize and carry them off to a merged trust fund mansion to produce their contracted quota of children. <br><br>"This is one great place you&#x2019;ve got here," Tarlo said as they made their way into the lounge. <br><br>Catriona turned and gave him a smile that was a lot more than simple politeness. "Thanks, it&#x2019;s a family place so we get it cheap."<br><br>"Plenty of wild parties, huh."<br><br>Her smile became teasing. "Maybe."<br><br>Renne shot him an exasperated look; they were supposed to be on duty, not hitting on potential witnesses. He just grinned back, perfect white teeth gleaming out of his handsome tanned face. She&#x2019;d seen for herself just how successful that grin could be in the clubs and bars around Paris. <br><br>Catriona took them over to the kitchen section, which was separated from the lounge by a broad marble-topped breakfast bar. The kitchen was ultra�modern, equipped with every convenience gadget possible, all built in to swan-white egg-shaped wall modules. Somehow, Renne couldn&#x2019;t imagine it being used for much actual cooking, not even by the complicated-looking chef bots. <br><br>The two other girls were sitting on stools at the bar. <br><br>"Trisha Marina Halgarth?" Renne asked. <br><br>"That&#x2019;s me." One of the girls got to her feet. She had a heart-shaped face and light olive skin with small, dark green butterfly-wing OCtattoos flowing back from each hazel eye. She wore an oversize white toweling robe like defensive armor; she kept clutching at the fluffy fabric, pulling it tighter around her. Her bare feet had silver rings around each toe. <br><br>"We&#x2019;re from navy intelligence," Tarlo said. "Lieutenant Kampasa and I are investigating what happened to you." <br><br>"You mean, how gullible I was," she snapped. <br><br>"Easy, babe," Isabella Halgarth said. Her arm went around Trisha&#x2019;s shoulders. "These are the good guys."<br>She stood to face the investigators. <br><br>Renne found herself having to look up slightly; Isabella was several centimeters taller than she, almost Tarlo&#x2019;s height. She was dressed in very tight jeans that showed off her legs. Her long blond hair had been gathered into a single tail that reached down to her hips. It was an image of casual elegance. <br><br>Tarlo&#x2019;s grin had broadened. Renne wanted to push him against a wall and shout a warning about professional conduct, wagging her finger in his face for emphasis. Instead, she did her best to ignore the mating dance appraisals going on all around her, and said, "I&#x2019;ve investigated several similar cases, Ms. Halgarth. In my experience, the victim is rarely gullible. The Guardians have developed a very sophisticated operation over the years."<br> <br>"Years!" Catriona snorted. "And you haven&#x2019;t caught them yet?"<br><br>Renne kept her polite expression in place. "We believe we are close to a resolution."<br> <br>The three girls exchanged doubtful looks. Trisha sat down again, gripping at her robe. <br><br>"I know it&#x2019;s unpleasant for you," Tarlo said. "But if you could start by telling me the man&#x2019;s name." His grin mellowed to sympathetic encouragement. <br><br>Trisha gave a reluctant nod. "Sure. Howard Liang." She smiled feebly. "I don&#x2019;t suppose that&#x2019;s his real name?"<br> <br>"No," Tarlo said. "But that identity will have created a lot of data within Daroca&#x2019;s cybersphere. Our forensic software teams will pull out a great many associated files. We can check on the false identity information, where it was inserted, possibly who was involved forging it. Every little bit helps."<br> <br>"How did you meet?" Renne asked. <br><br>"Party. We get to quite a lot of them." She glanced at her two girlfriends for support. <br><br>"This is a great city," Isabella said. "Daroca is a wealthy planet; people here have the money and time to play." Her eyes gave Tarlo an amused glance. "Trish and I are Dynasty, Catriona is a Grandee. What can I say? We&#x2019;re highly desirable."<br> <br>"Was Howard Liang wealthy?" Renne asked. <br><br>"He didn&#x2019;t have a trust fund," Trisha said, then colored. "Well, he said he didn&#x2019;t. His family was supposed to come from Velaines. He said he was a couple of years out of his first rejuve. I liked him."<br><br>"Where did he work?"<br><br>"On the commodities desk at Ridgeon Financial. God, I don&#x2019;t even know if that&#x2019;s true." She pressed her free hand against her forehead, rubbing hard. "I don&#x2019;t know how old he really was. I know nothing about him at all. That&#x2019;s what I hate most about this. Not that he stole my author certificate, not that he gave me a memory wipe. Just . . . being taken in like that. It&#x2019;s so stupid. Our family security office sends us enough warnings. I never thought they ap�plied to me." <br><br>"Please," Tarlo said. "Don&#x2019;t blame yourself. These guys are very professional. Hell, I&#x2019;d probably get taken in by them. Now, when did you last see him?"<br><br>"Three days ago. We went out for the evening. I&#x2019;d been invited to the Bourne club, there was some event, a new drama series launch. We had a meal afterward, then I came home. I think. The apartment domestic array says I got in at five in the morning. I don&#x2019;t remember anything after dinner. Is that when they did it?" <br><br>"Possibly," Renne said. "Did Mr. Liang share his apartment with anyone?"<br><br>"No. He lived by himself. I met a couple of his friends; I think they were from Ridgeon. We only went out for a couple of weeks. Enough for me to drop my guard, I guess." She shook her head angrily. "I hate this. The whole Commonwealth thinks I believe the President is an alien. I&#x2019;ll never be able to face anyone at work again. I&#x2019;ll have to go back to Solidade and get my face changed and use another name." <br><br>"That would probably help," Tarlo said gently. "But before that we need to run some tests on you. There&#x2019;s a medical forensic team waiting down in the lobby. They can do this in a clinic, or here, whichever you&#x2019;re comfortable with."<br> <br>"Do it here," Trisha said. "Just get it over with."<br> <br>"Of course. Another team will sweep his apartment."<br> <br>"What do you expect to find there?" Isabella asked. <br><br>"We&#x2019;ll pin down his DNA, of course," Renne told her. "Who knows what else we&#x2019;ll uncover, especially if they used it as their base. And we&#x2019;ll pull his files from Ridgeon Financial&#x2019;s personnel records, which I&#x2019;d like you to verify. It would help to have a picture of him."<br> <br>"Won&#x2019;t he have had reprofiling by now?" Catriona asked. <br><br>"Yes. But it&#x2019;s his background we&#x2019;ll be focusing our investigation on, his past. That&#x2019;s where the clues to his origin are. You must understand, we have to crack the whole Guardian organization open; it&#x2019;s the only way to bring Liang to justice. We&#x2019;re not pursuing him singularly."<br> <br>They spent another twenty minutes in the loft apartment, taking statements from the girls, th...</p><h2>Enzymes: The Fountain of Life</h2><p>Enzymes are the essential biochemical units of all forms of life.

Wilfrid lives next to a retirement home, filled with folks like "Mrs. Jordan who played the organ" and "Mr. Hosking who told him scary stories." But his favorite old person is 96-year-old Miss Nancy. Everyone says Miss Nancy has lost her memory, and despite the fact that Wilfrid doesn't even know what a memory is, by accident he helps her find it. Mem Fox's original take on the capacity of children to help the old remember is especially notable for its non-patronizing focus on old people.

Textbooks tell us that it came about as a result of a rediscovery of the ideas and ideals of classical Greece and Rome. But now bestselling historian Gavin Menzies makes the startling argument that in the year 1434, China&#x2014;then the world's most technologically advanced civilization&#x2014;provided the spark that set the European Renaissance ablaze. From that date onward, Europeans embraced Chinese intellectual ideas, discoveries, and inventions, all of which form the basis of western civilization today.</p><p>Florence and Venice of the early fifteenth century were hubs of world trade, attracting traders from across the globe. Based on years of research, this marvelous history argues that a Chinese fleet&#x2014;official ambassadors of the emperor&#x2014;arrived in Tuscany in 1434, where they were received by Pope Eugenius IV in Florence. The delegation presented the influential pope with a wealth of Chinese learning from a diverse range of fields: art, geography (including world maps that were passed on to Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan), astronomy, mathematics, printing, architecture, steel manufacturing, military weaponry, and more. This vast treasure trove of knowledge spread across Europe, igniting the legendary inventiveness of the Renaissance, including the work of such geniuses as da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, and more.</p><p>In <em>1434</em>, Gavin Menzies combines this long-overdue historical reexamination with the excitement of an investigative adventure. He brings the reader aboard the remarkable Chinese fleet as it sails from China to Cairo and Florence, and then back across the world. Erudite and brilliantly reasoned, <em>1434</em> will change the way we see ourselves, our history, and our world.</p></p><p><p>Gavin Menzies is the bestselling author of <em>1421: The Year China Discovered America</em>; <em>1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance</em>; and <em>The Lost Empire of Atlantis: History's Greatest Mystery Revealed</em>. He served in the Royal Navy between 1953 and 1970. His knowledge of seafaring and navigation sparked his interest in the epic voyages of Chinese admiral Zheng He. Menzies lives in London.</p>In Menzies's 1421, the amateur historian advanced a highly controversial hypothesis, that the Chinese discovered America; in this follow-up, he credits the Renaissance not to classical Greek and Roman ideals (a "Eurocentric view of history") but again to the Chinese. His thesis in both works is based on the seven (historically undisputed) voyages undertaken by a large Chinese sailing fleet between 1405 and 1433; while it is known that they traveled as far as east Africa, Menzies believes that they landed in Italy and sent a delegation to the Council of Venice, held in Florence in 1439. There, they provided the knowledge and technique-introducing the painter Alberti, for instance, to the methods of perspective drawing-that sparked the Renaissance. Menzies sets the stage by recapitulating arguments from his first book, including the ingenious method for calculating longitude that Chinese navigators may have used. Though Menzies writes engagingly, his assumption that the Chinese fleet landed a delegation in Florence is highly speculative, and hardly substantiated by any facts (Alberti could just have easily learned perspective from classical sources; the Greeks knew about the relationship between perception of length and distance in the 1st Century BCE). <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their meager distractions include a violin&#x2014;as well as, before long, the beautiful daughter of the local tailor.<br><br>But it is when the two discover a hidden stash of Western classics in Chinese translation that their re-education takes its most surprising turn. While ingeniously concealing their forbidden treasure, the boys find transit to worlds they had thought lost forever. And after listening to their dangerously seductive retellings of Balzac, even the Little Seamstress will be forever transformed. <br><br>From within the hopelessness and terror of one of the darkest passages in human history, Dai Sijie has fashioned a beguiling and unexpected story about the resilience of the human spirit, the wonder of romantic awakening and the magical power of storytelling.</p><p>"Dai Sijie's debut novella is an unexpected miracle--a delicate, and often hilarious, tale set amid the ham-fisted brutalities of the Cultural Revolution."<br> --Mark Rozzo, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"Part fairy tale, part political allegory, <i>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</i> seduces the reader into its world . . . This is a very wise little story of love and illusion . . . a shrewd commentary on knowledge and power, and an affirmation that the pen is mightier than the sword--or the dollar . . . Dai Sijie's novel is a tribute to art's power of transformation."<br> --Helen Mitsios, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"Dai Sijie gives the rest of the world a glimpse into that dark place where the human spirit continues, against all the odds, to shine its light into the farthest corners."<br> --Bella English, <i>Boston Globe<br><br></i>"A wonderful novel . . . Dai Sijie demonstrates that, in a time when freedom is in short supply, lessons about liberty from another time or tradition . . . can be an inspiration to those who wish to escape . . . . If we look to the tradition of Balzac and his contemporaries, we are left with some hope that these young men and the Little Seamstress will reappear in some future novel . . . Even if they come back by some other name, as Balzac's characters sometimes do, we will recognize them by their simplicity and strength, and by their harmonious complexity, formed by detailed layering and exquisite craftsmanship, like a beautifully tailored garment."<br>--Stephanie Hull, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>I opened Dai <i>Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress </i>expecting a book that would be at best earnest and well meaning; the tale of two city boys, sent to the provinces in 1971 during the Cultural Revolution, sounds like your standard-issue Chinese tract in fictive form. Yet make no mistake: This is a funny, touching, sly and altogether delightful novel...ironic and wistful....Though salted with wit and slapstick humor, <i>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</i> is basically a romance, a novel about the power of art to enlarge our imaginations, no matter what the circumstances . . . If one novel about Mao's China can be as terrific as this one, there must be others as well."<br>--Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"A simple story, seductively told . . . What marks it out is the way it touches and lifts up the beauty of human experience far beyond the mountains of Western China in which the story is set." <br>--Justin Hill, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"A mesmerizing story, classic and new, fabulist and gritty in its realism, full of riches as in the best of tales. My imagination and heart were seized."<br>--Amy Tan<br><br>"Few if any books that are mailed to me strike me as worth recommending. I recommend this book highly. I myself was also secretly introduced to Western cutlure through literature during the Cultural Revolution when I first read a hand copied Chinese translation of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Dai Sijie does an excellent job showing this experience. Anyone who wants to understand how Western art and literature influences the Chinese mindset should read this book."<br>--Anchee Min author of <b><i>Red Azalea </i></b>and <b><i>Becoming Madame Mao</i></b>Born in China in 1954, Dai Sijie is a filmmaker who was himself &#x201c;re-educated&#x201d; between 1971 and 1974. <br>He left China in 1984 for France, where he has lived and worked ever since.

She neatly sums up the problems in each of her three short marriages: Mickey Rooney was a blatant womanizer; Artie Shaw was cool and overbearing; Frank Sinatra (the two were the loves of each other's lives) was as jealous as she, leading to drunken marathon fights. Gardner also sketches a creepy portrait of Howard Hughes, who for years stopped at no machination in an unsuccessful attempt to bed and marry her. A shy woman who used drink to feel comfortable socially, Gardner seems very likable, down-home, spontaneous and sadly derogatory toward her intelligence, acting abilities--and even her beauty. Of the seven included "eulogies" from friends and colleagues, Stephen Birmingham's best captures the joy and tragedy of Gardner's life.

Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club's Good Cook Club. Winner of a 1998 IACP/Julia Child Cookbook Award.</p><p>There's a world of grilled food out there, and Steven Raichlen seems to have wandered through all of it the State Department deemed "safe." No Afghanistan, for instance. No Iraq. But not to worry. Any decent conflict produces refugees, and nothing travels quite so easily as your own way with food. So Raichlen availed himself of restaurant cooks in this country where and when he had to--all to get right down to the meat of it.<p> "Barbecue," as Raichlen points out, is a confusing word in the U.S. because it means so many things, up to and including slow-cooked barbecue with its smoky aroma and succulent charm. The word stands in for the tool itself. It's an event. It's food. It's the style of cooking. </p><p> To set the record straight, 90 percent of Raichlen's recipes (there are more than 500, from drinks to appetizers to main courses, salads, and desserts, not to mention sauces and dry rubs) are for grilled foods--and that can mean cooked on a hot grill, a moderately hot grill, a relatively cool grill, or an indirectly heated grill (which is more like an oven than a grill, but that's another story). Raichlen gets into some barbecue recipes: pork ribs, for example, or beef brisket, or chicken. But the reader would be better advised to look elsewhere for instruction specific to barbecue (cooking for long periods of time with smoke at low heat). The results will be more appealing.</p><p> But grilling. Well, Steven Raichlen has a lock on grilling. This book is absolutely overwhelming it is so deep, so comprehensive, so far-reaching, so all-encompassing. This isn't one of those chefs with taste memories from a grill in Barbados, now let's try to jazz it up and be clever kind of books. No. This is a book by an author who squatted in the market in Vietnam eating whole grilled eggs dipped in a special sauce, and he gives you the recipe and the technique. You could go set up your own egg-grilling stand in a Vietnamese market with this book. You could open shop in Central or South America. Or North Africa. Or the Middle East. Or Korea. Anywhere food is grilled--be that meat, poultry, seafood, or vegetables--Raichlen's been there and brought home the goods. The real goods.</p><p> But there's another angle, too. Raichlen freely shares his travel experiences with you, making this a valuable travel book. And he freely shares his techniques, too, telling you exactly how he learned and all about who taught him. His book is worth it just for the section on salads and sauces. Start there and work your way from cover to cover. Hey, take all summer trying. You won't regret it. Your life will never be the same. You'll probably find yourself thinking that if one grill in the backyard is good, two is no doubt better. See? You're already on your way.

They are married and live in Washington, D.C., with their son, Theodore.In 1931, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin gave a speech explaining that his country needed to industrialize rapidly to avoid repeating an old pattern: Russia being beaten because of its backwardness. He walked his audience through a litany of invaders: Mongol khans, Turkish beys, Swedish feudal lords, Polish and Lithuanian gentry, British and French capitalists, Japanese barons. "They beat her," he concluded, "because to do so was profitable and could be done with impunity." <p>In their brilliant study of Vladimir Putin's rule over contemporary Russia, Peter Baker and Susan Glasser come back again and again to the current Russian president's eerily Stalinist rhetoric about the need to avoid looking weak so as not to be beaten (whether by oligarchs or Chechen rebels) and his resulting Bolshevik-like obsession with control. Putin's aim has been to pursue economic growth and re-create a strong state in order to rebuild Russia's place in the world. </p><p>Baker and Glasser, whose nearly four years as The Washington Post's correspondents in Moscow coincided with most of Putin's first term as president, provide an extraordinarily comprehensive account of Russian politics and society, illuminating everything from the machinations in the Kremlin's inner corridors to life in the provinces. The picture they paint is not a pretty one. They chronicle not only government lies and incompetence but the overwhelming problems of AIDS, alcohol, military hazing and environmental degradation. </p><p>At the heart of this tale is "Project Putin," the president's crusade to remove all challenges to his authority. It includes the elimination of independent television networks and elections for regional governors, as well as the jailing of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the destruction of his private company, Yukos. To get a sense of how obsessive Putin can be, consider his behavior in the run-up to his reelection in 2004. After he ensured that he faced no serious opposition, Putin's only fear was that turnout might be below the 50-percent threshold required to validate the results -- which would trigger a new election, making Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who had served as Boris Yeltsin's finance minister, acting president in the interim. So Putin fired Kasyanov and gave the job to Mikhail Fradkov, who was unknown and unthreatening. </p><p>Ironically, despite his periodic denunciations of the collapse of the Soviet Union as a national tragedy (a collapse that brought freedom to millions), Putin would not be where he is today absent those historic events. During the Soviet period, he seemed destined to remain a mid-level KGB functionary. But after the collapse, he used connections built while working for his former law professor, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, to begin his rise. Putin became head of the FSB (the KGB's domestic successor) in 1998, prime minister in 1999 and Yeltsin's chosen successor as president in 2000.</p><p>During the Yeltsin years, Russia had experienced a traumatic decline in its economic, political and military stature and fallen from the front rank of great powers. Despite both Russian and Western efforts to help build democracy in the aftermath of Soviet rule, the average Russian citizen equated the 1990s less with freedom than with chaos. While Putin's popularity at home (and for a while, abroad) stemmed from the stability he brought to Russian life, that stability has come at a steep price.</p><p>Encapsulating much of Baker and Glasser's views of modern Russia is the gut-wrenching story of the events of Sept. 1, 2004, in School No. 1 in Beslan, when militants held hostage an estimated 1,200 schoolchildren and adults; the official death toll exceeded 300. We see the bravery of the hostages, including 15-year-old Kazbek Dzaragasov, who escaped at the start only to go back in to try to save his 8-year-old sister, Agunda. But we also see the callousness of the captors, the incompetence of the security forces and, above all, the dishonesty of the government. Putin's behavior in this crisis, write Baker and Glasser, was typical: "long silence followed by a brief, heavily staged appearance shown over and over on television, a pattern of official deception by his government, and finally a lengthy if overdue presidential speech filled with tough talk about hunting down the perpetrators even if it required more trade-offs of Russia's already fragile freedoms."</p><p>Methodical in its approach, as riveting as a novel in its depiction of modern Russian life, Kremlin Rising is a powerful indictment of Putin's years as president. In his obsessive quest for control and a stronger Russian state, Putin is undermining Russia's long-term future just as Soviet leaders did in their own repressive days. Given how often President Bush has spoken of Putin's commitment to democracy, one can only hope that this book is on the must-read list for those vacationing in Crawford, Tex., this summer.</p><p>Reviewed by James M.

We learn:<br><ul><li>How a fearful thought translates into physiological changes that predispose us to illness</li></ul><ul><li>How to tell true fear (the kind that arises from a genuine threat) from false fear (which triggers stress responses that undermine health)</li><li>How to tune in to the voice of courage inside&#x2014;our &#x201c;Inner Pilot Light&#x201d;</li><li>How to reshape our relationship to uncertainty so that it&#x2019;s no longer something to dread, but a doorway to new possibilities</li></ul><ul><li>What our fears can teach us about who we really are</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the intersection of science and spirituality, The Fear Cure identifies the Four Fearful Assumptions that lie at the root of all fears&#x2014;from the sense that we&#x2019;re alone in the universe to the belief that we can&#x2019;t handle losing what we love&#x2014;and shifts them into Four Courage-Cultivating Truths that pave our way to not only physical well-being, but profound awakening. Using exercises from a wide range of mind-body practices and spiritual traditions, Dr. Rankin teaches us how to map our own courage-cultivating journey, write a personalized Prescription for Courage, and step into a more authentic life.</p><p><b>Lissa Rankin, M.D.</b>, author of the New York Times bestseller Mind Over Medicine, is a mind-body medicine physician, author, speaker, and founder of the Whole Health Medicine Institute, a training program for physicians and other health-care providers. Passionate about what makes people healthy and what predisposes them to illness, she studies how healers might better care for patients and how patients might better care for themselves. She is on a mission to heal health care, help patients play a more active role in healing themselves, learn from indigenous cultures about anomalous forms of healing, and encourage the health-care industry to embrace and facilitate, rather than resist, such miracles. She is also passionate about how spiritual growth translates into physical healing and how awakening collective consciousness heals us all.<br> Website: lissarankin.com&#x201c;Finally, a brilliant teacher from the medical community takes a hard look at the omnipresence of fear in our culture as a major cause of illness in our contemporary world, while simultaneously offering a plethora of highly specific suggestions for eradicating this &#x2018;disease producing mindset.&#x2019; I love the exceptionally honest and personal approach that Dr. Rankin provides throughout the pages of this powerful book. Fear is much more than the scary feeling you experience inside when you get too close to the edge of the cliff, it is a way of living in which your subconscious mind is being programmed from your earliest years to avoid any and all risks. This programming invites sickness not only of the body, but the mind, and especially the soul. My friend Lissa Rankin has created a book that will show you how to cultivate the courage to live life fearlessly. It is medicine for the soul as well as the body. I love love love this book.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014; <b>Dr.</b><b>Wayne W.

These chronic fears, which result in stress that undermines health and leads to disease and death, are responsible for up to 90 percent of all doctor visits. A valuable palliative to combat debilitating stress is provided in Dr. Lissa Rankin&#x2019;s new book, <i>The Fear Cure.</i> This empowering compendium on the psychobiological impacts of fear offers highly effective personal management techniques to shift consciousness and transform chronic fear into health-enhancing behavior.

As always, the tale includes a vivid group of characters on two legs and four: Mrs. Pickering and her three stately Basset hounds, James himself, and Debbie, the self-possesed stray cat who makes a special contribution to Christmas at the Pickering house. This is one of James Herriot's own favorite stories, and it is sure to be one of yours.<br></p><p>K-4 A well illustrated, but very slight story from James Herriot's seemingly unending supply of anecdotes as a country vet. This is part of a series including Moses the Kitten (1984) and Only One Woof (1985, both St. Martin's Pr) . The paintings are rich in the color and texture of the Yorkshire setting, but they cannot offset the fact that there isn't much to the story itself. It concerns a rather mysterious and independent cat who frequently visits Mrs. Pickering's house. One Christmas before the cat dies, she brings her small kitten to Mrs. Pickering for care. There amongst Mrs. Pickering's two sedate basset hounds, she thrives. Later Mrs. Pickering delights in showing Herriot an amazing feat: unlike the hounds, the kitten retrieves a ball tossed by her. To Mrs. Pickering it is the best Christmas present she has ever had. It's unlikely that children will be that impressed.Judith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Lib .<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The noted veterinarian and storyteller recalls a Christmas morning when he was summoned to the home of Mrs. Pickering. Usually he called on her Basset hounds, but this time the woman's concern was for a mother cat that was sick. The cat, a stray that occasionally hung around at Mrs. Pickering's, had brought her kitten with her and then died. Mrs. Pickering keeps the kitten, which grows up to become a "retriever-cat," fetching balls and setting them at his mistress's feet. Portraits of Mrs. Pickering and her animals, elegantly executed by Brown, round out this story about the quiet joy of the miracle of birth. It portrays a holiday spirit usually associated with the past: that the humblest of pleasures are the ones most keenly felt.

Applying the same objective criteria to legal and illegal substances, an argument is made that legality is not a clear measure for harm. Tackling a variety of questions, such as <i>Which is more harmful&#x2014;Ecstasy or alcohol? Can addiction be cured? and Does the "War on Drugs" have serious unintended effects that can hurt children?</i>, this analysis equips readers with the ability to make educated decisions regarding drugs both personally and in their communities. Broadening the scope of the discussion, a framework is explored for formulating national drug policies that will minimize a myriad of harms&#x2014;social, medical, criminal, financial, and environmental. <br></p><p><p><b>David Nutt</b> is a writer and a psychiatrist in the field of psychopharmacology.

They take over the sky and hide that pulsing swollen moon that is clearing its throat above them. The slow trickle of its light is there&#x2014;but any possible glimmer is hidden, invisible behind the clouds that have rolled in low and bloated and so very full. Soon the clouds will open up and pour down a heavy summer rain, so very soon, because they, too, are full of what they must do, full to the point of bursting, so very full that they, too, must work to hold back the flood that absolutely must come, and soon.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon&#x2014;but not now, not yet. They must wait, too, swelling with the power of all that is growing in them, the true and blinding cur- rent of what will come, of what must come when it is right, when it is beyond necessary and into the true shape of this moment, when it forges the real and necessary skeleton of <i>now</i>&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> But that time is not yet here, not yet. And so the clouds glower and bunch and wait, letting the need build, and the tension grows with it. It will be soon; it has to be soon. In only a few moments these dark and silent clouds will shatter the silence of the night with the unbearable bright omnipotence of their might and blast the darkness into flickering shards&#x2014;and then, only then, the release will come.<br> &nbsp;<br> The clouds will open up and all the tension of holding in so much weight will flow out in the pure bliss of letting go, and the clean joy of it will pour out and flood the world with its oh-so-happy gift of light and liberation.<br> &nbsp;<br> That moment is near, so tantalizingly close&#x2014;but it is not yet. And so the clouds wait for that just-right moment, growing their darkness, swelling even bigger and heavier with shadow, until they absolutely must let go.<br> &nbsp;<br> And here below, in the lightless night? Here on the ground, in the stark pool of shadow these clouds have made with their moon-sheltering sky-hogging sulkiness? What can this be, over there, skyless and dark, sliding through the night so very full and ready and waiting, just like the clouds? And it is waiting, whatever its dark self might be; it waits tense and coiled and watching for that perfect moment to do what it will, what it must, what it has always done. And that moment skitters closer on little mice feet as if it too knows what must come and fears it, and feels the terror of the stalking moment of rightness that is even now pattering up close, closer&#x2014;until it is right there behind you, looking at your neck and nearly tasting the warm flutter of those tender veins and thinking, <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> And a shattering blast of lightning shreds the dark night and shows a large and soft-looking man scuttling across the ground, as if he, too, has felt the dark breath so close behind. Thunder booms and lightning flashes again and the figure is closer, juggling a laptop and a manila folder as he fumbles for keys and disappears into darkness again as the lightning ends. One more burst of lightning; the man is very close now, clutching his burden and holding a car key in the air. And he is gone again in black stillness. There is sudden silence, a complete hush, as if nothing anywhere is breathing and even the darkness is holding its breath&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then there comes a sudden rush of wind and a last hammer of thunder and the whole world cries out, <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Now</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> And all that must happen in this dark summer night begins to happen. The skies open up and let go of their burden, the world begins to breathe again, and here in the newly wet darkness other tensions flex and uncoil so very slowly, carefully, reaching their soft sharp tendrils out toward the fumbling, clownlike figure now scrabbling to unlock his car in this sudden rain. The car&#x2019;s door swings open, the laptop and folder thump onto the seat, and then the soft and doughy man slides in behind the wheel, slams the door, and takes a deep breath as he wipes the water from his face. And he smiles, a smile of small triumph, something he does a lot these days. Steve Valentine is a happy man; things have gone his way a lot lately and he thinks they have gone his way again tonight. For Steve Valentine, life is very good.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is also almost over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steve Valentine is a clown. Not a buffoon, not a happy caricature of inept normality. He is a real clown, who runs ads in the local papers and hires out for children&#x2019;s parties. Unfortunately, it is not the bright laughter of childish innocence that he lives for, and his sleight of hand has gotten somewhat out of hand. He has been arrested and released twice when parents pointed out to the police that you don&#x2019;t really need to take a child into a dark closet to show him balloon animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had to let him go both times for lack of evidence, but Valentine took the hint; from that point on nobody has complained&#x2014;how could they? But he has not stopped entertaining the children, certainly not. Leopards do not change their spots, and Valentine has not changed his. He just got wiser, darker, as wounded predators do. He has moved on into a more permanent game and he thinks he has found a way to play and never pay.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is wrong. <br> Tonight the bill comes due. <br> Valentine lives in a run-down apartment building just north of Opa-locka airport. The building looks at least fifty years old. Abandoned cars litter the street in front, some of them burned-out. The building shakes slightly when corporate jets fly low overhead, landing or taking off, and that sound interrupts the constant white noise of traffic on the nearby expressway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine&#x2019;s apartment is on the second floor, number eleven, and it has a very good view of a rotting playground with a rusting jungle gym, a tilting slide, and a basketball hoop with no net. Valentine has put a battered lawn chair on the balcony of his apartment, placed so he has a perfect view of the playground. He can sit and sip a beer and watch the children play and think his happy thoughts about playing with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he does. He has played with at least three young boys that we know about and probably more. In the last year and a half small bodies have been pulled from a nearby canal on three occasions. They had been sexually abused and then strangled. The boys were all from this neighborhood, which means that their parents are poor and probably in this country illegally. That means that even when their children were killed they had very little to say to the police&#x2014;and that makes their children perfect targets for Valentine. Three times, at least, and the police have no leads.<br> &nbsp;<br> But we do. We have more than a lead. We <i>know</i>. Steve Valentine watched those little boys at their games on the playground, and then he followed them away into the dusk and taught them his own very final games and then he put them into the murky trash-filled water of the canal. And he went satisfied back to his decrepit lawn chair, opened a beer, and watched the playground for a new little friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine thought he was very clever. He thought he had learned his lesson and found a better way to live out his dreams and make a home for his alternative lifestyle and there was nobody smart enough to catch him and make him stop. Until now he has been right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until tonight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Valentine had not been in his apartment when the cops came to investigate the three dead boys, and that was not luck. That was part of his predator&#x2019;s cleverness; he has a scanner for listening to police radio traffic. He knew when they were in the area. It would not be often. The police did not like to come to neighborhoods like this one, where the best they could hope for was hostile indifference. That is one reason Valentine lives here. But when the cops do come, he knows about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cops come if they have to, and they have to if Somebody calls 911 to report a couple fighting in apartment eleven on the second floor, and if Somebody says the fight ended suddenly with the sound of screaming terror followed by silence, they come quickly.<br> &nbsp;<br> And when Valentine hears them on his scanner, coming to his address, to his apartment, he will naturally want to be sure he is somewhere else before they get here. He will take any material he has that hints at his hobby&#x2014;and he will have some material, they always do&#x2014;and he will hurry downstairs and out into the darkness to his car, thinking that he can drive away until the radio tells him that things have calmed down again.<br> &nbsp;<br> He will not think that Someone would bother to look up his car&#x2019;s registration and know that he drives a light blue twelve-year-old Chevrolet Blazer with <i>Choose Life!</i> plates on it and a magnetic sign on the door that says, <i>Puffalump the Clown</i>. And he will not think that Something might be waiting for him in the backseat of this car, hunched down carefully into the shadows.<br> &nbsp;<br> He will be wrong about both of those things. Someone does know his car, and Something does wait silently hunkered down on the floor of the dark backseat of the old Chevy, waits while Valentine finishes wiping his face and smiling his secret smile of small triumph and finally&#x2014;<i>finally</i>&#x2014;puts the key in the ignition and starts the engine.<br> &nbsp;<br> And as the car sputters into life, the moment comes, suddenly, <i>finally</i>, and Something roars up and out of the darkness and snakes a blinding-fast loop of fifty-pound-test nylon fishing line around Valentine&#x2019;s doughy neck and pulls it tight before he can say anything more than, &#x201c;Guck&#x2014;!&#x201d; and he begins to flail his arms in a stupid, weak, pitiful way that makes Someone feel the cold contemptuous power running up the nylon line and deep into the hands holding it. And now the smile has melted from Valentine&#x2019;s face and flowed instead onto ours and we are there so close behind him that we can smell his fear and hear the terrified thumping of his heart and feel his lack of breath and this is <i>good</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You belong to us now,&#x201d; we tell him, and our Command Voice hits him like a jolt of the lightning that crackles outside now to punctuate the darkness. &#x201c;You will do just what we say and you will do it only when we say it.&#x201d; And Valentine thinks he has something to say about that and makes a small wet sound and so we pull the noose tight, very tight, just for a moment, so he will know that even his breath belongs to us. His face goes dark and his eyes bulge out and he raises his hands to his neck and his fingers scrabble madly at the noose for a few seconds until everything goes dark for him and his hands slide down into his lap and he slumps forward and begins to fade away and so we ease up on the noose because it is still too soon, much too soon for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> His shoulders move and he makes a sound like a rusty ratchet as he takes in one more breath, one more in the quickly dwindling number of breaths he has left to him, and because he does not yet know that the number is so very small he takes another quickly, a little easier, and he straightens up and wastes his precious air by croaking, &#x201c;What the fuck!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A string of nasty mucus drips from his nose and his voice sounds cramped and raspy and very irritating and so we pull once more on the noose, a little more gently this time, just enough so he will know that we own him now, and he very obediently gapes and clutches at his throat and then goes silent. &#x201c;No talking,&#x201d; we say. &#x201c;Drive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks up and into the rearview mirror and his eyes meet ours for the very first time&#x2014;only the eyes, showing cool and dark through the slits cut in the sleek silk hood that covers our face. For just a moment he thinks he will say something and we twitch the noose very gently, just enough to remind him, and he changes his mind. He looks away from the mirror, puts the car in gear, and drives.<br> &nbsp;<br> We steer him carefully south, encouraging him now and then with small tugs on the noose, just to keep that one thought in his mind that even breathing is not automatic and will not happen unless we say so, and he is very good for most of the trip. Only one time at a stoplight does he look back at us in the mirror and clear his throat and say, &#x201c;What are you&#x2014;where are we going?&#x201d; and we pull very hard on his leash for a long moment and let his world go dim.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are going where you are told to go,&#x201d; we say. &#x201c;Just drive, and do not talk, and you might live a little longer.&#x201d; And that is enough to make him behave, because he does not yet know that soon, so very soon, he will not <i>want</i> to live a little longer, because living as he will come to know it is a very painful thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> We steer him carefully along side streets and into an area of battered newer houses. Many of them are empty, foreclosed, and one of them in particular has been selected and prepared and we drive Valentine to this place, down a quiet street and under a broken streetlight and into an old-fashioned carport attached to this house and we make him park the car at the back of the carport, where it cannot be seen from the road, and turn off the engine.</p><h2>The Postman</h2><p>This is the story of a lie that became the most powerful kind of truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;A timeless novel as urgently compelling as <i>War Day</i> or <i>Alas, Babylon,</i> David Brin's <i>The Postman</i> is the dramatically moving saga of a man who rekindled the spirit of America through the power of a dream, from a modern master of science fiction.<br><br>He was a survivor--a wanderer who traded tales for food and shelter in the dark and savage aftermath of a devastating war.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate touches him one chill winter's day when he borrows the jacket of a long-dead postal worker to protect himself from the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old, worn uniform still has power as a symbol of hope, and with it he begins to weave his greatest tale, of a nation on the road to recovery.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Gordon Krantz survived the Doomwar only to spend years crossing a post-apocalypse United States looking for something or someone he could believe in again. Ironically, when he&#39;s inadvertently forced to assume the made-up role of a &#34;Restored United States&#34; postal inspector, he becomes the very thing he&#39;s been seeking: a symbol of hope and rebirth for a desperate nation. Gordon goes through the motions of establishing a new postal route in the Pacific Northwest, uniting secluded towns and enclaves that are starved for communication with the rest of the world. And even though inside he feels like a fraud, eventually he will have to stand up for the new society he&#39;s helping to build or see it destroyed by fanatic survivalists.

I shall be a willing and obedient---<br><br>Olivia---Lady Greenleigh now!---put down the boar-bristle brush that she had been absently drawing through her fair hair. There was that word again. Obedient. Drawing a deep breath, she placed both hands flat on her new mother-of-pearl-inlaid vanity and closed her eyes against her reflection in the fine gilded mirror.<br><br>The bedchamber in which Olivia waited shimmered with tasteful luxury, from the creamy silk brocade bed draperies, to the generously heaped coals in the hearth, to the very nightdress she wore, a floating confection of gauzy batiste that likely cost more than all her previous wardrobe combined.<br><br>The only thing it lacked was the presence of his lordship.<br><br>Men, Olivia decided, were rather like rain. If one needed it, it never seemed to come.<br><br>It is an honor to be chosen by such a gentleman. Her mother's voice echoed through her mind again and again. You have little to recommend you but your bloodline. If your brother had managed to marry that awful Hackerman Shipping heiress, things would be very different for us all. If Walter had lived . . .<br><br>If Walter had lived, Cheltenham would be saved, the family coffers would be full, her parents would be content, and Olivia would not be without her dear brother. She certainly would not have been constrained to accept the only offer of marriage that she had received.<br><br>Lord Greenleigh is a very handsome man. Lord Greenleigh is a very powerful man. Lord Greenleigh---<br><br>Lord Greenleigh was beginning to plague her off.<br><br>Enough. Olivia began to braid her hair for bed. She would get out of this silly, provocative nightdress as well. She may as well not have taken that second rosewater bath of the day, either. There was no point in waiting for the fellow---he obviously wasn't coming, just as he had not come to court her, just as he had not come to ask her if she wanted to marry him.<br><br>It wasn't as though she would have had the wherewithal to turn him down. She wasn't an idiot---she knew the family and all their dependents at Cheltenham had no other recourse but this marriage.<br><br>It simply would have been nice to have been asked.<br><br>Of course, Father had been no better, selling her off without the slightest thought to whether or not she even liked the man. No, Father had arranged the entire thing behind her back, like trading a recalcitrant horse.<br><br>Men were not like rain. Men were more like an outbreak of rodents. One never knew what they were doing out of sight. Just when one thought the cats were managing everything nicely, it turned out that the dratted things were plotting against one all the while.<br><br>Men were most definitely rats!<br><br>Feeling better having put that question to rest, Olivia removed her diaphanous wrapper---silly thing! It wouldn't serve a spider for its web!---and reached to untie the delicate tapes that held closed the neckline of her even more transparent nightgown.<br><br>A sound at the connecting door stopped her cold. Her indignation fled as she was forced to face anew the fears she'd been fighting for a month.<br><br>She was wife to a stranger. She was dependent on a man who could---well, who could do as he liked with her.<br><br>That could mean a great many things. She was not as sheltered as some of the young ladies she'd encountered during the last month of the Season. She'd not been governessed to bits, nor chaperoned by more than a lazy housemaid or two. As the years went by at Cheltenham, the servants had correctly assumed that Lord and Lady Cheltenham had no intentions of arranging a grand match for Lady Olivia.<br><br>Instead, her mother and father had pinned all their hopes on Walter, who was a year younger and a much better bet, being vastly more attractive and charming. Olivia could hardly blame them, for she'd been as dotty over Walt as any elder sister could be. He'd been full of life and humor yet not light-minded in the way of some spoiled young lords. She'd adored him, as had everyone who met him.<br><br>When Walt and her parents were gone from Cheltenham, which was much of the time, the entire estate seemed to go into a sort of hibernation. Most of the time, Olivia managed to occupy herself nicely with the cares and welfare of her family's dependents. The village of Cheltenham had suffered as much as the estate through the years of destitution, so Olivia did whatever she could to allay that suffering.<br><br>She was every bit as fond of her Cheltenham "family" as she was of her real one.<br><br>Which is why you wed Lord Greenleigh.<br><br>Right. Hopefully, pots of money would soon be on their way to Durham County in the north of England, earmarked for all the improvements that had been needed for so long.<br><br>Lord Greenleigh was a very generous man.<br><br>And he truly was a handsome giant. . . . <br><br>The fluttering in Olivia's middle was becoming a panicked beating of wings. She swallowed hard. I shall be a willing and obedient wife.<br><br>Unfortunately, obedience had never been one of Olivia's finest virtues. Not that she was intentionally rebellious or even especially contentious. She was more likely to be . . . accidentally disobedient.<br><br>Up until today, her mother's strictures had been the most difficult to obey: Your hair must never fall from its place. You must keep your feet hidden beneath your hem or they will think you no better than a milkmaid. You must not laugh loudly or long. Better yet, do not laugh at all. Smile, but show no teeth---you smile much too widely. Do try not to loom over the gentlemen, but do not slouch!<br><br>Her mother's rules did not matter now, she realized. Alas, Olivia was fairly sure that her bridegroom---husband!---had rules of his own, likely even more strict than Lady Cheltenham's. Rules . . . and demands.<br><br>Demands. Oh heavens. Never one to give in to fear, Olivia decided to give in to pique instead. The beast hadn't even bothered to court her!<br><br>"Not a visit, not a single note! Nothing but jewels!"<br><br>The gifts had been frequent and costly and aloof. Olivia would have preferred a bit of actual conversation.<br><br>She'd only seen her bridegroom twice before today. The first had been that disastrous day on---or, rather, under---the bridge. From that encounter she'd gathered that he was inclined to rescue others, that he was as large as a bridge pillar, that he was vain---although perhaps deservedly so---and that he liked to look at bosoms.<br><br>This could be said of any number of men in Society.<br><br>The second time she'd seen him had been the following day when he'd asked her father for her hand in marriage. If she hadn't happened to come in at just that moment from another interminable afternoon of calls with Mother and seen the two conspirators shaking hands in the entrance hall as if they'd just concluded a horse trade, she'd likely not have found out until the wedding day itself!<br><br>Lord Greenleigh hadn't even been embarrassed. He'd simply bowed briefly over her hand and said he was happy to have received her father's consent, then had sailed out the door while she'd stared after him, openmouthed.<br><br>From that encounter and the following two weeks of luxurious neglect she'd gathered that he was arrogant, managing, and thoughtless. Again, she could be describing any number of the gentlemen her mother had forced on her since she'd been brought to London and impressed into Society like a kidnapped sailor on a foreign ship.<br><br>Today she had been dressed and prepared for him like a veiled sacrifice. She had scarcely been able to see through the ornate lace and had spent most of the ceremony concentrating on not vomiting. At the wedding breakfast, the man at her side had been congenially indifferent, instead spending his attention on the man on his other hand, a fellow that Olivia vaguely recalled as being very nearly as handsome as Lord Greenleigh, in a darker, more pensive way.<br><br>From this she had learned that Lord Greenleigh was tidy in his manners, and that despite the fact that he smelled entirely wonderful, he was inclined to be very, very rude.<br><br>That was very little to go on. Yet here she was, wed to the man for the rest of her life. Her entire future rested in his hands alone. Of course, she had noticed during the meal, which she had scarcely been able to touch, that her new husband had large, shapely hands. In fact, despite his size, he possessed a leonine grace that made it difficult to take her gaze off him.<br><br>Now, however, her fascination was quickly dissolving into panicked exasperation. Could they not simply get it over with? Surely the dread was worse than the act itself! She wrapped both arms about herself despite the heat from the fire. She could not seem to get warm.<br><br>Olivia bent her head and paced before the hearth once more. She could add another thing to her list---Lord Greenleigh was rather inclined to be late!<br><br>Thankfully, Olivia felt her ire rise once more, drowning out her fear.<br><br>Men were rats.<br><br>Dane Calwell, Lord Greenleigh, had a problem. A very large problem. Even as he stood on the other side of his bride's door, he felt the problem growing. Damn, he hadn't even touched her yet!<br><br>There was nothing to be done about his problem. There was no one to discuss it with, for it was not the sort of thing one discussed with other men, and it was certainly not the sort of thing one discussed with a respectable woman---or even an unrespectable one, at that!<br><br>Dane had consulted a physician once---and only once. The man had laughed aloud and dismissed him with a clap on the back. "That's no problem, my lord---that's an asset!"<br><br>An asset? When even the most experienced courtesans drew back from him in alarm? When he was supposed to father an heir on an innocent, virtuous girl?<br><br>Some men would force her regardless. It was his right as her husband. The law was clear. Dane shuddered, appalled that he could even think it. There was much that he would do to protect the future of Greenleigh, but never that. If there was another heir, Dane would not even have attempted to wed, preferring to die forever celibate rather than beset a woman with his . . . problem.<br><br>Yet here he was, about to enter the bridal chamber, his problem growing unabated.<br><br>He had done his best to delay this moment, even to spending most of his wedding night working in his study. Then, when the clock had chimed eleven times, he had known he could not put it off any longer.<br><br>Across the desk from him, his best friend and prot�g�, Marcus Ramsay, Lord Dryden, caught his grimace and shook his head at Dane. "She's not unattractive, you know."<br><br>Dane shrugged carelessly, his expression carefully neutral. "She is precisely as I wished. A truly lovely woman would be far too distracting."<br><br>Marcus tilted his head. "So what is your difficulty? Why are you here working when you ought to be in the arms of your bride?"<br><br>Dane sighed and shoved himself out of his chair with both arms. "I'm off to her now. Are you satisfied?"<br><br>Marcus grinned, a flash of mischievous youth crossing his usually serious features. "I don't think I'm the one who is to be satisfied tonight."<br><br>Not likely, but he couldn't very well tell Marcus why. Dane frowned. "This is my lady wife we are discussing."<br><br>Marcus raised both hands against Dane's glare. "My apologies. Now, begone. I'll take these documents to the Prime Minister myself tonight. With Napoleon's spymaster still on the loose, I'd rather not trust these to a courier."<br><br>Dane nodded. The Chimera was not to be underestimated. The Royal Four had made that mistake already. For the better part of a year, the mysterious leader of the French espionage in London had avoided identification by the Liar's Club, the band of elite spies who acted at the command of the Royal Four. Only in the last weeks had it been discovered that the Chimera was a master of disguise who had walked among them as a petulant young servant they had all dismissed as harmless.<br><br>Denny---not his real name, surely, but all they knew to call him---had passed from Liar to Liar when his disagreeable attitude had made him impossible to keep around. Now Dane wondered if that had not been another part of the Chimera's plan. Passing through the households of several spies was bound to be more useful than remaining solely in the service of former spymaster Simon Raines, who had now retired.<br><br>The Chimera knew far too much about the Liar's Club---but how much did he know about the Royal Four? Only the Prime Minister and the Prince Regent himself knew the entire truth about the Four, and the current spymaster of the Liar's Club, Dalton Montmorency, Lord Etheridge, who had once been one of them.<br><br>Pondering the issue, Dane slowly climbed the stairs toward where his bride awaited him. If the Chimera learned the truth---if anyone on the other side knew of the power the Four wielded, power over the throne itself!---if the Four were exposed, the entire government of England would be ripped asunder. Especially when it was learned that it was the Royal Four who had declared King George mad and secreted him away, appointing Prince George IV as Regent of all Britain. The Cobra, the Lion, the Fox, and the Falcon had committed the highest treason, all in the deepest loyalty.<br><br>Although that particular decision had been made by Dane's predecessor and mentor, the previous Lion, as the current Lion, Dane upheld that decision with all his being. One man, king or no, could not be allowed to bring down England. Not even Dane himself, one of the four most powerful men in the land, could be permitted to put anyone or anything before his own duty.<br><br>Dane's own weak and traitorous father had taught him that lesson well. A woman had come between Henry Calwell and his duty, a beautiful Frenchwoman who had led Dane's father down a path of obsession and betrayal.<br><br>No breath of mistrust had ever reached Dane himself, but he knew perfectly well that if his father's betrayal had been known before Dane's appointment to the Lion's seat, Dane would never have been selected.<br><br>Blood will tell. No one so much as whispered the words, but Dane could feel the scrutiny of the other members of the Four like a breath on the back of his neck. He would always have to try harder---always be stricter in his observance of his vows---forever be prepared to sacrifice his own welfare for the sake of the Crown. Sometimes he almost envied what Nate Stonewell, the Cobra, had gone through when he'd been forced to take on the public role of traitor to hide a royal indiscretion. Dane had no such visible badge of honor to substantiate his loyalty. All he had was the shadow of his father's weakness.<br><br>Blood will tell.<br><br>Hence the selection of Lady Olivia for his bride. Not a woman to fall madly in love with. Not a woman to twist his thoughts and his soul into knots.<br><br>Not a woman to lead him to betrayal.<br><br>Now, Dane stood in his bedchamber and eyed the connecting doorway with disquiet. He had chosen Cheltenham's daughter with utmost care. Her mother had assured Dane that Olivia was the soul of discretion and virtue, that she was well schooled in all things ladylike, and he had seen for himself that she possessed a surprising fortitude for one so sheltered in life.<br><br>Fortitude she was going to need if she was to be his wife in truth. He'd not been able to bear the thought that some other man might snatch up such a prize, and with his usual decisiveness, he'd acted to secure her.<br><br>It occurred to him now, too late, of course, that perhaps he ought to have courted the girl a bit. It was going to be difficult enough to win her affections. He knew from experience that if he...</p><h2>Garfield Loses His Feet: His Ninth Book</h2><p>Can a cat with no feet....bounce into bed?...trot to the TV set?...race to the refrigerator?<br><br>You can be sure that your favorite furry feline will find a way!</p><p>Nine books and Garfield still makes me laugh!

All members of the royal family have been thus bound since the Alliance was made almost a thousand years ago; the binding system was created to strengthen the Alliance, because humans and pegasi can only communicate formally, through specially trained Speaker magicians. Sylvi is accustomed to seeing pegasi every day at the palace, but she still finds the idea of her binding very daunting. The official phrase is that your pegasus is your &#x201c;Excellent Friend.&#x201d; But how can you be friends with someone you can&#x2019;t talk to?<br><br> But everything is different for Sylvi and Ebon from the moment they meet at her binding&#x2014;when they discover they <i>can </i>talk to each other. They form so close a bond that it becomes a threat to the status quo&#x2014;and possibly to the future safety of their two nations. For some of the magicians believe there is a reason humans and pegasi should not fully understand each other...</p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>.

She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.<p></p>Gr 7 Up&#x2013;By the terms of an ancient treaty, children of royalty in Balsinland are &#x201c;bound&#x201d; to a pegasus on their 12th birthdays, in a ceremony cementing friendship between the two. However, humans and pegasi cannot speak to one another without the help of specially trained magicians because the two species communicate in such different ways. So, when Princess Sylviianel comes to her big day, she is nervous about being bound to one of these strange, beautiful, incomprehensible creatures...until, in the middle of the ceremony, she discovers that she can mind-speak to her pegasus&#x2013;and he can speak back. Such a thing has never been heard of in all the years of the alliance, but to Sylvi and her bond-friend it proves a wonderful gift by which they can promote better understanding between the two species. A few royal magicians, however, do not wish to see free communication develop between them, and they will do whatever they can to keep Sylvi and Ebon apart. This novel is reminiscent of McKinley's The Hero and the Crown (Greenwillow, 1984) and other earlier works, and includes many of her trademarks, including a tendency to ramble through pages of description and backstory, sometimes even in the middle of a conversation. Still, the story is strong and fresh, and the characters are nuanced and believable. Fans will anxiously await the sequel.&#x2013;Misti Tidman, formerly at Boyd County Public Library, Ashland, KY.

But in a cruel twist of fate, Evyn and his father suffer a brutal attack by a group of murderous ruffians. Evyn&#39;s tongue is cut off and his father is killed. Orphaned and unable to speak, Evyn assumes he is destined to a life of slavery. But Evyn is resilient and teaches himself to read and write. He is then appointed the personal companion to Earl Harold of Wessex, who later becomes the King of England. The two travel the countryside together, forming a close father-son bond. Evyn chronicles all of their exciting journeys, which culminate at the Battle of Hastings, where the future of the country is decided.Draw your chair to the fireside as the story of Evyn unfolds in Ron Keith&#39;s magnificent English accent. History is revealed through the story of Evyn, an adolescent Welsh serf whose dream of becoming a storyteller is dashed when his tongue is severed by his father&#39;s murderer. As Harold Godwinson ascends to the throne of England, the damaged Evyn comes to be his trusted friend, his foster son, his greatest champion. Each character speaks in a distinctly rendered and carefully accented voice. From the musical lilt of Evyn&#39;s words and subsequent thoughts to the lordly intonations of King Harold, Keith brings to life the gripping story of tragedy, war and death in the years from 1063 to 1066 for audiences aged 11 to 100.

The sophistication of Los Angeles and Hollywood seemed light-years from here. The city was just far enough so as to seem not to exist at all, and kids could still be kids on a warm summer day. School was drawing to a close before summer vacation, graduation was about to fall like a ripe plum into the seniors' hands, and the prom was only days away.<br><br>Johnny Peterson was the valedictorian of the senior class, and the star of both the track and the football teams for the past four years. He and Becky Adams had been going out for four years. They were standing on the school steps, talking to a group of friends, his tall lanky body swaying ever so slightly in her direction, as their eyes met from time to time. They shared the same barely guarded secret that many of the kids their age did. They were in love with each other, had been sleeping with each other for the past year, and had been seeing each other exclusively before that for all of their high school years. High school sweethearts, with vague but unspoken plans to wind up together one day. Johnny was about to turn eighteen in July, before starting college. Becky had turned eighteen in May.<br><br>His dark brown hair shone in the summer sunshine, with copper lights that seemed to be reflected in his dark brown eyes. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and athletic, had great teeth and a perfect smile. He looked the way every young man wished he could as a high school senior, but few do. But more than that, he was a terrific kid, and a nice guy. He had always been a good student, had lots of friends, and had two jobs when he wasn't playing sports and on weekends. His parents had very little money with three kids to support, and often just managed to get by. But they always did. He would have liked to play pro football and could have, but he had very sensibly decided to go to state college on a scholarship, and study accounting, so he could help his dad. His dad ran a small accounting firm, and had never much liked what he did. But Johnny didn't seem to mind it, and was a whiz in math. And his excellent computer skills were a huge help too. His mom had been a nurse and had retired years before, to take care of his younger brother and sister, which had turned out to be a full-time job, especially in the past five years. Charlotte, his little sister, had just turned fourteen and was starting high school in the fall. And Bobby, who was nine, was a special child.<br><br>Becky's family was not as orderly as Johnny's. She had four brothers and sisters, and their life had pretty much fallen apart two years before, when her dad died. He was a construction worker, and was killed in a freak accident. It left the family financially desperate and stunned. Becky had two jobs after school, and worked hard. They needed every penny she and her oldest brother could earn. And unlike Johnny, her scholarship hadn't come through. She was going to work full time at the drugstore all year, and try again for a scholarship next year. And she didn't really mind. She wasn't the student Johnny was, and she was relieved to have a break from school. She liked working, loved her two sisters and two brothers, and was happy to help her mom in whatever way she could. They had gotten pitifully little money from her dad's insurance, and things had been tough for a long time. Johnny was the sweet spot in her life.<br><br>Her hair was as fair as his was dark, her eyes as blue as the summer sky. She was a pretty girl, and she loved him.<br><br>She worried a little about his going to college and meeting other girls, but she knew he loved her. Everyone in their class said they were the perfect couple, they were always together, always laughing, talking, joking, happy, and they never seemed to fight. As much as they were boyfriend and girlfriend, they were also best friends. And because of that, Becky had fewer friends than she might have otherwise. She and Johnny spent every minute together they could. They went to class together, and saw each other at night, whenever possible, after sports, homework, and jobs. And they were both so conscientious, their parents no longer complained about how much they saw each other. They were rarely apart.<br><br>And as they stood at the center of a cluster of high school seniors, everyone was talking about graduation and prom. They had kept it a secret between them, but Johnny had paid for her dress. Without his help, she couldn't have gone. And she smiled up at him now, four years of love and confidences and secrets between them, and her eyes seemed to light up like fireworks when she looked at him.<br><br>"I've got to get going, you guys. I have to get to work," Johnny said, smiling at his friends. He worked at a nearby lumber company, taking inventory, sorting stock, and sawing wood. And he made good money for hard work. Becky was already working at the drugstore job that was about to become full time for her, and had just given up her second job waitressing in a coffee shop near school. It was going to be a lot easier for her now working in just one place. Johnny worked for his father on weekends, and the lumber supply company after practice and games. He was going to work for them full time all summer, to make as much money as he could before school. "Come on, Becky," he tugged at her arm, to pull her away from the girls who were still talking about what they were wearing to the prom that was two days away. For most of them, it was the end of an era, the culmination of a dream. And it was for Becky and Johnny too. But they had had none of the stress and panic of some of the others, wondering who to take as their dates. Their relationship gave them both confidence, and an unusual amount of emotional support. High school had been easier for them because of that.<br><br>Becky finally managed to tear herself away from their friends, and tossed her long blond hair over her shoulder as she followed Johnny to his car. He was carrying both their backpacks, and threw them easily into the backseat as he glanced at his watch. "Do you want to pick up the kids?" He tried to do that with her as often as he could. He was one of those people who enjoyed helping people out, and often did.<br><br>"Do you have time?" she asked comfortably. In some ways, they already seemed married, and in their heart of hearts they knew that they would be one day. It was another of the unspoken secrets they shared. They were so close, had grown up together, and sometimes it seemed like they didn't even need words.<br><br>"Sure, I've got time," he smiled at her, as she slid into her seat, and turned on the radio. They liked the same music, the same people, the same food. She loved watching him play football, he loved dancing with her, and talking to her for hours on the phone, after work. Most nights, he dropped by her house on his way home. And then he'd call her when he finished his homework. His mother said they were like Siamese twins.<br><br>The school where her younger siblings went was only four blocks away, and all four of them were hanging out in the schoolyard when they got there and Becky waved. The four Adams kids came thundering toward them, and as Becky leaned forward to let them in, they piled unceremoniously into the back of the car.<br><br>"Hi, Johnny," both boys said in unison, and Peter, the oldest one, at twelve, thanked him for the ride. They were nice, wholesome kids. Mark was eleven, Rachel was ten, and Sandi was seven. Theirs was a noisy, loving, lively house, and two years after he had died, they all still missed their dad. All their mom had done in the past two years was chase after them, and work too hard. She looked ten years older than she had when Mike had died. And although her friends kept telling her she should start dating, she just looked at them as though they were crazy, and told them she had no time. But it was more than that, and Becky knew it. Her mom had never loved anyone except her dad, and couldn't bear the thought of going out with another man. They had been high school sweethearts too.<br><br>Johnny dropped off Becky and the kids, she kissed him lightly before she got out, and he waved at all of them as he drove away. And as he disappeared down the street at full speed, she shepherded the others into the house, and helped them to get snacks and drinks, before leaving for work. She knew her mom would be home from her job in two hours. She ran the local beauty school. She was a pretty woman, life just hadn't turned out the way she'd dreamed. She had never expected to wind up alone at forty, with five kids.<br><br>Johnny was back at Becky's front door again four hours later, looking tired and happy. He stayed long enough to eat a sandwich with her at the kitchen table, chat with her mom, tease the kids, and head home by nine-thirty. His days were long and full.<br><br>"I can't believe it's almost graduation, seems like just last year you two were about five years old and going trick-or-treating together." Pam Adams shook her head and smiled as she watched Johnny unwind his long frame from the kitchen chair. He had played basketball in his freshman year, and been good at it, but eventually football and track had taken up all his time. Pam looked at Johnny gratefully, he was such a nice kid. She hoped he and Becky would get married one day, and that he would live a longer life than her husband had. But the years she'd shared with Mike had been so very good, she didn't regret an instant of them, just the fact that he was gone. "Thank you for getting Becky's dress for her," she said softly. She was the only one who knew. He hadn't even told his mom and dad.<br><br>"It looks great on her," Johnny said easily, slightly embarrassed by the look of gratitude in her mother's eyes. "We'll have a good time." He had ordered a corsage for her too.<br><br>"I hope so. Becky's dad and I got engaged at senior prom." She said it nostalgically, but it wasn't a hint to him. It was pretty obvious that they were heading that way too, with or without a ring.<br><br>"See you tomorrow," Johnny said as he left, and Becky followed him outside. They stood next to his car for a few minutes, chatting, and he took her in his arms and they kissed. It was a kiss filled with passion, emotion, all the feelings they shared, and the energy of youth, and she was breathless when they stopped.<br><br>"You'd better go before I drag you into the bushes, Johnny Peterson," she said with a giggle, and the smile that still tore his heart out after all these years.<br><br>"That sounds pretty good. Your mom might get a little upset," he teased. None of their parents knew, or so they thought, how far things had gone, although unbeknownst to them, both their mothers were well aware of it. Pam had had a talk with Becky once, and urged her to be careful. But they both were. They were both sensible kids and, so far at least, had had no slip-ups and no scares. Becky had no intention of getting pregnant before they got married, and that was still years away. Johnny had to finish school, and so did she, and she wasn't even starting for another year. They were in no hurry, they had all the time in the world. "I'll call you later," he promised, as he got into his car. He knew his mother would be waiting for him, most likely with something to eat, even though he'd eaten at Becky's house. And with no homework to do, he might spend some time with the kids and his dad. Depending on how things were when he got home.<br><br>He lived only two miles from Becky's house, and he was home five minutes later. He parked in the driveway behind his dad's car, and as he walked through the backyard he saw his younger sister Charlotte shooting baskets by herself, the way he used to do. She looked just like their mother, and a little like Becky, with big blue eyes and long blond hair. She was wearing shorts and a tank top, and her legs were nearly as long as his. She was tall for her age, and beautiful, but she didn't really care. The only thing that interested Charlotte was sports. She ate, slept, dreamed, and talked about nothing but baseball in the summer, football and basketball in the winter, and she played on every team she could. She was the most perfect all-around athlete, male or female, Johnny had ever known.<br><br>"Hi Charlie, how's it going?" he said, as he caught the ball she tossed at him. It always made him smile because she threw like a guy. She had a remarkable talent for sports.<br><br>"Okay," she glanced over her shoulder at him after he threw the ball back to her, and she sank another basket. And he could see, when she looked at him, that her eyes were sad.<br><br>"What's up?" He put an arm around her, and she stopped for a minute, and leaned against him. He could feel the sadness emanating through her. In the last few years, she seemed older than she was, in part because she was tall. But she was also wise beyond her years.<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>"Is Dad home?" But he knew he was, by the car. Johnny knew what was bothering her. It wasn't new to either of them, but it still hurt, after all these years.<br><br>"Yeah." She nodded, and then started to dribble the ball, as Johnny watched her for a minute, and then grabbed the ball from her. They played together for a few minutes, taking turns sinking baskets, and it struck him again how good she was. It was a shame in some ways that she wasn't a boy. And he knew she thought so too. She had gone to almost every game he'd played through all his high school years, and rooted passionately for him. Johnny was exactly who she wished she could be. He was her hero, more than anyone on earth.</p><h2>The Walk West: A Walk Across America 2</h2><p>Continues the Jenkins&#39; odyssey across America and celebration of its land and its people, as they wander through the bayous of Louisiana, across the Rockies, to the edge of the Pacific Ocean</p><p></p><h2>Jeremy Poldark: A Novel of Cornwall 1790-1791</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Winston Graham was the author of forty novels. His books have been widely translated and his famous series has been developed into two television series shown in 24 countries. Winston Graham was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1983 was awarded the OBE.<p>CHAPTER ONE </p><p>In August 1790 three men rode along the mule track past Grambler Mine and made towards the straggling cottages at the end of the village. It was evening and the sun had just set; clouds had been driven up the sky by a westerly breeze and were beginning to flush with the afterglow. Even the mine chimneys, from which no smoke had issued for best part of two years, took on a matured mellow colour in the evening light. In a hole in the taller of the two, pigeons were nesting, and their flapping wings beat against the wider silence as the men passed. A half dozen ragged children were playing with a homemade swing suspended between two of the sheds, and some women standing at the doors of cottages, hands on elbows, watched the horsemen ride by. </p><p>They were soberly dressed, respectable riders in a clerkish black, and they sat their horses with an air of importance; not many such were seen nowadays in this half-derelict, half-deserted village which had come into being and had existed solely to serve the mine and which, now that the mine was dead, was itself perishing of a slower decay. It seemed that the men were going to pass right through-as might have been expected-but at the last, one nodded his head and they reined in their horses at a more dejected-looking shack than anything they had yet seen. It was a one-story cob hut with an old iron pipe for a chimney and a roof patched and re-patched with sacking and driftwood; and at its open door on an upturned box sat a bowlegged man sharpening a piece of wood. He was under the average height, strongly built, but getting up in years. He wore old riding boots bound with string, yellow pigskin breeches, a dirty grey flannel shirt which had lost one sleeve at the elbow, and a stiff black leather waistcoat, whose pockets bulged with worthless odds and ends. He was whistling almost soundlessly, but when the men got down from their horses he unpursed his lips and looked at them with wary bloodshot eyes; his knife hung over the stick while he sized them up. </p><p>The leader, a tall emaciated man with eyes so close together as to suggest a cast, said: </p><p>"Good day. Is your name Paynter?" </p><p>The knife slowly lowered itself. The bowlegged man put up a dirty thumbnail and scratched the shiniest spot on his bald head. </p><p>"Mebbe." </p><p>The other made a gesture of impatience. "Come, man. You're either Paynter or you're not. It's not a subject on which there can be two opinions." </p><p>"Well, I aren't so sure 'bout that. Folk is too free with other folk's names. Mebbe there can be two opinions. Mebbe there can be three. It all depend what you d'want me for." </p><p>"It is Paynter," said one of the men behind. "Where's your wife, Paynter?" </p><p>"Gone Marasanvose. Now if you be wanting she..." </p><p>"My name is Tankard," said the first man sharply. "I'm an attorney acting for the Crown in the coming case of Rex versus Poldark. We want to ask you a few questions, Paynter. This is Blencowe, my clerk and Garth, an interested party. Will you lead the way inside?" </p><p>Jud Paynter's wrinkled teak-coloured face took on a look of injured inno�cence, but under this conventional defence there was a glint of genuine alarm. </p><p>"What are ee coming troubling me for? I said all I had to say afore magistrates, an' that were nothing. 'Ere I am, living a Christian life like St. Peter himself, sitting before his own front door interfering with no one. Leave me be." </p><p>"The law must take its course," said Tankard, and waited for Jud to get up.<br> After a minute, glancing suspiciously from one face to the other, Jud led the way inside. They seated themselves in the shadowy hut, Tankard staring distaste�fully about and lifting his coattails to avoid the litter as he sat down. None of the visitors had delicate noses, but Blencowe, a pasty, stooping little man, looked back wistfully at the sweet evening outside. </p><p>Jud said: "I don't know nothing about'n. You're barking up the wrong door." </p><p>"We have reason to believe," said Tankard, "that your deposition before the examining justice was false in every particular. If-" </p><p>"You'll pardon me," said Garth in an undertone. "Perhaps you'd be letting me speak to Paynter for a minute or two, Mr. Tankard. You remember I said, afore we came in, that there's more ways..." </p><p>Tankard folded his thin arms. "Oh, very well." </p><p>Jud turned his bulldog eyes upon his new adversary. He thought he had seen Garth before, riding through the village or some such. Snooping perhaps. </p><p>Garth said in a conversational, friendly tone: "I understand you were Captain Poldark's servant at one time, you and your wife, for a great many years and for his father afore him?" </p><p>"Mebbe." </p><p>"And after working faithful for him all those years you were suddenly put off, turned from the house without a word of warning." </p><p>"Ais. Tweren't right or proper, I'll say that." </p><p>"It is said, mind you, this is but hearsay, y'understand, that he treated you shameful afore you left-for some fancied misdeed-used his horsewhip and near drowned you under the pump. Would that be so?" </p><p>Jud spat on the floor and showed his two great teeth. </p><p>"That's against the law," interposed Tankard, squinting down his long thin nose. "Offences against the person: common assault and battery. You could have proceeded, Paynter." </p><p>"And it can't have been the first time, I'll wager," said Garth. </p><p>"No, nor it wasn't either," Jud said after a minute, sucking at his teeth. </p><p>"People who ill-treat faithful servants don't deserve them these days," said Garth. "There's a new spirit abroad. Every man is as good as his neighbour. Look what be happening in France." </p><p>"Ais, I d'know all about that," said Jud, and then stopped. It wouldn't do to let these prying busybodies into the secret of his visits to Rocco. All the time this Poldark stuff might be a blind to trap him into other admissions. </p><p>"Blencowe," said Tankard. "Have you the brandy? We could all do with a tot, and no doubt Paynter will join us." </p><p>...The afterglow faded, and the shadows in the littered hut grew darker. </p><p>"Take it from me," said Garth, "the aristocracy is finished. Their day is over. Common men will be coming into their rights. And one of their rights is not to be treated worse than dogs, not to be used as slaves. D'you understand the law, Mr. Paynter?" </p><p>"The Englishman's house is his castle," said Jud. "And habeas corpse, and thou shalt not move thy neighbour's landmark." </p><p>"When there's trouble at law," said Garth, "like what there was here in January, it's often hard for the law to act like it should. So it acts as best it may. And when there's riot and wrecking and robbery and suchlike, it says nothing about those who follow if so be as it can lay hold on those who lead is plain to be seen." </p><p>"Mebbe." </p><p>"No mebbe about it. But reliable evidence is hard to come by. Evidence of <br> responsible men like yourself...And, mind you, if the law sees it cannot prove a case against the ringleader, then it will look further and smoke out the lesser men. That's the truth of it, Mr. Paynter, as sure as I'm sitting here; so it's best for all that the right man should stand in the assizes." </p><p>Jud picked up his glass and set it down again, it being empty; Blencowe hastily proffered the brandy bottle. There was a comfortable bobbling sound as Jud upended it.</p></p><h2>Ethnic America: A History</h2><p>This classic work by the distinguished economist traces the history of nine American ethnic groups&#x2014;the Irish, Germans, Jews, Italians, Chinese, African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans.</p><p>THOMAS SOWELL has taught economics at Cornell, UCLA, Amherst, and other academic institutions, and his <i>Basic Economics</i> has been translated into six languages.

Democrats in Congress and Occupy&#x201d; protesters across the country assert that the free market is not only unforgiving, it&#x2019;s morally corrupt. According to President Obama and his allies, only by allowing the government to heavily control and regulate business and by redistributing the wealth can we ensure fairness and compassion.<br><br>Exactly the opposite is true, says Father Robert A. Sirico in his thought provoking new book, <i><b>Defending the Free Market: The Moral Case for a Free Economy</b></i>. Father Sirico argues that a free economy actually promotes charity, selflessness, and kindness. And in <i><b>Defending the Free Market</b></i>, he shows why free-market capitalism is not only the best way to ensure individual success and national prosperity but is also the surest route to a moral and socially just society.

Glenn Gray entered the army as a private in May 1941, having been drafted on the same day he was informed of his doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. He was discharged as a second lieutenant in October 1945, having been awarded a battlefield commission during fighting in France. Gray saw service in North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany in a counter-espionage unit. <p>Fourteen years after his discharge, Gray began to reread his war journals and letters in an attempt to find some meaning in his wartime experiences. The result is <i>The Warriors</i>, a philosophical meditation on what warfare does to us and an examination of the reasons soldiers act as they do. Gray explains the attractions of battle&#x2014;the adrenaline rush, the esprit de corps&#x2014;and analyzes the many rationalizations made by combat troops to justify their actions. In the end, Gray notes, &#x201c;War reveals dimensions of human nature both above and below the acceptable standards for humanity.&#x201d;</p></p><p>"[A] classic."&#x2014;Philip Caputo, <i>Washington Post</i> (Philip Caputo <i>Washington Post</i> 2010-05-09)</p><h2>Up Is Not the Only Way: Rethinking Career Mobility</h2><p><b>Up Was Never for Everyone!<br><br> </b>Move up or move out.

A story's use of time, plot, character, and other elements of fiction are analyzed, and readers are challenged to see each story's flaws and strengths. Careful endnotes bring attention to the ways in which various writers use language. Bell urges writers to develop the habit of thinking about form and finding the form that best suits their subject matter and style. His direct and practical advice allows writers to find their own voice and imagination.</p><p><strong>Madison Smartt Bell</strong> is the author of seventeen novels, his most recent being <em>Behind the Moon</em>.

Then one of her guests is poisoned and dies. Tricia's left to wonder if her cooking is to blame or if there's something much more sinister at play. Either way, Tricia's once again in hot water with her ex-lover, Chief Baker.<br><br>Meanwhile the charming town of Stoneham is being disrupted by a vandalism crime wave. It's the hot topic in the race for Chamber of Commerce president which sees Tricia pitted against two bitter rivals. With all that's going on can she find the killer before she's the next item on the menu?</p><p><b>Lorna Barrett </b>is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Booktown Mysteries, including <i>A Just Clause </i>and <i>Title Wave</i>.<p>One</p><p>Never had 221b Main Street, Stoneham, New Hampshire, seen so many people enter its doors. Instead of customers arriving for a book signing at Haven't Got a Clue, the village's vintage mystery bookstore, this gathering was of friends, sort-of relatives, and business associates from the local Chamber of Commerce. It was also Tricia's first stab at entertaining more than one or two people. Perhaps, she thought as another guest entered the newly refurbished living room of her loft apartment, she should have started with a more modest get-together. The space had more recently been a storeroom filled with shelves and boxes full of vintage mysteries. That stock now resided in the basement, which had also been renovated. The open-concept space was now bright, inviting, and&#x2014;more importantly&#x2014;felt like <i>home</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Isn't this a wonderful party?" Pixie Poe called, Tricia's newly married assistant. Pixie looked radiant in a vintage black, tight-fitting cocktail dress with a beaded bodice. Where she continually found those flirtatious frocks was a mystery to Tricia, but the style fit her to a T.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thanks for making the music mix CDs. They're perfect for a cocktail party."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"When it comes to entertainment, ya can't beat der Bingle, Frank, Dino, Tommy Dorsey, and the boys."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before Tricia could reply, Angelica swooped past with a brightly polished silver tray of stemmed wineglasses filled with Chardonnay. "We've run out of red," she called as she began worming her way through the crowd.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia's former assistant, and now step-niece and adopted little sister, Ginny Wilson-Barbero, had donned an apron that Angelica must have supplied and was passing around yet another silver tray with salmon cucumber rosettes. They looked adorable on the frilly paper doily-covered platter-just as Tricia had hoped they would.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she passed by the floor-to-ceiling antique mirror that stood against the east wall of her new digs, Tricia noted she looked pretty good, too&#x2014;considering she'd spent an hour or so crying her eyes out after returning from the cemetery. But now that the trial was behind her, she was determined not to think about it or Christopher's killer. When redecorating the apartment, she had allowed herself to display one framed photo of Christopher and her, taken on their honeymoon in Canc�n, but that was it. She'd even stopped wearing his engagement ring on a chain around her neck. She now thought of herself as free to move on with her life, and the party was one big step in that direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Contractor Jim Stark and his team had finished their work on the transformation more than a month before, but Tricia had wanted to settle in&#x2014;finding just the right places to set her treasures, some of which had been boxed up for years&#x2014;and, more importantly, to test the recipes she'd serve at her first (and possibly only) big bash. The ones she'd fed to her pseudofamily at their weekly Sunday dinners. Nobody had complained, and, in fact, the praise had been effusive, which had given her a much-needed boost of confidence in her burgeoning culinary skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia headed toward the dry bar she'd set up on a vintage glass-topped patio table. It had been a housewarming gift from Pixie and her groom, Fred Pillins, and it went perfectly with the eclectic furnishings she'd chosen. Although the table was laden with the best alcoholic spirits, Tricia decided she'd better keep a clear head. She plunked some ice into an old-fashioned glass, poured club soda from an opened bottle, and took a sip. <i>Eh</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Great party," Russ Smith said from behind Tricia, startling her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hi, Russ. So glad you could make it." Although he certainly hadn't dressed for such a party, wearing instead his usual attire of a plaid flannel shirt and rather grungy jeans. His only concession was a tired-looking corduroy sport coat with leather patches on the elbows that he'd probably worn since college. "Is Nikki here, too?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Russ tipped his glass, with what looked like Scotch in it, toward his wife, who was standing near one of the windows overlooking Main Street and conversing with Frannie Armstrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nikki looked fabulous in the proverbial little black dress, with her hair pulled back in a chignon, looking much more sophisticated than she did when behind the counter of the village's only bakery, the Patisserie, which she owned. However, the effect was spoiled, as she looked to be bored out of her mind. In contrast, Frannie, who managed Angelica's store, the Cookery&#x2014;a cookbook and sundries store&#x2014;looked like a tourist who'd lost her way en route to our fiftieth state. Tricia had only ever seen Frannie wear something other than a loud aloha shirt on rare occasions. Frannie, a sturdy woman in her mid-fifties, seemed to be snagging anyone who would listen so that she could introduce her latest gentleman friend, whom she'd met via an online dating service. She found a lot of guys that way, but none of them seemed to last long. Tricia had already forgotten the poor man's name. The tall gent, with a graying beard and sparse hair, didn't seem all that enthused to be attending the party, nor being shown off like Frannie's pet dog. Tricia felt sorry for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It sure feels good to be out and about&#x2014;and on a weeknight," Russ said, eyeing the Scotch bottle on the table. "That's just about unheard-of for us." He took a hearty slug of his drink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it tough finding a babysitter?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"More like tough getting Nikki to leave little Russell. She feels guilty for plunking him in day care most of the week. It's not like the kid is even up this late," he lamented. Not for the first time, Tricia got the impression that Russ wasn't exactly thrilled to be a daddy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Antonio Barbero&#x2014;whom Tricia referred to as Angelica's secret stepson&#x2014;passed by. It looked like he'd been enlisted to help pass out canap�s as well, and he offered the mini spinach quiches around, with just about everybody taking and enjoying one. Unlike Russ, Antonio loved being a dad to his daughter, little Sofia, born the very same day as Russ's son. And though Antonio sometimes worked hellish hours, he always found time for his precious bambina. Of course, Antonio was a good ten or twelve years younger than Russ, who Tricia suspected had never contemplated marriage, let alone fatherhood, when he'd worked out his life's plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>C'est la vie.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Angelica said you'd made all the food," Russ said, grabbing a quiche off the tray as Antonio passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia took a sip of her club soda. "Almost. A number of people brought goodies as well. Mary Fairchild brought some hot artichoke dip, and, of course, Nikki brought some of her marvelous mini cream puffs. A lot of people brought wine." She gestured toward the console table near the entryway, which was covered in bottles. Hmm, she ought to have mentioned that to Angelica when she'd stated they'd run out of red wine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Speaking of food, I'd better get back in the kitchen and make sure there's enough for everybody."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And I'll just pour myself another drink," Russ said, but he didn't sound all that pleased about the prospect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia made her escape and found Angelica leaning against the large white-and-black-veined granite island, presumably taking a breather. Or was it her four-inch stilettos that caused her discomfort&#x2014;not that she'd ever admit it? "Ange, why don't you go sit down in the living room and relax."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Me, relax at a party? Unthinkable," she said, and picked up a cookie-crumb-littered plate from the island.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, but it's <i>my </i>party&#x2014;not yours."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tricia, dear, you are the hostess&#x2014;that doesn't mean you have to play waitress. Now, I've got everything in the kitchen under control," she said, and held out a hand to show that she'd tidied the island, which had been where Tricia had spread out some of the food, including the chafing dish that was now nearly empty of her childhood favorite Swedish meatballs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes&#x2014;I also see you keep sending Ginny and Antonio out to play waitstaff."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And they are enjoying themselves."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you sure you didn't just browbeat them into helping out?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course not! Tricia, I don't think you realize it, dear, but there are a lot of people who would do anything to help you out because you're such a force for good in this town."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That wasn't true. It was Angelica who had earned that accolade in her role as founder of Nigela Ricita Associates, and anonymously, too. In a few short years she'd helped shape the village into what it was today&#x2014;a thriving success. She'd also accomplished that with her dual role as president of the Stoneham Chamber of Commerce. Tricia aspired to take her place, but she was sure she would never be able to fill her shoes. Eyeing the shiny red slingback Jimmy Choos, Tricia decided she'd much rather follow in Angelica's footsteps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Angelica turned for the refrigerator. "Now, what else can we surprise your guests with?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Most of the hors d'oeuvres are probably already gone&#x2014;"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You got that right. There's just one more tray of those crab-stuffed mushrooms. Wherever did you get that wonderful recipe?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"From your first cookbook&#x2014;as you darn well know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes," Angelica said with satisfaction, "simple, but elegant. And everybody loves them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At least those who like shellfish seemed to love them. Tricia wasn't a big fan herself, but they<i> did</i> look appetizing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Russ entered the kitchen. "Any chance there's another bottle of soda around?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Angelica handed Tricia the platter of rosettes and plucked the last bottle of club soda from the fridge's door. "Here you go."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thanks." He headed back toward the living room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Angelica looked after him. "He's had a few tonight."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes," Tricia said, and sighed. "I think he's grateful to be out of harness for a few hours. I just hope Nikki isn't going to have to drag him out of here kicking and screaming."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behind them, someone cleared his throat. They turned to find Mr. Everett, one of Tricia's employees and an honorary family member, standing near the kitchen island.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mr. Everett?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ms. Miles, I wanted to let you know that Grace"&#x2014;his wife of four years&#x2014;"and I are leaving."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So soon?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We've had a wonderful time, but we pick up our little bundle of joy bright and early tomorrow morning from the Animal Rescue League. We don't want to take the risk of being late."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia knew the equally elderly cat they were adopting had been waiting nearly two years to find his forever home. "I understand completely."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where are you parked?" Angelica asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"In the municipal lot."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let me get Antonio to walk you to your car."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, no. That won't be necessary. We don't want to bother anyone."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's no bother," Angelica assured him, and charged toward the living room to flag down Antonio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Will you be bringing pictures of Charlie into work tomorrow?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I wanted to speak to you about that," Mr. Everett said, sounding contrite. "I was wondering if I might have the entire morning off. I would like to make sure Charlie is well acclimated before I leave him. Grace thinks I'm being foolish, but I haven't owned a pet in a long time." He had, however, taken care of Tricia's cat, Miss Marple, for about a week the summer before. "I don't wish to neglect my pet on his first day with us."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course not. Take all the time you need. Pixie and I will handle everything."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're very generous, Ms. Miles."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nonsense. I want your new family member to feel secure. I'm just so happy for the two of you. You're doing a wonderful thing adopting Charlie."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a difficult decision to make. At our ages . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was why they were adopting an elderly cat&#x2014;the fear of outliving a younger pet. And also the fact that taking Charlie in would give the feline the opportunity to live out the remainder of his life in a loving home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Angelica and Antonio arrived, along with Grace's and Mr. Everett's coats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Dear boy, you do not need to walk us to our car," Grace exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It would be my pleasure. I want to hear all about your new bambino, too," Antonio said. Tricia just loved to hear his lilting Italian accent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm afraid we may bore all our friends. William has even learned to take pictures with his phone just to chronicle our boy's arrival."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Everett ducked his head, blushing in embarrassment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I can't wait to see them," Tricia said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Me, too," Angelica chimed in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Everett slipped on his coat and buttoned it, and then he, Grace, and Antonio headed for the door, calling good-bye over their shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, dear," Tricia said. "Do you think them leaving will cause the party to break up early?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"As we're running out of food and some drink, that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world," Angelica said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tricia nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Now I'll hustle that last tray of canap�s out to the hungry crowd, while you check on your guests."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Right." Tricia walked away from the island, heading for a group standing near the door.

Now that the renovations on her home were complete, and since the campaign season was to start in three days, Tricia <i>had </i>decided to pursue the job. Oh, dear.

Deftly interweaving the story of King&#x2019;s quest with a history of the African American struggle for equality, Frady offers fascinating insights into his subject&#x2019;s magnetic character, with its mixture of piety and ambition. He explores the complexities of King&#x2019;s relationships with other civil rights leaders, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and the FBI&#x2019;s J. Edgar Hoover, who conducted a relentless vendetta against him. The result is a biography that conveys not just the facts of King&#x2019;s life but the power of his legacy.</p><p>Unheroic in appearance, given to "deacon-sober suits" and "ponderous gravity," Martin Luther King Jr. ushered in an epochal era of change in the United States. Closely watching King's journey from Montgomery to Birmingham to the Lincoln Memorial to Memphis was journalist Marshall Frady, who honors the minister's achievement and spirit in this lucid biography.<p> "Almost a geological age ago, it seems now--that great moral saga of belief and violence that unfolded in the musky deeps of the South during the civil rights movement of the fifties and sixties." So Frady opens his account, which traces King's transformation from withdrawn, unconfident child to eloquent champion of the oppressed, ever unafraid to trouble the waters. Frady explores King's conflicts, contradictions, and triumphs, as well as the great personal cost he bore in urging nonviolent change in a singularly violent time.</p><p> Part of the excellent Penguin Lives series, this slender volume sheds much light on a prophet now honored, but still too little understood. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Marshall Frady (1940&#x2013;2004) was a veteran journalist who wrote for <b>Newsweek</b>, <b>Harper&#x2019;s</b>, and <b>The</b> <b>New Yorker</b>.

Like anywhere else, people don't get into the army or into prison unless the authorities want them there. Unlike other places, once you are in, you live the life of a slave. Armies everywhere try to keep what they do quiet, and perhaps this is why we talk about generals as if they belonged to an international tribe whose personality is the same all over the world, irrespective of which president or state they serve.There are, however, further peculiarities specific to the Russian army or, rather, to relations between the army and the civilian population. The civilian authorities have no control over what happens in the military. A private, who belongs to the lowest caste in the hierarchy, is a nobody, a nothing. Behind the concrete walls of the barracks, officers can mistreat soldiers with impunity. Similarly, a senior officer can do anything he fancies, anything at all, to a junior colleague.You are probably thinking that things surely cannot be so bad.Well, not always; sometimes things are better, but only becausesome humane individual has called his subordinates to order. Those are the only rays of hope."But what about Russia's leaders?" you may wonder. "The president is the commander in chief, personally responsible for what goes on, isn't he?"Unfortunately, once they make it to the Kremlin, our leaders abandon any attempt to rein in the army's lawlessness and are more likely to give senior officers ever greater power. The army either supports or undermines the leaders depending on whether they indulge it. The one attempt to humanize the army was made under Boris Yeltsin as part of an effort to promote democratic freedom. The program didn't last long. In Russia, holding on to power is more important than saving soldiers' lives, and under a barrage of fury from the generals, Yeltsin ran up the white flag and surrendered.Putin hasn't even tried. He himself is a former officer. End of story. When he first emerged as a possible head of state rather than an unpopular director of the universally detested Federal Security Bureau (FSB), he started making pronouncements to the effect that the army, diminished under Yeltsin and by its defeat in the first Chechen war, would be rejuvenated, and that all it lacked for its rebirth was a second Chechen war. This assertion is responsible for everything that has followed. When the second Chechen war began, in 1999, the army was given free rein, and in the presidential elections of 2000, it voted as one for Putin. For the army, the present war has been highly profitable, a source of medals and accelerated promotions, and a first-rate springboard for a political career. Generals who leave active service are catapulted directly into the political elite.How exactly Putin helped the army we shall see in the stories that follow. You decide whether you would like to live in a country where your taxes maintain such an institution. How would you feel if when your son turned eighteen, he was conscripted as "human materiel"? How secure would you feel with an army where every week the soldiers desert in droves, sometimes whole squads at a time, even entire companies. What would you think of an army in which, in a singleyear, 2002, a complete battalion, more than five hundred men, had been killed not by enemy fire but by beatings, and in which the officers steal everything, from the ten-rouble notes privates receive from their parents to a full tank column? In which all the officers hate the soldiers' parents because every so often, when the circumstances are just too disgraceful, an outraged mother protests her son's murder and demands retribution?No. U-729343: FORGOTTEN ON THE BATTLEFIELDIt is November 18, 2002. Nina Levurda is a heavy, slow-moving woman, a retired schoolteacher, old and tired and with a string of serious ailments. Like many other times over the past year, she has been sitting for hours in the unwelcoming waiting room of the Krasnaya Presnya District Court, in Moscow.Nina has nowhere else to turn. She is a mother without a son: even worse, without the truth about her son. Lieutenant Pavel Levurda, born in 1975, soldier No. U-729343, was killed at the start of the second Chechen war. What has compelled Nina to spend the past eleven months doing the rounds of legal institutions is not that No. U-729343 was killed but the events surrounding his death and what followed it. Her one aim: to get a precise answer from the state as to why her son was left behind on the battlefield. She would also like to know why, since his death, she has been treated so abominably by the Ministry of Defense.As a child, Pavel Levurda dreamed of a career in the army--not too common nowadays. Boys from poor families do apply for places at the military academies, but their aim is to earn a degree and then be discharged. The self-congratulatory reports from the president's office about the increasing competition for admission to military institutes are true. But the situation has less to do with a rise in the army's prestige than with the abject poverty of those seeking an education. A desire for training but an unwillingness to serve in the army also explainsthe catastrophic shortage of junior officers in the field. When they graduate from military college, they simply fail to appear at the garrisons to which they have been posted. They suddenly become "seriously ill" and send in certificates testifying to all manner of unexpected disabilities. This is not difficult to arrange in a country as corrupt as Russia.Pavel was different. He really wanted to be an officer. His parents tried to dissuade him, because they knew how hard life is in the army. Petr Levurda, his father, was himself an officer, and the family had constantly been shifted from one remote garrison to another.In the early 1990s, moreover, the collapse of the Soviet empire had left chaos in its wake. A high school graduate would have been mad, everyone agreed, to choose to attend a military academy that couldn't feed its students. But Pavel insisted on his dream and went to study at the Far East College for Officers. In 1996 he received a commission and was sent to serve near Saint Petersburg. Then, in 1998, he was thrown into the frying pan: the Fifty-eighth Army.In Russia, the Fifty-eighth Army is synonymous with the army's degeneration. Its bad reputation, of course, began before Putin. He does, however, bear a heavy responsibility--because the anarchy among its officers goes unchecked; they are effectively above the law. With very few exceptions, they are not prosecuted, no matter what crimes they commit.In addition, the Fifty-eighth was in the hands of General Vladimir Shamanov. A Russian hero who fought in both Chechen wars, he was known for his brutality toward the civilian population. When Shamanov resigned, he became governor of Ulyanovsk Province, benefiting from his role in the second Chechen war, during which he was rarely off the television screen. Daily he would inform the country that "all Chechens are bandits" who deserved to be eliminated. In this enterprise he enjoyed Putin's full support.The staff headquarters of the Fifty-eighth Army is in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the republic of North Ossetia--Alaniya, which borders Chechnya and Ingushetia. The officers of the Fifty-eighth Army, followingtheir general's example, were renowned for their cruelty toward both the people of Chechnya and their own soldiers and junior officers. Rostov-on-Don is the location of the general headquarters of the North Caucasus Military District, to which the Fifty-eighth Army is subordinate. The greater part of the archive of the Rostov Committee of Soldiers' Mothers consists of files relating to desertion by privates as the result of beatings by their officers, who are also well known for the blatant theft of supplies and for wholesale treason: by selling stolen weapons to the Chechen resistance, the officers aid the enemy.I know many junior officers who have gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid serving in the Fifty-eighth. Levurda, however, decided otherwise. His letters make heavy reading; when he came home on leave, his parents saw their son becoming more and more morose. Whenever they urged him to resign, however, he would say, "What must be done must be done." Clearly Pavel Levurda was someone who could justly be described as a profoundly patriotic young Russian with a special sense of duty toward the motherland. In fact, he was hoping for a genuine, rather than Putinesque, rebirth of the Russian army.In 2000, when the second Chechen war began, Pavel Levurda had an opportunity to avoid fighting in the northern Caucasus. Few would have blamed him. Many junior officers found ways to obtain exemptions. But, as Pavel explained to his parents, he couldn't desert his soldiers: when they were sent to Chechnya, he went as well. On January 13, 2000, Pavel reported to the Fifteenth Guards Motorized Infantry Regiment of the Second (Taman) Guards Division (Army Unit 73881), in Moscow Province. On January 14, Nina heard her son's voice on the telephone for the last time. He had signed a special contract to go to Chechnya, and it was clear enough what that portended."I cried. I did my best to change his mind," Nina remembers. "But Pavel said there was no going back. I asked my cousin who lives in Moscow to go straight to the Taman Division, to try to talk him out of it. When she got to the unit, she found she had missed him by just a few hours."By January 18, No. U-729343 was in Chechnya. "At present I am on the southwest outskirts of Grozny ... ," Pavel wrote in his only letter to his parents from the war, dated January 24.The city is blockaded from all directions and serious fighting is going on. The gunfire doesn't stop for a minute. The city is burning, the sky is completely b...</p><h2>Pacific Seaweeds: Updated and Expanded Edition</h2><p><p>This updated and expanded guide thoroughly documents every aspect of seaweed life, from species identification and seaweed biology to the essential--and often surprising--roles seaweed plays in the marine ecosystem and our everyday lives.

It said THE AMAZING POWERS OF THE INTELLECT in bold letters at the top, and this attracted his attention. He hoped that there were amazing powers in the intellect, although his dealings with others and many years of self-examination had revealed none that he thought much of. In smaller letters at the bottom, the poster said 14 AUGUST, FOUR P.M. and LYNCHGATE HOUSE, BATH.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had a little trouble finding it, because in England &#x201c;Lynchgate House&#x201d; could mean anything from a private cottage to the corporate headquarters of a conglomerate. By asking directions he discovered it to be a country house not, strictly speaking, in Bath, owned by someone not named Lynchgate. When he arrived, he found a pair of pink, beefy young women at the entrance to smile at everyone and presumably to shut the door when their number approximated the capacity of Lynchgate House. Inside, he followed a middle-aged woman in a flowered dress to a large room with leaded-glass windows that reached from the fifteen-foot ceiling nearly to the floor, and looked out onto a garden with a foreground of topiary trees shaved and worried into the shape of gumdrops and a background of hedges nearly twenty feet high.<br> &nbsp;<br> The room contained about thirty-five people, all very British and all apparently from the class of British people who always seemed to be busy doing things that couldn&#x2019;t possibly bring in any money, but didn&#x2019;t necessarily cost much, either: gardening and bird hikes and lectures. He wondered how many of them knew Latin, and decided that probably all of them did. His eyes settled inevitably on a pretty young woman who was arranging some pamphlets on a table at the front. She bent over as she worked, and he appreciated the curve of her hips under the light silk dress she wore. At this moment The Honourable Meg came in, scanned the crowd and sat down next to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first thing Schaeffer noticed was her skin. It was fair, and appeared to have an even, uniform smoothness like natural ivory, its only variance a slight flush to her cheeks. Her shining dark brown hair made the skin seem to glow, and her bright green eyes looked amused. What she had wasn&#x2019;t exactly beauty, but perfection, and this was unnerving because it tempted him to scrutinize her for flaws. He sat stiffly in his chair to keep from violating the expanded amount of space that seemed her due.<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl he had been watching turned around and announced, &#x201c;Mrs. Purvis will open the meeting with a few announcements on our autumn trip to Atlantis.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Schaeffer barely breathed. Maybe it was the name of something else, or maybe he had heard the word wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Purvis was a slightly plump, enthusiastic blond lady in her forties, and she dispelled his doubts. &#x201c;After the experience we had last year on our trip to the alien landing strips on the Plains of Nazca, I&#x2019;d like to beg everyone to pay attention to the instruction sheet when packing this year. We&#x2019;ll be establishing our base camp on Grand Turk Island. It is tropical, but we&#x2019;ll be there in hurricane season. During a hurricane, between twenty-five and fifty centimeters of rain may fall in two days, and the winds may be violent, so dress accordingly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael Schaeffer felt distinctly uncomfortable. He wondered for a moment how this group of people would go about dressing for twenty inches of rain and 150-mile-an-hour winds. The girl who had introduced Mrs. Purvis now launched into a few more details. &#x201c;Everything we know about ancient Atlantis suggests they wore bright colors, probably lots of reds and yellows. So please try to respect that scheme. There will be ever-so-many lingering spirits about, and it won&#x2019;t do to offend them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Schaeffer slipped out of his seat and moved toward the door. As he made it past the two beefy girls, one of them asked, &#x201c;Something wrong, Meg?&#x201d; and he heard a soft voice at his shoulder. &#x201c;Sorry, dear. We&#x2019;ve just got to leave. My friend has another appointment.&#x201d; Then she slipped her arm in Michael&#x2019;s and pulled him out of Lynchgate House.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside the door she didn&#x2019;t let go of his arm. &#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;m sorry I had to hitchhike, but when you left it was my last chance. Two persons might have to leave at once for some perfectly benign reason, but if they leave one after the other, it appears to be a trend and they get very upset.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do they?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d; He tried to turn toward her to remove his arm from her grasp subtly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll think I just grabbed you for a convenient exit, and they already resent me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who are you, their psychiatrist?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Meg Holroyd. The Honourable Margaret Susanna Moncrief Holroyd. Does that mean anything to you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where I come from, it would mean you&#x2019;re a politician, so the &#x2018;Honourable&#x2019; would be a lie. Here I suppose it means something else.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s a lie here, too. It means that hundreds of years ago there was a man in my family whose homicidal tendencies got him a title. My people are from York, but nobody goes up north anymore except to sweep the cobwebs out of the family battlements. Where do you come from, by the way?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Arizona.&#x201d; Automatically he fed her the first half of his prepared story.<br> &nbsp;<br> She demanded the other half. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Michael. Would you like to go for tea or something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Charmingly put. Who could refuse? Macready&#x2019;s isn&#x2019;t far.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good. When we get there you&#x2019;ll have to let go of my arm. Why do those people resent you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She smiled proudly. &#x201c;I did something cruel to them for fun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You did?&#x201d; He watched her as they walked. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something horrible. Afterward, at the next meeting, they voted a formal reprimand and made speeches saying how irresponsible I was about taking care of the hidden secrets vouchsafed to the initiates.&#x201d; She laughed happily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In other words, you&#x2019;re not planning to tell me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She studied him for a moment, or pretended to. &#x201c;Yes, knowing you as I do, I suppose I&#x2019;ll have to. You&#x2019;ll make me, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As they entered Macready&#x2019;s tea shop and he followed her to a table in a dark corner, he had a moment to evaluate the risk he was taking. But then they were seated, and he decided to defend himself with questions. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to take your friends very seriously. What are you doing with them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re one of my hobbies. I give them money, so I get to play with them. I inherited them, actually. My grandfather was a scholarly sort, and all his life he supported study groups and lectures on scientific topics. But late in life when he was beginning to think a lot about dying, and was getting a bit dotty, he lost interest in geology and archaeology and flora and fauna, and became obsessed with this sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Expeditions to Atlantis?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s a whole range of things, all mixed up and linked together. There&#x2019;s Atlantis, but some of them think it was an ancient civilization and others think it was people from outer space. There&#x2019;s a smaller faction who think it was an ancient civilization destroyed by people from outer space, and another that think it wasn&#x2019;t destroyed at all, that they&#x2019;re still underwater, waiting for us to be worthy of their company before they&#x2019;ll come out. I hope they&#x2019;re not holding their breath. It&#x2019;s pretty easy to get an expedition together: if you&#x2019;re a lunatic you have to hold some theory that accounts for Atlantis.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because lunatics are systematic thinkers. If they have a secret history of the world to put forward, they can&#x2019;t have other lunatics shouting, &#x2018;Then, how do you account for the pyramids? What about Stonehenge? Easter Island?&#x2019; They have to include these things.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did you do to them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ashamed to tell you.&#x201d; She stared into her teacup, then added, &#x201c;But of course I will. I assaulted them. Sexually.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Schaeffer looked at her. &#x201c;All of them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Every last one. All of the people who were there today, and a few more who were otherwise engaged. Attendance is down today; you were the only new one. A month ago, I came in and took the podium. I&#x2019;d been in Paris for some time, but I&#x2019;d told everyone I was going to Bolivia. I was supposed to tell them about my research at Tiahuanaco. I went on for some time with slides of the ruins, the weeping god and all that, and then told them about my greatest discovery: I&#x2019;d found a true aphrodisiac. I told them that in a tiny village I&#x2019;d found a curaca, and paid him eight hundred pounds for a small vial of the stuff.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you sold it to them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, no. It wasn&#x2019;t anything so crass as wanting their money. I just wanted to play with them. I told them I&#x2019;d put it in their punch at the reception before the meeting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And had you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course not. There&#x2019;s no such thing. I&#x2019;d slipped in a little powdered Valium mixed with cognac so they&#x2019;d feel something. I said I&#x2019;d just put some in so they could help with the experiment. But I&#x2019;d prepared rather well. I&#x2019;d hired two very attractive and respectable-looking prostitutes in London on the way home, and had them come to the meeting separately as interested beginners. Around this time they began to show symptoms that something was very wrong, if you know what I mean.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Lonely Planet Norway (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i></p> <p><b><i>Lonely Planet Norway</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.<br><br>There are worse threats in the woods than the things that stalk their prey at night. Sometimes, there are men. Men with dark desires, weak wills, and evil intents. Men in uniform with classified information, deadly secrets, and unforgiving orders. And sometimes, just sometimes, there's something worse than all of the horrible people and vicious beasts combined. <br><br>Red doesn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she isn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she is a woman alone in the woods....</p><p><b>Christina Henry</b> is the author of <i>Alice</i>, <i>Red Queen</i>, <i>Lost Boy, The Mermaid</i>, and the national bestselling Black Wings series, featuring Agent of Death Madeline Black and her popcorn-loving gargoyle, Beezle.CHAPTER 1<br><br>The Taste of Fears<br><br>Somewhere in an American forest<br><br>The fellow across the fire gave Red the once-over, from the wild corkscrews of her hair peeking out from under her red hood to the small hand axe that rested on the ground beside her. His eyes darted from the dried blood on the blade-just a shadow in the firelight-to the backpack of supplies next to it and back to her face, which she made as bland as rice pudding.<br><br>Red knew very well what he was thinking, what he thought he would be able to do to her. Men like him were everywhere, before and after the world fell apart, and it didn't take any great perception to see what was in their eyes. No doubt he'd raped and murdered and thieved plenty since the Crisis (she always thought of it that way, with a capital letter) began. He'd hurt those he thought were weak or that he took by surprise, and he'd survived because of it.<br><br>Lots of people thought that because she was a woman with a prosthetic leg it would be easy to take advantage of her-that she would be slow, or incapable. Lots of people found out they were wrong. Someone had found out just a short while before-hence the still-bloody axe that kept drawing the attention of the stranger who'd come to her fire without invitation.<br><br>She should have cleaned the blade, though not because she was worried about scaring him. She should have done it because it was her only defense besides her brain, and she ought to take better care of it.<br><br>He'd swaggered out of the trees and into the clearing, all "hey-little-lady-don't-you-want-some-company." He had remarked on the cold night and how nice her fire looked. His hair was bristle-brush stiff and close to the scalp, like he'd shaved it to the skin once, but it was growing out now. Had he shaved it because he'd been a soldier? If he had been, he was likely a deserter now. He was skinny in a ropy muscled way, and put her in mind of a coyote. A hungry coyote.<br><br>He didn't look sick; that was the main thing. Of course nobody looked sick when they first caught it, but pretty soon after they would be coughing and their eyes would be red from all the burst blood vessels and a few days after the Cough started, well . . . it was deceptively mild at first, that cough, just a dry throat that didn't seem to go away and then it suddenly was much more, a mild skirmish that turned into a world war without your noticing.<br><br>It didn't escape Red's notice that underneath his raggedy field coat there was a bulge at his hip. She wondered, in a vaguely interested sort of way, if he actually knew how to use the gun or if he just enjoyed pretending he was a man while flashing it around.<br><br>She waited. She wasn't under any obligation to be polite to someone who thought she was his next victim. He hadn't introduced himself, although he had put his hands near the fire she'd so painstakingly built.<br><br>"Are you . . . ?" he began, his eyes darting over her again. His gaze paused for a moment when he saw the gleam of metal at her left ankle, visible just beneath the roll of her pants.<br><br>"Am I what?" she asked. Her tone did not encourage further conversation.<br><br>He hesitated, seemingly thinking better of it, then gestured at his face. "Your eyes are light, but your skin is brown. You look like you're half-and-half."<br><br>She gave him her blandest glance yet, her face no more expressive than a slice of Wonder Bread.<br><br>"Half-and-half?" she said, pretending not to understand.<br><br>Red had that indeterminate mixed-race look that made white people nervous, because they didn't know what box to put her in. She might be half African or Middle Eastern. She might be a Latina or maybe she was just a really dark Italian. Her eyes were an inheritance from her father, a kind of greenish blue, and that always caused further confusion.<br><br>Their eyes always flicked up to her hair, looking for clues, but she had big fat curls that could have come from anybody. She was used to speculative glances and stupid questions, having dealt with a lifetime of them, but it always surprised her (it shouldn't have, but it did) how many people still cared about that dumb shit when the world was coming to an end.<br><br>"I was just wondering what-" he said.<br><br>"Where I come from it's not polite to start asking people about their folk before you're even introduced."<br><br>"Right," he said. The intruder had lost some of the swagger he'd had coming into the clearing in the first place.<br><br>"What are you doing out here on your own? I thought everyone was supposed to go to the nearest quarantine camp," he finally said, choosing not to introduce himself despite her admonishment.<br><br>They were not going to be friends, then. Red did not feel sad about this.<br><br>"What are you doing out here on your own?" she answered.<br><br>"Right," he said, shuffling his feet. His eyes darted in all directions, a sure sign that a lie was on offer. "I lost my friends in the dark. There were soldiers and we got separated."<br><br>"Soldiers?" she asked, sharper than she intended. "A foot patrol?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"How many soldiers?"<br><br>He shrugged. "I dunno. A bunch. It was dark, and we didn't want to go to the camp. Same as you."<br><br>Don't try to act like we have something in common. "Did you come from the highway? Do you know which way they were headed? Did they follow you?"<br>"No, I got away clean. Didn't hear any of them behind me."<br>This sounded like something he'd made up to explain the fact that he was alone in the woods with no supplies and no companions and sniffing around her fire looking for something he didn't have.<br>Red sincerely hoped he was as full of shit as he seemed, because she was not interested in encountering any soldiers. The government wanted everyone rounded up and quarantined ("to safely prevent the further spread of the disease"-Red had snorted when she heard that announcement because the fastest way to spread disease is to put a whole bunch of people in tight quarters and those government doctors ought to know better) and she didn't have time for their quarantine. She had to get to her grandmother, and she still had a very long way to go.<br>Red had passed near a highway earlier in the day. The experience filled her with anxiety since soldiers (and people generally) were more likely to be near highways and roadways and towns. She hadn't encountered a patrol there, but she'd had a small . . . conflict . . . with a group of three ordinary people about two or three miles into the woods past the road. Since then she'd tried to make tracks as fast as possible away from anywhere that might be populated. Red wasn't interested in joining up with a group.<br>She hadn't asked the coyote to sit down and join her, and it was clear he didn't know what to do with himself. Red could see the shape of what he figured would happen on his face.<br>He'd thought she would be polite, that she would offer to share her space with him. He'd thought she would trust him, because she was alone and he was alone and of course people were pack animals and would naturally want to herd together. Then when her guard was down or maybe when she'd fallen asleep, he'd take what he wanted from her and leave. She was not following his script, and he didn't know how to improvise.<br>Well, Red's mother hadn't raised a fool, and she wasn't about to invite a coyote to sit down to dinner with her. She stirred the stew over the fire and determined that it was finished heating.<br>"That smells good," he said hopefully.<br>"Sure does," Red replied. She pulled the pot off the fire and poured some of the stew into her camp bowl.<br>"I haven't eaten a darn thing since yesterday," he said.<br>Red moved the bowl into her lap and spooned a tiny bit of stew, just a mouse bite, into her mouth. It was too soon to eat it and hot, far too hot, and it scorched her tongue. She wasn't going to be able to taste anything for a couple of hours after that, but she didn't show it. She only looked at him, and waited for whatever it was that he was going to do.<br>He narrowed his eyes then, and she glimpsed the predator he'd tried to disguise under a charm mask.<br>"Where I come from it's polite to share if you've got food and someone else doesn't," he said.<br>"You don't say."<br>She spooned up some more stew, never taking her eyes from him. She was going to lose what was in the pot in a minute when he charged at her, and she was sorry for it, for she was hungry and it wasn't easy to carry those cans of stew around.<br>He pulled out the gun then, the one he'd been pretending not to finger the whole time.<br>"Give me what's in your bag, bitch," he snarled, his lips pulling back from his teeth.<br>Red calmly put the bowl in her lap to one side. "No."<br>"Give it to me or I'll shoot you," he said, waving the gun in her general direction.<br>He thought he was being menacing, and it made her snort. He looked like a cartoon villain in a movie, a mangy excuse for a badass-the kind that threaten the hero when he walks through an alley and get thrashed for their trouble. She wasn't dumb enough to think that he couldn't hurt her, though. Even an idiot with a gun was dangerous.<br>"Are you laughing at me?" His face twisted in fury as he stepped closer.<br>He was coming around the side where she'd rested the pot, as she'd expected. He was afraid of the axe, though he didn't want to acknowledge it, so he was giving the bloodied blade a wide berth. That was fine by Red.<br>"What's the matter, bitch? Scared?" he cooed. He mistook her silence for fear, apparently.<br>She waited, patient as a fisherman on a summer's day, until he was within arm's length. Then she grabbed the pot handle and stood as fast as she could, using her real leg and her free arm for force to push upward and tapping her other leg down only for balance once she was on her feet.<br>The trouble with the prosthetic was that it didn't spring-Red didn't have a fancy blade that could perform feats of athleticism-but she'd figured out how to compensate using her other leg. She needed to prevent the coyote from killing her for her food.<br>Her sudden movement arrested him, his gaze flying to the axe that he'd expected her to grab. Red could have, she supposed, stayed right where she was on the ground and embedded the blade in his thigh, but that might have resulted in a protracted struggle and she didn't want a struggle.<br>The goal was not to have a fancy movie fistfight that looked good from every angle. She wanted him down. She wanted him done. She wanted him unable to grab her.<br><br>Red flung the rest of the boiling stew in his face.<br><br>The intruder screamed, dropped his gun, and clawed at his skin. It blistered and bubbled, and she noticed she'd managed to hit one of his eyes. She didn't want to think about how horrible that felt because it looked like something awful. Red forced down the gorge that threatened at the smell of his burning flesh. She grabbed up the axe then and swung it into his stomach.<br><br>All the soft organs under his shirt gave way-she felt them squishing beneath the pressure of the blade, and hot blood spurted over her hands and then there was an even worse smell: the smell of what was supposed to be inside your body coming out, and she did cough then, felt the little mouse bite of her dinner coming back up mixed in with bile. It stopped her throat and made her whole body heave.<br><br>But Red wasn't about to let him get up again and come after her and so she pulled the axe straight across his torso before yanking it out. It made a squelching, sucking sound as it emerged. Red wasn't accustomed to that sound yet. No matter how many times she used the axe it made her skin crawl.<br><br>The man (for that was all he was after all, just a man, not a coyote, not a hunter) fell toward her and she backed away as quick as she could, no fancy acrobatics involved. Red was not some movie superhero any more than the man was a movie villain. She was just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that didn't look anything like the one she'd grown up in, the one that had been perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.<br>The man fell to the ground, and the blood seeped from the wound in his stomach. He didn't make any noise or twitch or anything dramatic like that, because he'd likely passed out once his brain was overwhelmed by the pain from his burn and the pain from the axe. He might live-unlikely, Red thought, but he might. He might die, and she was sorry not that she'd done it but that she had to do it.<br><br>Red didn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she wasn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she was a woman alone in the woods.<br><br>She gathered all of her things from the site, slung her pack on her back, doused the fire she'd so carefully built. She cleaned her axe as best she could with a cloth, then covered the blade and put the handle in a Velcro loop on her pants.<br><br>The gun her attacker had dropped gleamed in the faint starlight, and she reluctantly picked it up. If she left it behind, someone else might find it and that person might cause her trouble later. After all, she hadn't killed all three of the people she'd encountered earlier.<br><br>Red didn't know anything about guns except that she didn't like them. Her father had liked to watch crime television shows, and on those programs everyone seemed to know how to click the safety on and off and load the gun even if they'd never touched a weapon before. Red didn't have the faintest idea how to do any of that and she didn't want to fool with a gun in the dark. That seemed like an excellent way to shoot herself in the only organic foot she had remaining.

She lives New York City.<p>Wild Ride1</p><p>Calumet Farm sits on a high plateau in central Kentucky, a land of rolling savannahs known as the Bluegrass and the world center of the thoroughbred horse industry. Here, partly because of an accident of nature, breeders have produced more champion racehorses than on any other piece of land in the world.</p><p>The geological accident occurred more than 450 million years ago. At that time, while the eastern United States was still under water, great collisions on the earth&#x2019;s surface forced the formation of mountains where the Appalachians stand today. Over the next 200 million years, a pattern emerged: the mountains eroded, the collisions resumed, and new mountains rose, only to erode once again. As each range of mountains formed, the impact sent waves of the earth&#x2019;s crust westward. Of the many waves, one grew until it formed a high ground that consisted largely of limestone and measured fifty miles across and several hundred miles long, extending from what is now Ohio to southern Tennessee.</p><p>On the surface of this high ground was a dark brown soil, nourished by the limestone beneath it and uncommonly rich in phosphate from millions of deposits of shells and skeletons. The soil also contained an abundance of calcium, but it was the phosphate, normally found at such concentration only on ocean floors, that would dazzle geologists for centuries. The grass that grew from this soil was unique in its ability to nurture strong bones in the animals that grazed upon it. And the greatest concentration of the soil was in a 2,500-square-mile area whose center would someday be Fayette County, Kentucky, the heart of the Bluegrass.</p><p>Thousands of years after the first grass grew on the high plateau and many miles away, horse breeders in England began a centuries-long pursuit that would have as much impact on the future of the Bluegrass as geology. Their quest was the search for a new type of horse to take advantage of a new kind of weapon&#x2014;gunpowder.</p><p>Horses were used mainly to transport men, supplies, and weapons until the Normans, in 1066, won the Battle of Hastings with the help of superior horses. For several centuries thereafter, the breeding of a sturdy mount capable of carrying the 350-pound weight of a knight in full armor was a critical part of military strategy. But with the invention of gunpowder in the fourteenth century, armor became obsolete and armies needed fast, agile horses capable of darting quickly out of the range of fire. In the Middle Ages, though, the only light horses in England didn&#x2019;t have the stamina for war, while the strong horses were too slow.</p><p>For centuries the English tried, without success, to create the perfect steed. By the sixteenth century, not only armies sought the new breed, but horsemen did, too, because racing was growing in popularity, especially in the royal courts of James I, Charles II, and Queen Anne. For the inventive breeder who could find the right combination of speed and stamina, there were big profits to be made. The breakthrough came in the late seventeenth century when the English began breeding their mares to stallions from North Africa and the Middle East. From these matches came the &#x201c;invention&#x201d; of the thoroughbred horse.</p><p>Every thoroughbred&#x2019;s male line extends back to one of three sires: the Byerly Turk, the Darley Arabian, and the Godolphin Barb. Captain Richard Byerly captured the first of these, a black warhorse, during a 1688 battle in Turkey, shipping it to England in 1689. Around 1704 the merchant Thomas Darley purchased the second stallion in Syria and sent it to his brother, a breeder in England. By most accounts a North African ruler sent the third stallion, born in Yemen in 1724, as a gift to the king of France. But the king didn&#x2019;t like the looks of the horse and discarded it. A few years later, a Frenchman walking along the streets of Paris noticed a horse with welts on its back and wounds on its legs pulling a cart. He rescued the horse, which was the Yemen stallion, nursed it back to health, and sold it to the second earl of Godolphin, who then took the stallion to his farm in Newmarket, England, to breed with his finest mares.</p><p>The new breed ranged in size from fourteen hands&#x2014;a hand measures four inches&#x2014;to seventeen hands tall from ground to withers (the point where the base of the neck and top of the shoulder meet), with powerful muscles, especially in its hindquarters, to propel its stride. Bred for speed, it had a high-strung, fiery nature, which gave it the classification, in breeding parlance, of a &#x201c;hot blood,&#x201d; as opposed to a &#x201c;cold blood&#x201d; like the heavy animals used to support the armored knights and the horses that toiled in fields. A lithe, elegant animal with the grace of a gazelle and the endurance of a larger mammal, the thoroughbred was capable of carrying weight while running at high speeds.</p><p>During the last half of the eighteenth century hundreds of thoroughbred horses were shipped from England to the New World, where racing was in vogue and the demand for faster and faster horses was high. Horse racing had become so popular on the streets of colonial towns that it was considered a public nuisance. Soon tracks dotted the landscape from New York and Virginia to Maryland and the Carolinas. Even George Washington indulged; a 1772 diary entry shows that he had lost one-sixth of a pound at a track in Annapolis.</p><p>Thoroughbreds didn&#x2019;t arrive on Kentucky&#x2019;s high plateau until about 1800, thirty years after Daniel Boone&#x2019;s first expedition to what was then the untamed sector of Virginia. It was Boone, on his 1769 trip, who might have brought the first horses to the region, though they were probably only pack animals. Still, it was Boone&#x2019;s splendorous tales that lured others with better horses to the lush rolling savannas. Accounts of his two-year trip gushed with descriptions of a land covered with dark soil that grew an abundance of herbs, wild rye, and wild lettuce and that fed a bountiful supply of game, including turkey, deer, bear, and buffalo. There were walnut trees, blue ash, buckeyes, and the biggest oak trees he had ever seen.</p><p>Soon a rush of settlers from the Carolinas, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania crossed mountains and coal-filled valleys to settle on the high plateau. Most were from Virginia, where horsemen were by far the best among the New World&#x2019;s breeders, a skill they took to the new land. And although none knew of the events of 450 million years before or were aware of the unique composition of the soil and grass, early annals show they did acknowledge the weather as a significant factor in raising their horses. Similar to parts of England and Ireland, the high plateau was temperate. Foals and yearlings were spared the harsh cold of the North and the even harsher heat of the South. And the new grass of spring came in as early as mid-March, at least a month before what most of the settlers were accustomed to. This meant the grass was edible by late March or early April, giving newborn foals early nourishment, a head start for building strong bones.</p><p>The first time on record that the grass was referred to as &#x201c;the Bluegrass&#x201d; was apparently in a 1795 ad in the Kentucky Gazette, selling a plantation &#x201c;rich with the Bluegrass.&#x201d; Though the phosphate-rich soil gave the grass unique qualities and the term &#x201c;Bluegrass&#x201d; would help to market sales of the land and its products for centuries to come, the strain of grass itself was probably not indigenous to the high plateau, and it was not all that blue.</p><p>The grass was part of the Gramineae family and the genus Poa. In Kentucky the strain was Poa pratensis, which means literally meadow grass. It is unclear how it ended up in Kentucky; filling the gaps of historical fact is a mountain of folklore about its origins. Some say the grass came from England during the last twenty-five years of the eighteenth century. In one story, an Englishman who accompanied Boone to Kentucky brought the seed. Another tale claims a settler carried the seeds in a thimble from England. Yet another credits a man named Blue who supposedly migrated from Pennsylvania, spotted the grass already growing in Kentucky, and named it after himself. Another account attributes the label Bluegrass to a simple mixup of names. A strain of the same genus, Poa compressa, found in parts of Canada does in fact have a discernible blue tint.</p><p>The grass in Kentucky is remarkably thick and lush, growing eighteen inches to twenty-four inches tall and rippling in the wind in the same memorable way as a field of wheat in Kansas. Its deep green hue in springtime is startling in its intensity, especially on a sunny day. And in the early morning light, as the sun&#x2019;s rays reflect off dewy blades of grass, its tint is slightly mauve, which might be why some nineteenth-century landscape artists in Kentucky painted the grass in tones of pink. Just how blue it is differs from one account to another. Some locals say they&#x2019;ve never seen the blue. Others were told as children they could see blue grass on the night of a full moon if they stood in a field, bent over, and looked upside down between their legs. Still others say that the grass, when producing its tiny seeds and in full bloom, really does appear slightly blue usually for a week or ten days in late May or early June.</p><p>By the late eighteenth century, the first families of the Bluegrass&#x2014;the Alexanders, the Dukes, the Warfields, the Clays&#x2014;were planting their roots deep in Kentucky soil. Most who made the journey were English, Irish, Scottish, or Scotch-Irish. It was a group that stuck together in a remarkable way, living, working, loving, marrying, and begetting among themselves generation after generation.</p><p>The families came largely from Virginia. They were often wellborn, headed by the second and third sons of wealthy landowners who knew their older brothers would inherit the family land and so wanted their own manors and estates. They replicated the Doric-columned mansions of their homeland...</p></p><h2>Unconscious Putting: Dave Stockton&#39;s Guide to Unlocking Your Signature Stroke</h2><p><b>"The Pro Tours' Hottest Coach" (<i>Golf Digest</i>) reveals the secrets that helped Phil Mickelson win the 2010 Masters and can utterly transform every player's game. </b><p>When a resurgent Phil Mickelson won the Tour Championship in September 2009, he was quick to credit a series of simple putting lessons from veteran golf champion and instructor Dave Stockton. As a top coach, Stockton has taught a long list of pro players-including Annika Sorenstam, Yani Tseng (winner of four LPGA tournaments), Adam Scott (Texas Open champion), Hunter Mahan (Phoenix Open champion), and Morgan Pressel (World Ladies Championship of Japan winner)-the putting strategies that finessed their game.</p><p>Stockton's breakthrough concept is that every player has their own Signature Stroke, which is unconscious. Good putting comes from the mind, Stockton says, not from a series of stiff mechanical positions. With visualization, the right frame of mind, an efficient pre-putt routine, and connection to the individual internal stroke signature, any player can make far more putts. Putting has always been taught as an offshoot to the full swing, when in reality it is far different- almost a different game. <i>Unconscious Putting</i> will help players get out of the rigid, mechanical, overthinking trap.</p><p>In <i>Unconscious Putting</i>, Stockton shows how players at every handicap level-from pros to weekend golfers-can putt effortlessly and with confidence by integrating a new mental approach with a few simple physical routines that will keep them locked on target. Readers will also gain invaluable advice on reading greens and equipment. Illustrated throughout and filled with anecdotes about how Stockton's lessons have helped today's leading players, <i>Unconscious Putting</i> is a must-have golf book and a category classic-in-the-making.</p></p><p>MATTHEW RUDY has been a golf reporter at Sports Illustrated since 1995.

It might have been a postcard or a movie poster, and it was as eerie as ever&#x2014;a facade that graced the darkest horror movie. Its paint was chipping, the exterior was gray and it had been weathered through the centuries by icy winds ripping in off the Atlantic Ocean. The ground-floor windows seemed like black eyes; the second-floor windows might have been startled brows, half covered by the eaves of the roof.<br><br>Oddly enough, Lexington House had always remained in private hands. From its builder&#x2014;the Puritan Eli Lexington&#x2014;to its recent owner&#x2014;the now deceased Abraham Smith&#x2014;it had always found a new buyer after each and every one of its tragedies. People had once known its early history, of course, but that had been lost amid the witchcraft trials that scarred American history and continued to fascinate the social sciences. And when Mr. and Mrs. Braden had been brutally murdered two centuries later, in the 1890s, the world knew that their son had been guilty of the crime. But the legal system had worked for the killer this time, and he'd been acquitted. He and his sister had promptly sold the house to another private party. Eighty years later it had become a bed-and-breakfast, and then it had been purchased by Abraham Smith, who had longed for the property on its little cliff, segregated from all but a few neighbors.<br><br>One of whom had been murdered last week.<br><br>And now today...<br><br>Jenna Duffy had heard about nothing but the Lexington House on the radio since she'd started for Salem from Boston this morning.

There were no onlookers, though. The house was at a little distance from the historic section of town, where most visitors strolled through the Old Burial Ground, visited the House of the Seven Gables or sought out history at any one of the witch museums or the Peabody Essex Museum. And since it was October and Halloween was approaching, the real-life contemporary tragedy would fuel the ghost stories that were already being told around town.<br><br>She stared at the house awhile longer, wondering about its history. What happened at Lexington House would prove to be another horrible case of mental instability or greed, and as much as she longed to actually see the property that brought about such gruesome tragedy, she had a meeting with her uncle. She glanced at her watch and pulled back onto the road. With Halloween tourists clogging the city, it might take her time to get where she was going.<br><br>Somehow she was still early.<br><br>She parked her car at the Hawthorne Hotel's parking lot, and wandered across the street to the common.<br><br>Autumn leaves, beautiful in their warm orange, magenta and yellow colorings, rustled beneath Jenna's feet as she strolled. Before her and around her, the leaves swirled and lifted inches into the air as the breeze picked them up and whimsically tossed them about.<br><br>She heard the laughter of schoolchildren as they made their way through Salem Common, heading home but not too quickly. Autumn was certainly one of the most beautiful seasons in New England, and schoolchildren, raised with all the colors as they may have been, still loved to stop and lift the leaves, toss them about and roll in them.<br><br>Jenna had loved Salem since she'd first come to the States and her parents had chosen nearby Boston, Massachusetts, as the place to begin their new lives. They had come up here weekends, in the summers and for the Halloween festivity, and also for the fall leaves and to see Uncle Jamie.<br><br>But this was a difficult visit. She was about to meet Uncle Jamie at the Hawthorne Hotel, and she was worried about him. He'd been so anxious when he'd asked her to come. He was asking her in a professional capacity, but he didn't want her bringing "your <em>team" </em>or "your <em>unit" </em>or "the <em>official </em>group" with which she worked, not yet.<br><br>As she walked across the common, her attention was drawn back to the children. A group of five- to seven-year-olds were holding hands, running in a circle and playing a game.<br><br>She froze as she heard them reciting the old rhyme repeated not just in this area, but around the country.<br><br><em>Oh, Lexington, he loved his wife,</em><br><br><em>So much he kept her near.</em><br><br><em>Close as his sons, dear as his life;</em><br><br><em>He chopped her up;</em><br><br><em>He axed them, too,</em><br><br><em>and then he kept them here.</em><br><br><em>Duck, duck, wife!</em><br><br><em>Duck, duck, life!</em><br><br><em>You're it!</em><br><br>Jenna felt as if ice water had suddenly been injected in her veins&#x2014;the old ditty now seemed to be words of mockery and cruelty. A young woman, who had been standing with another group of parents watching over small children and a group of older teens who had gathered in the park, rushed forward. She caught hold of the little boy's arms, spun him around and shook a finger at him, reprimanding him.<br><br>Another of the mothers came hurrying over to her, her voice carrying in the cool air. "Cindy, don't be so hard on them! They don't...know. We used to say that rhyme all the time when we were kids."<br><br>"Samantha, I know, it's just that...now? Now, with what's happened again? It's that house! That horrible house, and that boy... He used to go to school with <em>our</em> kids."<br><br>"But, it's over now, Cindy. It's over. They have the boy in custody."<br><br>Other parents began calling out sharply to their children. The two women herded the children toward the group of parents. A tall man in the group said something sharply to the teens, words that Jenna couldn't quite hear, and they disbanded, as well. The conversation they all exchanged became whispers. The families and the unattached teens began to drift away, as if none of them wanted the reality of the situation.<br><br>The great seafaring days of Salem were in the past. The city survived on tourism, and most of it wasn't because of the autumn leaves. Salem had been the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials&#x2014;and it had also been the site of two horrendous and savage murdering sprees.<br><br>And, now, a third.<br><br>Tragic incidences of human ignorance and brutality in the past were one thing; bloodletting in the present was quite another, especially with the town anticipating the season's mammoth number of visitors. The income generated by the holiday alone could sustain many a shopkeeper and inn through the brutal New England winter to follow.<br><br>Of course, for Uncle Jamie, the recent tragedy would not be in any way fiscal but personal. She knew Jamie and loved him dearly, because he was a man who took the troubles of others to heart. This was often to his own detriment, but that was Jamie.<br><br>From her vantage spot, she could see the Salem Witch Museum with its English Gothic facade across the street on North Washington Square&#x2014;the point where she always told friends to begin their exploration of the city. In a comparatively short presentation, the museum did a fine job of explaining the climate of the city during the days of the infamous trials. The statue of Roger Conant, town founder, stood proud before her as well, larger than life, his heavy cape appearing to blow in the same breeze that tossed the leaves about.<br><br>The residences and businesses surrounding the common were decked out for fall. Pumpkins and black cats adorned windows and lawns, while skeletons and, naturally, witches dangled from branches. Some people were more into the traditional concept of fall itself, and they had decorated with scarecrows, feathered turkeys and cornucopias. The image of the city of Salem she saw as she stood in the common was that of old New England, family and festivity, tinged with the strange pleasant warmth of the coming of fall.<br><br>She glanced at her watch again. It was time to go and meet Uncle Jamie; she suddenly realized she had been dreading the meeting, and she didn't even know why.<br>Sam poured himself a second cup of coffee and looked around the house, trying to concentrate on its details and trying to make up his mind. He didn't like wondering what the hell he was going to do about the house, but it was better than thinking about the bizarre and tragic circumstances under which he had finally made it home.<br><br>He didn't need to get involved&#x2014;he wasn't staying here. He'd already taken a nice long leave of absence, and it was time to go back to work. But, then, he mused, maybe he shouldn't. He'd not only saved his client from prison, but he'd proved beyond a doubt that the man not only deserved to be declared innocent, but <em>was, </em>in fact, innocent. And he was still a bit worn down from all the effort.<br><br>Sam had really stepped on every rung of the ladder on his way to becoming a renowned attorney. He'd worked in the D.A.'s office following college and the military. He'd worked as an investigator as well before joining his first small firm, because his boss had needed an investigator more than another attorney in the office. He'd learned the ropes from Colin Blake, Esquire, and he'd come to terms with a sad truth: a defense attorney was still required to give his best effort in a legal defense, even if he thought his client was guilty as all hell. He'd learned to make the cops and the prosecutors suffer, but discovered he didn't much like that side of the business. Still, despite that, he wasn't sure he could ever go back to being a prosecutor. It wasn't the money. Well, it was <em>about </em>money. Often. It was sometimes about the money it took to put together a great team of defense attorneys. He'd seen a young woman sent to prison for years, convicted of the murder of her newborn. He'd seen a rich young man walk on drug charges, and a poor one sent up fifteen years for the same offense. He understood the law; he didn't understand why the slow wheels of Congress took so long to correct the inequities that were to be found in so many instances. He was violently opposed to the death penalty, always afraid that somewhere, sometime, it would send an innocent person to his or her death, and yet he understood the desire others felt to see it utilized. Too many drug lords, murderers and rapists made it back onto the street. But last night.<br><br>Something about the kid he'd come upon in the street was still tugging at his heartstrings.<br><br><em>The kid, according to police, had axed his family to death.</em><br><br>There was no doubt that Malachi Smith's father, mother, grandmother and great-uncle had been murdered, and horribly so. Jumping on the internet that morning, he'd seen that the news regarding the killings had gone global. Abraham Smith, sixty-two, Beth Smith, fifty-nine, Abigail Smith, eighty-three, and Thomas Smith, eighty-seven, had all died from exsan-guination&#x2014;Beth, Abigail and Thomas all receiving at least eight blows from a honed ax, Abraham over twenty. The previous week, a neighbor, Mr. Earnest Covington, had been found hacked to death on his parlor floor. Six months earlier, a Salem native living in nearby Andover had been found murdered in his barn. Police had been following leads and now suspected that the cases were related.<br><br>Indisputable evidence indicated that the youngest son of the Smith family, Malachi, was the killer. The police had the young man in custody, and he remained under guard in isolation at a correctional facility hospital.<br><br>The Smiths were the current owners of Lexington House, famed for its bloody reputation. The family had adhered to strict fundamentalist teachings, being members of the Old Meeting House in Beverly, Massachusetts. This was a strange connection of sorts with the original murders in the place. In the midst of the witchcraft trials, Eli Lexington had murdered his family with an ax. He'd been imprisoned with the nearly two hundred arrested for witchcraft at the time. Then he disappeared. There were no records of his fate after prison.<br><br>Then, in the late eighteen hundreds, Mr. and Mrs. Braden had been killed in the house, as well. A historical parallel of the Menendez case? From the books, movies and court records that had come down through time, it appeared that a disgruntled son had killed his parents for the money. And, of course, similar cases had been suspected elsewhere. The Braden case was similar, too, to the Lizzie Borden murders. Both Lizzie and the Braden boy had been acquitted, but nobody doubted that each of them had murdered their families.<br><br>Just like today's case.<br><br>Sam told himself over and over to get the hell away from his computer. He was <em>not </em>involved. But he was.<br><br>He'd found the kid in the road.<br><br>And, he'd grown up in Salem. He could still remember being a school kid, and the rhyme every school kid in the area had learned. <em>Oh, Lexington, he loved his wife...</em><br><br>A good attorney, of course&#x2014;even a hack&#x2014;would go for an insanity plea. The kid had grown up in what everyone in the area termed a haunted house&#x2014;<em>a really haunted house</em>&#x2014;which, in a city like Salem, was saying something.<br><br><em>Any attorney could defend the boy. It was too easy. </em>He forced himself to leave the computer screen and walk around the house.<br><br>His parents had been dead for nearly two years; he'd returned for the funeral, and he hadn't been back since. The house, however, was in excellent shape. His father, until his death, had seen to it that no electrical wires frayed, that the heating system was state-of-the-art and that every board that even seemed slightly damaged was replaced. His father's friend and contractor, Jimmy Chu, had kept the house in good repair during the two years. His dad had come from old Puritan stock, and he'd considered it an honor to care for the home that his parents had owned, just as his grandparents before them did. It wasn't one of the oldest houses in the area, but it ranked right in there with many of the homes surviving from the turn of the eighteenth century all the way into the twenty-first.<br><br>He smiled suddenly, shaking his head and taking a sip of the coffee he still held, untouched. "Darn you, Dad. You knew that I won't be able to sell the damned thing!"<br><br>A house&#x2014;in a city in which he no longer lived&#x2014;was a pain in the ass, no matter what. He guessed that his father had always figured he'd come home one day.<br><br>Well, he'd managed to, but on the wrong damned day. He dropped his head. He didn't want to be involved with a legal situation here.<br><br>But he couldn't blink without seeing in his mind's eye the blank brown eyes of the naked boy covered in blood and shaking on the road.<br><br></p><h2>Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy</h2><p><b>Get the story the Fake News media doesn't want you to hear in the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller: a withering indictment of the Deep State plot against Trump and a firsthand account of the real presidency, based on interviews with the Trump family and top administration officials. </b><b><br></b><b> </b>At this point in American history, we are the victims of a liberal sabotage of the presidency unlike anything we've ever witnessed.

A gorgeous, unsparing novel.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;A generational saga, a swashbuckling sailor&#x2019;s tale, and the account of a small town coming into modernity&#x2014;both Melville and Steinbeck might have been pleased to read it.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>New Republic</i><br><br>Hailed in Europe as an instant classic, <i>We, the Drowned </i>is the story of the port town of Marstal, Denmark, whose inhabitants sailed the world from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of the Second World War. The novel tells of ships wrecked and blown up in wars, of places of terror and violence that continue to lure each generation; there are cannibals here, shrunken heads, prophetic dreams, and miraculous survivals. The result is a brilliant seafaring novel, a gripping saga encompassing industrial growth, the years of expansion and exploration, the crucible of the first half of the twentieth century, and most of all, the sea.<br><br>Called &#x201c;one of the most exciting authors in Nordic literature&#x201d; by Henning Mankell, Carsten Jensen has worked as a literary critic and a journalist, reporting from China, Cambodia, Latin America, the Pacific Islands, and Afghanistan. He lives in Copenhagen and Marstal.</p><p><p>Carsten Jensen&#x2019;s debut novel has taken the world by storm. Already hailed in Europe as an instant classic, <i>We, the Drowned</i> is the story of the port town of Marstal, whose inhabitants have sailed the world&#x2019;s oceans aboard freight ships for centuries. Spanning over a hundred years, from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of the Second World War, and from the barren rocks of Newfoundland to the lush plantations of Samoa, from the roughest bars in Tasmania, to the frozen coasts of northern Russia, <i>We, the Drowned</i> spins a magnificent tale of love, war, and adventure, a tale of the men who go to sea and the women they leave behind.</p><p>Ships are wrecked at sea and blown up during wars, they are places of terror and violence, yet they continue to lure each generation of Marstal men fathers and sons away. Strong, resilient, women raise families alone and sometimes take history into their own hands. There are cannibals here, shrunken heads, prophetic dreams, forbidden passions, cowards, heroes, devastating tragedies, and miraculous survivals everything that a town like Marstal has actually experienced, and that makes <i>We, the Drowned</i> an unforgettable novel, destined to take its place among the greatest seafaring literature.</p> <br> <strong>A Q &amp; A with Author Carsten Jensen</strong> <br><br> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>We, the Drowned</i> has become an international sensation. Are you surprised at the universal appeal of this story? </p> <p><b>A:</b> I had already worked for a couple of years on <i>We, the Drowned</i> when my female cousin asked me a very unsettling question. Do you really think, she asked me, that this novel of yours is going to interest anyone outside of our little island?</p> <p>I could only say: I hope so, but there was no way I could know. I did everything I could to see the universal aspects of the history of a little seafaring town on a forgotten island in a remote corner of the Baltic. But I had to admit it was a very local story, and maybe that was what interested me: the meeting between the local and the global, because that is what the sailor is: somebody who goes everywhere. The sailor is a universal figure.</p> <p>But writing a novel is always taking a risk. You never know whether there is anyone out there until you have tried reaching them. The sailor often sails into the unknown. So does the writer.</p> <p><b>Q:</b>What is it about sailing, the allure of the sea, that draws so many men, and you to write about it? What do you think is the modern equivalent of taking to the sea?</p> <p><b>A:</b> A farmer in a traditional farming community is not drawn to the soil. He has no choice. Neither had the sailors of Marstal. This was the only livelihood open to them. Whether they decided to enlist on the <i>Seagull</i> or the <i>Albatros</i>, that was all the choice they had. There was nothing romantic about it. </p> <p>After the book was published I was invited to have coffee with the Admiral of the Danish Navy, Niels Vang, who turned out to be a great fan of the book. The only people today laboring under the same harsh conditions as the sailors in your book, he said to me, are professional soldiers. They are the only ones confronted with the possibility of dying on the job in the same way that your sailors were.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You have called the sailor the forefather of globalization. Do you, as a journalist, relate to the sailor? </p> <p><b>A:</b> When the sailor returned to his hometown he knew one thing the farmers back home never knew: that there was more than one way of doing things. The farmer thought he was the center of the world, the sailor knew he wasn&#x2019;t. I think this a healthy knowledge.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How did you research the novel, which spans 100 years and many oceans?</p> <p><b>A:</b> I did a lot of research for the book, but I also made a lot of things up. I was helped by the sailor&#x2019;s museum of Marstal, a totally homegrown, very eccentric museum. They have an amazing archive, and when I dove into it, I realized that within the last 20 to 30 years, one half of the inhabitants of Marstal have done nothing but interview the other half.</p> <p>Then, together with the local public library, I organized a lot of town meetings where I read from the work in progress and explained my ideas. The people of Marstal, being very curious, showed up in great numbers. I made it clear to them that this was part of a deal: I would give them a book about their town, but I needed their help, too. So I was invited home, seated in the sofa, served coffee, and then I was presented with old letters, diaries, and unpublished memories meant for only the closest family. All this became a huge source of inspiration for me. It also meant that the whole town really ended up feeling that this was their book as much as mine.</p> <p>And after the publication of the book, many of the townspeople told me that they had heard all the stories in the book as children, and I said: But you can&#x2019;t have because I made them up. I was inspired, yes, but not to the extent that I just wrote everything I heard. But people could no longer distinguish reality from fiction.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>We, the Drowned</i> is written in first person plural, as a collective consciousness of the people of Marstal. Why did you choose to write the book this way? </p> <p><b>A:</b> The "we" telling the story represents the collective memory of the town, but not everybody is included. It is the memory of the men, since the lives of men and women are so dramatically different in a seafaring community. The women have their own separate story slowing unfolding in the novel alongside that of the men. </p> <p>The "we" is a kind of Greek chorus forever present on the stage, always commenting and introducing, but as a storyteller the "we" is also involved in the story, partial and taking sides, which means that it is not always reliable.</p> <p>The "we" seems all-knowing, but how can it know the most intimate things that go on between people? Well, maybe it doesn&#x2019;t know. What you don&#x2019;t know in a small community you invent and that is also called gossip. Gossip is an essential part of people&#x2019;s lives, and this is what I want my novel to mirror. It is full of real history, fiction, and gossip, too, because that is how the world works.</p> <p></p> <br> <br>HMH&nbsp;Hardcover, 2011978-0-15-101377-7</p><h2>Racing to the Finish: My Story</h2><p><p><strong><em>Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#x2019;s only authorized book revealing the inside track on his final year of racing and retirement from the driver&#x2019;s seat.</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Time was running out on my charade...

For the first time, he shares these notes and fully reveals the physical and emotional struggles he faced as he fought to close out his career on his own terms.</p><p>In this candid reflection, Earnhardt opens up about his frustration with the slow recovery, his admiration for the woman who stood by him through it all, and his determination to share his own experience so that others don&#x2019;t have to suffer in silence.

Named Rags for his disheveled appearance, the little stray quickly finds a home with Donovan and a place in his heart. Although the Army did not have an official canine division, Rags accompanies Donovan to the battlefield, making himself a useful companion delivering messages and providing a much-appreciated morale boost to the soldiers. News about Rags spreads and soon the little dog&#39;s battlefield exploits become the stuff of legend. But during a fierce battle near the end of the war, both Rags and Donovan are wounded. Severely injured, Donovan is sent back to the United States. And the little dog with the big heart refuses to leave his best friend&#39;s side.</p><p>Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;This heartfelt story introduces a heroic and lovable dog that was found in a Paris doorway by an American soldier during World War I. Private James Donovan and Rags became fast friends, and Rags was whisked off into U.S. Army service, where he learned to root out rats and mice from the trenches, transport important messages across the battlefield, and even to salute his superiors. The picture-book format and accessible narrative make for excellent storytime sharing. There has been a spate of books about dogs serving in wars recently, including Sheila Keenan's graphic novel Dogs of War (Scholastic, 2013) and Ann Bausum's Stubby the War Dog (National Geographic, 2014), both for slightly older students and offering more context and historical information. Rags is a fine introduction to the notion of dogs being included in military service for younger elementary students. The artwork is lively and sweet, with a soft palette of colors depicting many of the scenes. It breathes life into the text and creates an endearing character in Rags. An epilogue and author's note add some detail to the story, but no bibliographic or source information is included.

Valleys are nothing new for any of us. Some of you may be in a valley right now, or, since you never know what&#x2019;s around the corner, you may be on the brink of tottering into yet another valley. Or maybe you&#x2019;ve just survived a valley that you swear you&#x2019;ll never revisit&#x2014;but guess what? That&#x2019;s precisely the valley you&#x2019;ll probably see again.

You just need a little faith in yourself and a little guidance to find that faith within yourself. <br> <br>When you are at your wit&#x2019;s end, take this little book and let it guide you toward the ever-present but often elusive light at the end of the tunnel. <i>Faith in the Valley</i> is designed to help you find the light when you need it most&#x2014;when you&#x2019;re in that damn tunnel. When you&#x2019;re most confused and in the dark and clueless as to how you got there (again!) and when you&#x2019;re trying to figure out not just how to get out, but stay out. For good. <br> <br><i>Faith in the Valley</i> has helped so many through so much that we felt it only fitting to issue this lovely gift edition to acknowledge the special place it holds in many hearts. Please share it with a friend who has served as your beacon in the past, or offer it to yourself as a reminder of the strength and wisdom you possess and can offer to others. <br> <br>Iyanla</p><p>Rev.

It does not always look or feel this way. Instead, what we experience in life seems difficult, painful, unnecessary. Just for a moment, think of the stones which were used to build the pyramids and the gems which fashion the Crown Jewels. Imagine how the stones were dug from the quarry and then hammered and chiseled into shape. Realize that each stone or gem had to be perfectly shaped before it could be set in its appropriate place. Recognize that once the pyramids were built and jewels cast into the Crown, they have never been disturbed, nor have they shifted, fallen, or crumbled.<br><br>Somehow life teaches us to understand that God has a perfect plan for us; according to that plan, we must be molded and shaped prior to being cast into our perfect place. When we truly recognize that there is a master plan, we can welcome any tool that comes to prepare us to behold our perfect place. When we are shaped and molded by life according to God's perfect plan, the world is amazed and blessed by our beauty, and longevity.<br><br><i>Get prepared to be prepared!</i><br><br>Right where you are is where you need to be. Don't fight it! Don't run away from it! Stand firm! Take a deep breath. And another. And an-other. Stop beating up on yourself. Don't blame anyone else. Breathe. Now, ask yourself.' Why is this in my world? What do I need to see? To know about myself through this situation? Breathe again. Now, ask God:<br><br>Blessed and Divine Father/Mother, heal me of whatever thought or belief has contributed to the cause of this experience. Bring me the lesson of this experience lovingly and gently. Keep my mind and heart open that I may know the truth. Open my eyes that I may recognize your will. Thank you, God.<br><br>Now breathe. Don't you feel better already?<br><br><i>God is right here, right now!</i><br><br>Bad things are going to happen. Painful, ugly, frustrating events are going to take place. There is no way around getting your feelings hurt, having your ego bruised, your trust weighed, your heart broken. Life has its ups and downs. If you are hying, you are bound to trip or fall every now and then. There is not much you can do while you are going through your challenges and difficulties, but there is something you can remember that will make it a bit easier to bear.<br><br>The same God that was good yesterday is good today. The same God that loved you last week, loves you today. The same powerful, almighty, all-knowing God that saved you, comforted you, guided you the last time you needed it, will save, comfort, and guide you today. Bight where you are, in the midst of trouble, take a moment to be loved, comforted, guided, by the good God who knows exactly what you need. God is present. God's presence is called grace.<br><br><i>Live in the presence of God's grace.</i><br><br>When my husband left, I thought I had been a bad wife. Then my son went to jail, and I knew I had been a bad mother. When my best friend and my mother died, I slipped face first into being a bad person. How was I supposed to figure it all out?<br><br>All women fall into the valley. Some fall deeper than others. The valley is a lonely place. A dark and confusing pit in the center of your brain. You can't figure it out. You can't get out. You've got a black hole in your life into which everything you've ever really wanted seems to fall, into the valley. I once thought it was cruel and inhumane punishment; now I know it is a reward. The stronger and more gifted you axe, the deeper and eventually more rewarding is the valley experience.<br><br>We all have our lessons to learn in life. Most of us fail to learn unless we are in some kind of pain. The valley is your pain. The valley gets your attention. The valley lets you know what you are doing and why you just might want to try something new. The bad thing is that no one can warn you a valley is coming. You must pay attention to what is going on in your life! The good thing is that once you've been there, in enough pain, you figure it out. People begin to notice. "Hey, what's up with you?" "You look different." "Did you change your hair or something?" You haven't changed your hair, your mind has changed. You have learned a very valuable lesson. When you can't, FAITH CAN!<br><br><i>Faith makes the day and paves the way!</i><br><br>Dear Self, Guilt says, "There is something wrong with what I have done."<br><br>Shame says, "There is something wrong with me."<br><br>You can eliminate guilt by making amends for what you have done.<br><br>You cannot eliminate shame until you know and believe, "All that God is, I Am."<br><br>God is truth, mercy, wisdom, strength, forgiveness, peace, order, justice, and love.<br><br>What have you got to be ashamed of?<br><br><i>God is not ashamed of me. Neither am I.</i><br><br><i>You can't shrink into greatness.</i> When you reflect on the things you have done and not done, there is a tendency to beat up on yourself. We criticize, judge, and condemn ourselves much more severely than the world could or would. In response to this self-flagellation, we shrink away from doing or attempting to do. You cannot shrink into your greatness! We must use our past as a road map, a key, that unlocks our capabilities by giving us understanding of our frailties. The past simply tells us what we can do, cannot do, what we need to work on or work out.<br><br>You must know every intricate detail of yourself. Your past is like an X-ray machine. Once you see what is there, don't shrink, shine! Now you know, which means you can take appropriate steps toward healing and correction. Don't fight with yourself! Accept who you are now and all you've done. Then give yourself a big hug and kiss. You've been through a lot. A little loving tenderness could be what you need right now.<br><br><i>I love to love me.</i><br><br>Repetition is the mother of skill. If you do something enough you get good at it. When what you are doing is good for you, it is pleasurable, and you want to do it often, getting better and better at it. However, when what we do is not pleasurable, we fight against it, resisting the discomfort, and avoiding the lesson we may need to learn.<br><br>When unwanted situations repeat themselves in our lives, there is something we have missed. There is a blind spot in our consciousness, something we can't see and don't know yet. Repeat performances of bad productions will continue coming up as an experience in our lives. We go through it again, again, wracking our brains, grasping at straws, trying to figure out how we got here and how we can get out.<br><br>Those repetitive issues which cause us displeasure are just like the things Mother told us over and over. We didn't want to hear them; we ignored what she said. In the end, we saw Mother's point. Finally, we realized, she only wanted us to be better; well, so does life. When you find yourself in the same situation repeatedly, do not fight against what you are going through. It is in your own best interest to look for the lesson and cultivate the skill, to do a new thing, in a new way.<br><br><i>I Am, I Am, I Am, I know I Am, learning something very valuable.</i><br><br>Little problems in life are like a pop quiz which will determine whether or not you are in touch with your feelings; whether you have learned to trust yourself or will continue to move along mindlessly in your old ways. Many of us ignore the little things, those uneasy rumblings, because we can't believe it is happening...again. We step willingly into bad situations, because we don't want to believe we could be "wrong" about them. Yet we readily believe we could be "wrong" about what we feel. If you don't believe yourself, when you don't trust what you feel, it means you are in doubt. Doubt will push you headfirst into a valley.<br><br>Sometimes an uneasy feeling will be the normal fear or doubt associated with doing things that are different or new. At other times, it will be life warning you to get still, pay attention, remember what happened the last time you didn't pay attention to yourself, and act accordingly.<br><br>Here is a clue about life's little warnings: monsters don't have shadows! You will never see the monster coming. It will descend upon you before you recognize it. If you are feeling uneasy for no apparent reason, it means you are being quizzed about something you are adequately equipped to handle, based on past experience. Whether you pass or fail the quiz is a reflection of how much you know about and trust yourself.<br><br><i>Trust what you feel!</i><br><br>When you get the urge to stay home, be alone, pull back, or shut down, it is probably your spirit urging you to take a rest. Do not ignore it! Honor yourself by taking some time out. Take a day away. There may be something very important going on within you that you need to know about. You must get quiet in order to hear it. The job will be there, and people will simply have to understand; what can be done today can also be done tomorrow. All duties and responsibilities can wait. Your spirit cannot!<br><br>I have often heard people say, "I need a break!" but they never take one. I know it is no coincidence when these same people break their foot or when their car breaks down, forcing them to "be still." Often we think there is something wrong with us when we "don't want to be bothered." So we keep moving and doing. Spirit knows what we need and provides it for us. Yet when incidents force us into a needed solitude, we reach outward rather than within. Rest, Stillness, Solitude, Introspection, Reflection, are spiritual vibrations. They keep us from breaking down, falling apart, and being forced into a living deficiency.<br><br><i>Today is a spiritual health day!</i><br><br>Dear God,<br><br>Today, I want to be still, to listen, to hear, and to know. Today, I want to see and know myself as a reflection of You. Today, God, I want the stillness of Your love to shower me in the light of perfect peace, that I may go forth stronger, wiser, in readiness to do Your perfect will. Today, God, I want to be still with You.<br><br>Lord, keep me still today! Take away all that makes me race and worry and fear and doubt and rush away from myself. Take away the need to do, be, have, know, want anything other than the grace of Your love. Show me myself today, Lord. Show me Your perfect child, on a divine mission, fulling Your perfect purpose, in a divine way. And, Lord, help me understand You and me, how we can work together in stillness to create new life.<br><br>Today, Lord, I am willing to be still in Your arms, still in Your light, still in Your love. I am willing to see You in me and release all that is not. I am willing to know You in my life, to preserve You in my heart, to open myself to more of You as what I am. In stillness I see You. In stillness I accept You. In stillness I feel You. Lord, let me be still, just for today. Thank You, God.<br><br><i>Today, move in stillness.</i><br><br>Everybody needs to go home every now and then. To go home means there is something waiting for you: Momma's love. To go home means having your favorite foods, cooked and waiting. It means lively conversation, laughter, some oldies but goodies playing in the background. Home is sitting back in an overstuffed chair, wrapped in a ragged blanket, watching reruns on TV. Home is a hot bubble bath and a fresh-smelling bed. Home is curling up next to Momma, resting your head in her lap, and telling her all your troubles and fears while she gently strokes your brow. Why not go home to Momma today? You can cook. You have a radio or an old tape to play. Get that old blanket out of the box. Take a nice warm bath and curl up in the bed. God the Mother is waiting to hear from you.<br><br><i>Mother, I'm coming home.</i><br><br>In ancient times, it was believed that little boys needed special protection in life. Boys were covered in blue. Blue represents the heavens. When you covered a baby boy in blue, you were providing him the energy and protection of God. It was also thought that girls did not require, or even "deserve," the same protection. Girls were fragile. Girls were meant to serve and be protected by boys. Girls were covered in pink to represent their sweet, fragile nature.<br><br>As silly as this may sound, it represents the dominant thought pattern of our culture. Boys are entitled to the world of God. Girls get ignored, pushed aside, abused, or abandoned by the boys. Don't they deserve special recognition themselves? You can begin today.<br><br>Remind your little girl, it is not what she wears, it is not the ribbons in her hair. It is not the color of her skin, the ruffles on her panties, or the neighborhood she lives in. Little girls are also expressions of God; this makes them worthy to the world. Little girls are valuable because they are; not because of what they do, what they have, or what they want to be. Little girls bring forth the grace of life in their smiles, laughter, questions, and expressions. There is a little girl in you. Have you loved her today? Have you hugged or kissed her today? Have you told her how special she is, how valuable she is, and how much you appreciate and honor her? Have you told the little girl in you how beautiful she is just because she is!<br><br><i>It is safe for you to be a little girl.</i><br><br>No one wants to be alone when things are not going well. Whether we fall or are pushed into one of life's difficulties, we don't want to be there on our own. In the darkness of trouble, we reach out for someone to help us. If we are lucky, they can't! They may want to, but there is simply no way anyone else can learn our lessons with us or for us.<br><br>If you are a slow learner, you might get mad at friends you think should help but don't. You may become disillusioned or resentful of the family members who always call on you but never answer when you call. If you are a spiritual special-education candidate, you may complain or whine and stamp your feet, declaring, "Why me?" "This is not fair!" "I can't take this anymore!" Oh, you can take it! We can always take the dark, lonely, frightening valley experience, because we have no other choice!<br><br>Your blessings have your name on them; so do your lessons! Your greatest blessing appears before you, cleverly disguised as your most difficult challenge, as your greatest obstacle, or as an extremely negative experience you are forced to handle all by yourself. What a blessing! What a blessed opportunity to face the truth, forgive yourself and others, practice faith, develop trust, be still, and know, "Right where I am, God is!"<br><br><i>I Am not alone! I Am learning!</i><br><br>Where did we get the idea that we must do it "all" alone? There is a guardian angel called the "Grace of God" waiting to serve us whenever we have need. So many of us struggle through life completely ignorant of the fact that the "Love of God" is sufficient protection, support, and supply under all circumstances. Far too many of us take on more than we need or want to, and by doing so, we get in God's way.<br><br>At all times, no matter what situation may confront us, "grace" is our escape route. With a long, deep breath, relaxation of the stomach muscles, and the silent affirmation "By the grace of God" we are given a clear mind and divine guidance. Often this brief exercise provides us with a new insight or renewed strength. Sometimes it lets us know that there is absolutely nothing we can do, and even this is o...</p><h2>Blues for Mister Charlie: A Play</h2><p>In a small Southern town, a white man murders a black man, then throws his body in the weeds. With this act of violence--which is loosely based on the notorious 1955 killing of Emmett Till--James Baldwin launches an unsparing and at times agonizing probe of the wounds of race. For where once a white storekeeper could have shot a "boy" like Richard Henry with impunity, times have changed. And centuries of brutality and fear, patronage and contempt, are about to erupt in a moment of truth as devastating as a shotgun blast.<br><br>In his award-winning play, Baldwin turns a murder and its aftermath into an inquest in which even the most well-intentioned whites are implicated--and in which even a killer receives his share of compassion.</p><p>"A play with fires of fury in its belly, tears of anguish in its eyes, a roar of protest in its throat." --The New York Times<br><br>"Explosive, eloquent, honest.... To read it is devastating." --San Francisco Chronicle<b>James Baldwin&nbsp;</b>(1924&#x2013;1987) was a novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic. His first novel,&nbsp;<i>Go Tell It on the Mountain,</i>&nbsp;appeared in 1953 to excellent reviews, and his essay collections&nbsp;<i>Notes of a Native Son&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Fire Next Time&nbsp;</i>were bestsellers that made him an influential figure in the growing civil rights movement. Baldwin spent much of his life in France, where he moved to escape the racism and homophobia of the United States. He died in France in 1987, a year after being made a Commander of the French Legion of Honor.</p><h2>Well Fed 2: More Paleo Recipes for People Who Love to Eat</h2><p><i>Well Fed 2: More Paleo Recipes For People Who Love To Eat</i> is the follow-up to the best-selling original Well Fed, and it's packed with even more internationally-inspired recipes, mouth-watering photos, and easy meal ideas. <br><br> All 200 recipes and Quick Meal ideas in <i>Well Fed 2</i> are made with zero grains, legumes, soy, sugar, dairy, and alcohol&#x2014;without sacrificing fun and flavor.

That year, she also underwent a thyroidectomy. In the aftermath of the surgery and recovery, she became particularly interested in how diet affects hormones, body composition, mood, and motivation.

What is less known is that a boy by the name of Nicholas Young was a stowaway on that ship.<p>Newbery winner Karen Hesse re-creates Cook's momentous voyage through the eyes of this remarkable boy, creating a fictional journal filled with fierce hurricanes, warring natives, and disease, as Nick discovers new lands, incredible creatures, and lifelong friends.</p></p><p>To 11-year-old Nicholas Young, the tall masts of the exploratory ship <i>Endeavour</i> look like an answer to his fervent prayers. On the run from his demanding father and the cruel butcher who employed him, Nick finds adventure beyond his wildest imaginings when he stows away on the ship of legendary Captain James Cook. Once he is discovered and put to work, Nick becomes party to some amazing sights. He meets indigenous natives of Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, wonders at the sight of kangaroos, and shudders with horror when confronted with cannibalism. Nick survives a hurricane, a near shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef, and a deadly bout with typhoid to become one of the few original crew members to successfully circumnavigate the globe with Cook and arrive safely back in England. He notes in his worn journal shortly before sighting his homeland's shore: "We have truly led the way, charting the path for all who come after. I don't know I shall ever feel so again as I feel now. That any of us shall."<p> Newbery Medal-winning Karen Hesse's story is based on actual <i>Endeavour</i> stowaway Nicholas Young, about whom little is known. Using the real 1768 diaries of Captain Cook and shipboard naturalist Joseph Banks, Hesse has changed Young from a forgotten footnote into a living, breathing person with red hair and a penchant for pork chops.

In this much-anticipated second edition, the authors reassert that the Old Testament should be taken seriously as a historical document alongside other literary and archaeological sources.</p><p>Significantly revised and updated, <i>A Biblical History of Israel, Second Edition</i> includes the authors' direct response to critics. In part 1, the authors review scholarly approaches to the historiography of ancient Israel and negate arguments against using the Bible as a primary source. In part 2, they outline a history of ancient Israel from 2000 to 400 BCE by integrating both biblical and extrabiblical sources. The second edition includes updated archaeological data and new references. The text also provides seven maps and fourteen tables as useful references for students.</p></p><p><b>Iain Provan</b> is the Marshall Sheppard Professor of Biblical Studies at Regent College.<br><b>V. Philips Long</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Old Testament at Regent College.<p>"The history of Israel and the relevance of the biblical testimony to understanding it continue to be contested areas. Building on the work of their previous edition by clarifying points of dispute and updating their discussion, Provan, Long, and Longman offer a thoughtful and well-reasoned argument in favor of giving serious attention to the Bible's own testimony. A crucial element of this must therefore be a careful reading of the text itself, one that takes seriously its own forms and agenda, because only when this is done can the Bible's testimony be evaluated. One of the real strengths of this work is the way in which it integrates careful exegesis with its wider discussion of historiography and history. This discussion is irenic and well-informed, showing that all our sources for Israel's history need to be interrogated for their testimony. The result is a volume that is epistemologically and methodologically sophisticated and yet accessible to a wider readership and which presents a strong case for making use of the Bible in understanding Israel's history. This should be a standard work for years to come." <br>&#x2014;David G. Firth, Lecturer in Old Testament and Director of Studies, St. John's College in Nottingham, England</p><br><br><p>"A sober, disciplined, well-reasoned response to the so-called minimalists who have dominated recent discussion of the history of ancient Israel. <i>A Biblical History</i> correctly insists that the 'historical reliability' of ancient texts largely depends on which testimonies to trust. The consequence is that the skepticism that has long dominated Old Testament discussion can no longer claim a privileged position&#x2014;either epistemologically or morally&#x2014;but in fact is an ideological advocacy. This book will need to be taken seriously and will be welcomed by all those who engage such issues of the historicity of the biblical text." <br>&#x2014;Walter Brueggemann, William Marcellus McPheeters Professor Emeritus of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary </p><br><br></p><h2>The Lords of Strategy: The Secret Intellectual History of the New Corporate World</h2><p>Imagine, if you can, the world of business - without corporate strategy. <br><br>Remarkably, fifty years ago that's the way it was. Businesses made plans, certainly, but without understanding the underlying dynamics of competition, costs, and customers. It was like trying to design a large-scale engineering project without knowing the laws of physics. <br><br>But in the 1960s, four mavericks and their posses instigated a profound shift in thinking that turbocharged business as never before, with implications far beyond what even they imagined. In The Lords of Strategy, renowned business journalist and editor Walter Kiechel tells, for the first time, the story of the four men who invented corporate strategy as we know it and set in motion the modern, multibillion-dollar consulting industry:<br><br>Bruce Henderson, founder of Boston Consulting Group<br>Bill Bain, creator of Bain &amp; Company<br>Fred Gluck, longtime Managing Director of McKinsey &amp; Company<br>Michael Porter, Harvard Business School professor<br>Providing a window into how to think about strategy today, Kiechel tells their story with novelistic flair. At times inspiring, at times nearly terrifying, this book is a revealing account of how these iconoclasts and the organizations they led revolutionized the way we think about business, changed the very soul of the corporation, and transformed the way we work.</p><p>Walter Kiechel III has been the editorial director of Harvard Business Publishing and the managing editor at Fortune magazine. He has written articles and columns on all aspects of business, and is the author of a previous book, Office Hours: A Guide to the Managerial Life (Little, Brown, 1989). He received AB, MBA, and JD degrees from Harvard, and served five years in the U.S. Navy.<br>A business journalist cogently presents his ideas on how the international corporate world should carry out strategic planning. The author painstakingly researched the inside stories of the prime movers in several well-known consulting firms, such as the Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and others. Narrator Robertson Dean&#39;s warm baritone is well matched to the content, enhancing it and holding listener interest. Dean&#39;s use of nuance and moderate pacing works well for Kiechel&#39;s discussion of the impact and relevance of strategic planning consultants. Business students and leaders alike will benefit from this thoughtful consideration of the practice of using outsiders to help create change.

In these chapters we learn about how and why we see color, the nature of rainbows, animals with color vision far superior and far inferior to our own, how our language influences the colors we see, and much more. Between these chapters, authors Joann Eckstut and Ariele Eckstut turn their attention to the individual hues of the visible spectrum?red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet?presenting each in fascinating, in-depth detail.<br><br>Including hundreds of stunning photographs and dozens of informative, often entertaining graphics, every page is a breathtaking demonstration of color and its role in the world around us.

She lives in Montclair, New Jersey.Starred Review. Where does the phrase blue blood come from? Why do most doctors wear green scrubs? These and other questions are answered in the Eckstut&amp;'s fascinating study of color. After throwing readers into the deep end with scientific explanations about how our brains process information and declarations like wavelengths of light do not exist as color until we see them, the authors move on to more accessible and lively examinations of colors and the roles they&amp;'ve played in history as well as evolution. Each hue gets a biography of sorts, as the authors examine its cultural (the Egyptians placed a high value on blue and it was one of the first synthetic pigments) and in some cases biological significance (different colors attract different animals). The science behind rainbows and why they never appear the same way to two people; why the grass is always greener across the street (you&amp;'re not seeing the imperfections); and a litany of other color-related trivia round out the book. The book&amp;'s dynamic design and short entries make it easy to skim, but it&amp;'s likely that those intending just a casual perusal will find themselves engrossed by this terrifically entertaining and informative volume.

A father pumps his son full of steroids so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor.</p></p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, March 2008: </b> A quick Internet search for "Knockemstiff, Ohio" reveals a lazy nexus of shabby houses and dirt roads in southern Ohio, lacking a post office and grocery store, but rich in legends of epic fistfights and swamp-dwelling ghosts. Donald Ray Pollock, a native of this "ghost town," populates his own <i>Knockemstiff</i> with living revenants: huffers, murderers, sex fiends, and their hapless (though not innocent) victims, all tethered to the woebegone "holler" by their own self-inflicted shortcomings and depravities. Pollock pulls no punches--his prose is blunt and visceral, as well as stylish and skilled--and reading these mini <i>grand guignols</i> can be like crunching on a mouthful of your own broken teeth. He resists casting judgment (or sympathy) on his doomed reprobates; predator or prey (or sometimes both), Pollock contemplates his characters with all the warmth of a "frozen bleach bottle."

Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;parents are amazed at the enthusiasm and excitement&nbsp;&nbsp;with which their child greets the&nbsp;&nbsp;world.<br>However, eight is also a time when the child&nbsp;&nbsp;begins to do a great deal of analyzing and&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluating, finding fault in himself and&nbsp;&nbsp;others--especially Mohter. How do parents help an eight-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;through this up-and-down age? What should parents&nbsp;&nbsp;expect in their relationships with the child and&nbsp;&nbsp;how can life in the family be made easier? What&nbsp;&nbsp;will the child's relationship with friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;siblings be like?

Unlike the child at Seven, he does not withdraw when the going gets tough. On the contrary, he remains right out in front, meeting every challenge that life throws his way.<br> &nbsp;<br> With his typically outgoing, expansive nature, an Eight-year-old is much more responsive to his environment than at Seven. With his high energy level, he seems willing to tackle almost anything, even the new and difficult. He is expanding emotionally, growing out of his earlier shyness, and relating to other people more easily than he used to. He even approaches strangers with some confidence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight&#x2019;s liveliness, or speed, is obvious to almost any adult. He darts around the house or yard, seemingly unaware of physical obstacles in his path. His entire body seems ready for action. He works fast, plays fast (loves running games), talks fast, even eats fast. When necessary he can shift very rapidly from one activity to the next, and wastes little time in looking back.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though at times his expansiveness and speed lead to carelessness, these usually don&#x2019;t cause the Eight-year-old too much difficulty. However, his evaluativeness certainly does. It makes him all too aware of his own failures. Eight tends to be hard on himself for his mistakes. His evaluativeness also makes him all too aware when other people do not respond as he would like them to. Eight is extremely sensitive to perceived criticism of others. On the other hand, this evaluativeness sometimes helps him make sound judgments as to what he can or cannot accomplish, when he is or isn&#x2019;t going to be successful. This helps to curb his headlong rush into things and can sometimes prevent him from undertaking the totally impossible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Intellectually, as in other ways, Eight is becoming more expansive. He can express amazement and curiosity. He is growing aware of the impersonal forces of nature. He can distinguish fundamental similarities and differences when comparing a baseball and an orange, an airplane and a kite, wood and glass. The origin and growth of plants from seeds begins to intrigue him. He takes a deepening interest in the life processes of animals. He is even beginning to believe that all men are mortal and that even he will one day die. But at this relatively positive age, this knowledge does not depress him as it might have done earlier.<br> &nbsp;<br> How Eight loves to talk! He comes home from school just &#x201c;bursting&#x201d; with news: &#x201c;You never saw anything like it!&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, it was awful!&#x201d; In fact, everything tends to be dramatized: &#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s the matter with me!&#x201d; &#x201c;This has got me crazy!&#x201d; &#x201c;I always get the easy ones wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Personal space is expanding for the Eight-year-old. He can now return home alone by bus from a somewhat distant point. His walking area within his own neighborhood is so wide that it is sometimes hard to locate him. He loves to take trips to new cities, visit museums, zoos, and other places of interest. Eight&#x2019;s spatial world is expanding even further through an interest in geography. He has a fairly clear notion of points of the compass and different parts of his community in relation to each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> The child at Seven tended to stick close to home. Eight explores new territory. He sees beyond the boundaries of his neighborhood. He likes to order from a mail-order catalog, loves to look things up in the encyclopedia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight is in general healthier and less fatiguable than he was at Seven, more fond of rough-and-tumble play and boisterous games. His tempo is rapid when he talks, reads, writes, or practices the piano. He wolfs down food, sitting on the edge of his chair, ready to bolt outdoors without pulling up his socks or tucking in his shirt. Eight-year-old boys may add a little bravado to their slap-dash demeanor to emphasize their masculine toughness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Seven-year-old was in many ways, with his anxieties and dark suspicions, still very much a child. Eight seems to be moving toward adulthood. He is definitely growing up; he even looks more mature than he did at Seven. Subtle changes in Eight&#x2019;s body now hint at the body he is going to have when he gets older. He is much better coordinated when it comes to sports.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relationships are extremely important at this age&#x2014;the child&#x2019;s relationships with Mother and Father, with friends. At Six the child was busy building up practical working relationships with others. Now the girl or boy is building up emotional and attitudinal relationships. How he feels about others and how they feel about him is important.<br> &nbsp;<br> The typical Eight-year-old tends to listen closely when adults talk among themselves. He watches their facial expressions; he hopes they may say something favorable about him, but he recognizes the gap between the world of the adult and his own world, and adjusts accordingly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight is curious about and interested in human relationships, particularly those of the adults close to him. In fact, he can be described as downright nosy. Girls explore family problems and relationships through the medium of paper dolls. Like chessmen on a chessboard, the paper dolls symbolize agents and situations. Father, mother, bride, bridegroom, daughter, son, baby, visitor&#x2014;all are represented by these dolls, which can be so freely manipulated with dramatic commentary. Sometimes the dialogue suggests more insight than the Eight-year-old can actually claim: &#x201c;My husband would not be unfaithful to me!&#x201d; said one dramatic Eight to her friend. &#x201c;He has been already,&#x201d; the friend replied smugly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight is increasingly aware of himself as a person, is interested in what makes him tick. As one mother of an Eight-year-old remarked, &#x201c;Even his gestures are like him.&#x201d; Now the child is conscious of his own appearance, his own personal qualities. He may be torn between the desire to grow up and the wish to remain as he is. And in his dramatic way he exaggerates his problems and dilemmas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight&#x2019;s performance is often only mediocre, and his notion of other people&#x2019;s standards is extremely high. This discrepancy leads to tears and temporary unhappiness, at times; or Eight may boast and alibi to make up for what he can do and what he would like to do. His feelings are easily hurt, and the child of this age tends to be extremely sensitive to criticism. He is quick to recognize his all-too-frequent failures and will groan: &#x201c;I never get anything right!&#x201d; &#x201c;I always do things wrong!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> While Eight is hard on himself, he is also hard on others. He can be quarrelsome and aggressive toward people, particularly Mother. To excuse his attacks on others, he often convinces himself that he himself is being attacked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight&#x2019;s sensitivity is also revealed in his need for praise for what he&#x2019;s done. &#x201c;This is crummy, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he may ask, hoping to be assured that it&#x2019;s great. He is, however, rather discriminating, so that the praise he seeks must be at least partially plausible.<br> &nbsp;<br> When things go very wrong for Eights, they do get truly angry. Some show their anger at least partly in jest. Thus they may tense up their faces in exasperation, project their lower jaws, and draw back and flex their arms at the elbow as they clench their fists. This dramatic pose is sure to produce laughter from other children at school.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight is becoming more responsible in regard to time. His increased speed in action makes him less vulnerable to the demands of time. He can now be expected to arrive at school at the proper hour. However, some Eights do not tell time as well as they did earlier; Eights are often careless with their watches and may lose, break, or misplace them. Though he may tell time less well, Eight is aware of punctuality. He keeps himself posted by asking others what time it is. If he knows he is going to arrive home late, he may even be responsible enough to telephone.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</h2><p>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna as translated by Swami Nikhilananda offers the reader a penetrating view into the spiritual wisdom of India. On account of his deep mystical experiences and constant absorption in God, Sri Ramakrishna (1836 - 1886) is regarded as being of the stature of Krishna, Buddha, and Christ. The Gospel is the record of Sri Ramakrishna's conversations, which are unique in their breadth and depth. Profound spiritual truths are described in simple words and vivid stories, revealing the divinity of man and the spiritual foundation of the universe. This volume is a mine of inspiration, wisdom, theology, and metaphysics. <p>This 1106 page volume contains an introduction (70 pages) by Swami Nikhilananda that narrates the main events of Sri Ramakrishna's life and briefly sketches the people and the doctrines associated with him. Also, includes 26 photographs, a detailed glossary, and an index.</p></p><p>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is published by The Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York which bases it teachings on the principles of Vedanta, or Hinduism. Hinduism teaches that every soul is potentially divine, and that its divinity may be manifested through worship, contemplation, unselfish work, and philosophical discrimination. According to Hinduism, Truth is universal and all humankind and all existence are one. It preaches the unity of the Godhead, or ultimate Reality, and accepts every faith as a valid means for its own followers to realize the Truth. For more information about the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York, visit www.ramakrishna.org.Swami Nikhilananda, a direct disciple of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, was born in a small Indian village in 1895 and was ordained a monk of the Ramakrishna Order in 1924. After spending several years in the Himalayan monastery of his Order, during which time he made a study of Hinduism and other systems of philosophy and religion, he was sent to America in 1931. He founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York in 1933 and was its spiritual leader until his passing away in 1973. <p>The Swami was a gifted writer, and his contributions to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda literature cannot be overstated. His translations of the scriptures, his biographies of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda, his compilations of the works of Swami Vivekananda, his other books and many articles in various journals and publications are permanent sources of spiritual knowledge and inspiration. Notable among these works are the following titles: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother, Vivekananda: A Biography, The Upanishads (volumes I-IV), The Bhagavad Gita, Self-Knowledge, Hinduism, and Man in Search of Immortality. Many of these works were originally introduced by major publishers, such as Harper &amp; Row (New York) and George Allen &amp; Unwin (London). Time Magazine called Swami Nikhilananda's translations of The Bhagavad Gita, "The first really readable, authoritative English translation of one of the world's greatest religious classics." W. Somerset Maugham praised Self-Knowledge as a "wonderful piece of exposition." </p><p>But the Swami's monumental work, for which he will ever be remembered, is The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. This complete translation into English from the original Bengali of the Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita, as recorded by "M," has made the immortal words of this great prophet of the nineteenth century available to countless readers throughout the world. Aldous Huxley was pleased to write a foreword to The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, and high praise was given to the book by such notable persons as Thomas Mann and Henry Miller. Time Magazine referred to The Gospel as "One of the world's most extraordinary religious documents."

P. T.

She published <i>Twenty-one Elephants and Still Standing</i>, a story about P. T. Barnum and the Brooklyn Bridge, with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.Starred Review. Grade 1-5&#x2013;This well-researched, handsomely illustrated picture book captures the anticipation and uncertainties of those who witnessed the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. Focusing on Phineas T. Barnum of circus fame, who saw in the doubt an opportunity, Prince describes the pachyderm procession up Broadway, past City Hall, and over the bridge to Brooklyn. As viewers' and readers' excitement mounts, the author queries, How many pounds can the wondrous bridge hold? How many elephants are too great a load? After the successful spectacle, skeptics crossed fearlessly, and where did they go? Why, they went to the Big Top, of course! While many picture books have been written about this famous construction, this one is by far the best read-aloud. The sparse, yet powerful text contains both alliteration and occasional rhyme, making it a pleasure for readers and listeners alike. Roca's masterful paintings capture both the spirit of the times and of the expansive bridge, extending beyond the confines of the page to cover almost half of the adjacent one. Not to be confused with Phil Bildner's <i>Twenty-One Elephants</i> (S &amp; S, 2004), which is wordier, more fictionalized, and visually less appealing, this title is ideal for units on local history and bridges.<i>&#x2013;Barbara Auerbach, New York City Public Schools</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Without a doubt, one of the most incredible stories you will ever read." -<i>The&nbsp;Roanoke Times</i></b><br><br><b>"Every once in a while, a true story comes along that reads like fiction... It grabs you on page one and never lets go." - Senator Carl Levin, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee</b><br><br>As the twentieth century closed, the veterans of its defining war passed away at a rate of a thousand per day. Fortunately, D-Day paratrooper Joseph Beyrle met author Thomas H. Taylor in time to record Behind Hitler's Lines, the true story of the first American paratrooper to land in Normandy and the only soldier to fight for both the United States and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany. It is a story of battle, followed by a succession of captures, escapes, recaptures, and re-escapes, then battle once more, in the final months of fighting on the Eastern Front. <br><br>For these unique experiences, both President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin honored Joe Beyrle on the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day. Beyrle did not strive to be a part of history, but history kept visiting him. Twice before the invasion he parachuted into Normandy, bearing gold for the French resistance. D Day resulted in his capture, and he was mistaken for a German line-crosser - a soldier who had, in fact, died in the attempt. Eventually Joe was held under guard at the American embassy in Moscow, suspected of being a Nazi assassin. Fingerprints saved him, confirming that he'd been wounded five times, and that he bore a safe-conduct pass written by marshal Zhukov after the Wehrmacht wrested Joe, at gunpoint, from execution by the Gestapo. In the ruins of Warsaw his life was saved again, this time by Polish nuns. Some of Joe's story is in his own words - a voice that will be among the last and best we hear firsthand from World War II.</p><p><b>Thomas H. Taylor</b>, a veteran of the 101st Airborne Division, was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars for valor, the Purple Heart, and five other decorations for his service in Vietnam. A graduate of St. Albans School and West Point, he left the army in 1968 to take a master&#x2019;s degree in sociology and a Juris Doctor from the University of California, where he won the Carothers Prize for literary composition; in the same year, he was designated a Bread Loaf Fellow at Middlebury College, Vermont. He lives in Washington, D.C.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>THE EUROPEAN THEATER OF OPERATIONS<br><br>in the summer of 1943 u-boats took a heavy toll of allied shipping, so the 101st Airborne Division would be in peril and out of their element while crossing the Atlantic, but at least the enlisted men now knew their destination: northern Europe, to open a second front against Nazi Germany. That basic mission had been concealed till they reached Camp Shanks, thirty miles upriver from New York City, the division&#x2019;s staging area for embarkation. They&#x2019;d had to remove the Screaming Eagle shoulder patch and wear regular GI shoes instead of the distinctive paratrooper jump boots, their pride and talisman. An officer tried to explain the reason: &#x201c;The Axis has to be kept guessing.&#x201d;<br><br>German spies were thought to have infested New York City, and it was a strategic secret that the 101st would be committed against Hitler rather than Hirohito. Initial betting had been otherwise. It had been the Japanese who attacked Pearl Harbor; Germany declared war on the United States four days later, the only time in World War II they bothered with such a formality.<br><br>The stay at Camp Shanks was only long enough for inoculations and inspections before it was time to go, time for &#x201c;the arsenal of democracy,&#x201d; as Churchill called America, to push another seven thousand soldiers across the sea to join the Allied counteroffensive that had already reconquered North Africa and knocked Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy out of the war. Feeling like lemmings, Screaming Eagles jammed onto Hudson River ferries, which converged on a pair of troopships at Manhattan&#x2019;s piers. At one was the great French liner the Normandie, gutted and blackened by fire. The name meant nothing to most paratroopers, for they&#x2019;d yet to learn where Normandy was.<br><br>Awaiting Joe Beyrle was the HMS Samaria, decrepit and sooty, hardly resembling the cruise ship she had been for the Cunard line. His squad, within an endless walking serpentine, shouldered ponderous duffel bags as they staggered up the gangplank, then descended to search for space below the waterline. They would sleep there in eight-hour, &#x201c;hot hammock&#x201d; shifts, as the number of soldiers embarking was more than twice the capacity of the ship. They were accustomed to the tubular constriction of an airplane, but the Samaria&#x2019;s massive gray perpendiculars were alien and intimidating. Soon they returned to deck, uncharacteristically subdued, some mumbling about the previous night&#x2019;s send-off by New York girls when they had been allowed a last pass to the city, but for most it was time to just lean on the rail, look down on dockside, take it all in, and think.<br><br>Joe thought mostly about the last year, how he had come so far from Muskegon, the pleasant town of his childhood on the east shore of Lake Michigan. From Kalamazoo&#x2019;s induction center the army had swept Joe away to Georgia, eventually to march him across the state like one of General Sherman&#x2019;s infantrymen. He was an infantryman, a bullet launcher, but also trained as a radio operator with a subspecialty in demolitions. He spent a few weeks in Panama, then moved on to North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky for large-scale maneuvers, then back to North Carolina again and finally to bleak Camp Shanks. There had been so much travel and training, so much of the school of the soldier, that homesickness had become a memory like an adolescent disease.<br><br>With straining hawsers, a cluster of small tugs gathered around the Samaria to tow her from the pier. On the waterfront men in suits stopped to watch a ritual that over the previous year had been so often repeated but was never routine, that of soldiers crammed afloat setting off to war, an army going to sea. Some civilians waved slowly with their hats, igniting a response on board. Under steam, the Samaria made way by the Statue of Liberty, passing a ferry whose deck began to undulate with waving passengers, a further sign that the USA was behind them in support, as it soon would be in distance.<br><br>With Sandy Hook still abeam, the troopers were issued life vests to be worn at all times except in hammocks. It was also time to go below; no cigarettes were allowed on deck as a total blackout went into effect while the ship&#x2019;s engines slowly thumped en route to join a convoy forming off Long Island. Dusk settled into a darkly rising mist as if America were receding into the past.<br><br>The past was the civilian world, what it had been for soldiers who were wrested from it, what it had made of them. In June 1942 Joe graduated from Saint Joseph High School with twelve other seniors, who voted him Best Informed, Most Obvious Temper, Class Shark, and Best Dressed. That last title may have been awarded by sarcasm because he owned but one threadbare suit and was color-blind, likely to wear mismatched socks unless his mother noticed. Fortunately she did before the graduation prom held at the Muskegon Women&#x2019;s Club, chaperoned by nuns. Music was on records, nothing but waltzes and two-steps&#x2014;jitterbugging was considered too controversial for a Catholic-school dance.<br><br>A shark meant an opportunist, and Joe was that. In the Depression, opportunity for him included sweeping out a barbershop for pocket change or fighting for choice discards from a grocery store. Such rummaging became his talent after &#x201c;standing in line with my brothers, for nine family members, waiting to receive surplus government handouts. At the age of twelve that hit me like a blacksmith&#x2019;s hammer.&#x201d;<br><br>From then on opportunity meant an escape from ignominy. That&#x2019;s what the army provided him more than anything else.<br><br>As smokers left the Samaria&#x2019;s decks there was enough room for Joe and his two best buddies, Jack Bray and Orv Vanderpool, to wedge together on the rail, their life vests pressing one another like adjoining cocoons. No doubt there was something Sergeant Duber wanted them to do, but he would have to find them in the darkness among unidentifiable pods of whispering troopers. Vanderpool, a laconic Californian, kept glancing over his shoulder, while Bray had to be muted lest Duber detect his Cajun accent. He was nostalgic, most immediately for last night in New York, secondly for his hometown of New Orleans. It seemed probable now that the 101st would be visiting France, where Bray looked forward to using his French connection.<br><br>Soon troopers from the &#x201c;first seating&#x201d;&#x2014;a euphemism from the Samaria&#x2019;s cruise-ship history&#x2014;surged on deck grumbling and still hungry after their first meal of fish that tasted like it had been pickled during World War I. What went with the fish smelled worse; the oily stench so pervaded the ship&#x2019;s interior that the first seating brought their blankets on deck. Advice for the second seating was break out your K rations, as those tasteless bricks would be the best food for the next couple of weeks.<br><br>The first week at sea was one of sullen nervousness, with officers seething against the inability to exercise, except for calisthenics, and train, except for target practice at crates thrown overboard. They saw their men as Olympic athletes at the peak of fitness, losing their edge during the listless transit to venue. Preparation for combat had emphasized how scattered they would be after their parachutes drifted apart; now the troopers were suffocatingly crammed together. There had been a cadence chant when they&#x2019;d run in formation back at Fort Bragg: &#x201c;GI beans and GI gravy. Gee, I wish I&#x2019;d joined the navy.&#x201d; No such envy anymore.<br><br>Nevertheless, the 101st was in the war now while not yet into it. U-boat alerts put the convoy into zigzagging maneuvers. Day and night, like overworked sheepdogs, destroyers wove between the lumbering transports. One of them developed engine trouble and turned back for Newfoundland with a regiment of paratroopers aboard. Watching ships change position was one of the few things for men to do, but the main relief from idleness was interminable gambling as the weather cooled over iron-gray seas that rocked so slightly that dice rolled true when bouncing off bulkheads. As constant as the thumping of the ship&#x2019;s engines was the clickety-clack of crapshooters wherever three or more could huddle.<br><br>They themselves were chips in the greatest gamble taken by the U.S. Army to date, that of creating airborne forces made up of paratroopers and glider riders. In 1940 General George C. Marshall had been stunned by the success of German paratroopers in capturing the island of Crete from a larger force of first-rate Commonwealth troops. German losses were so high that Hitler, hardly the type to count his dead, never again attempted a large-scale airborne operation. Nor did Stalin, for whom loss of life meant even less, though he produced more such units.<br><br>While the dictators saw only prospects of airborne disasters, Marshall would not let fear distract him from high hopes. During construction of the Pentagon he sent his planning staff a quote from prescient Benjamin Franklin: &#x201c;Where is the prince who could so afford to cover his country with troops for its defense as that 10,000 men descending from the clouds might not in many places do an infinite deal of mischief?&#x201d;<br><br>Marshall was a man of great humanity&#x2014;author of the postwar plan that saved Western Europe&#x2014;and the army&#x2019;s all-time greatest chief of staff. He was also godfather of the American Airborne, convinced like Franklin that &#x201c;vertical invasion,&#x201d; as the press would call it, offered too much potential to be rejected because of anticipated casualties. Marshall set the minds of two of his best and brightest generals, Omar Bradley and Matthew Ridgway, to the task of creating a satisfactory trade-off between losing soldiers and taking the enemy&#x2019;s from the rear.<br><br>The result was that in 1942 the 82nd (&#x201c;All-American&#x201d;) Infantry Division, with battle streamers from World War I, was split in half to form two small airborne divisions, the 82nd and the 101st (&#x201c;the Screaming Eagles&#x201d;). To bring the 101st up to strength, a glider regiment was attached, along with what was to be Joe&#x2019;s parachute regiment, the 506th, whose cadre gathered at Toccoa, a remote National Guard camp in the mountains of northeast Georgia.<br><br>When told he would be sent to Toccoa, Joe had asked, &#x201c;To what?&#x201d; It is a Cherokee word, as is Currahee, name of the mountain overlooking Toccoa. Currahee means &#x201c;stand alone.&#x201d; Till it was attached to the 101st, the 506th would indeed stand alone, so &#x201c;Currahee&#x201d; became their motto, shouted when they jumped from airplanes. The second parachute regiment to form at Toccoa, the 501st, coined the famous jump cry &#x201c;Geronimo.&#x201d;<br><br>At Camp Custer, Michigan, with twelve other recruits ordered to report to the 506th, Joe was the alphabetically ranking man and so was given a big official envelope addressed to the regimental commander, Colonel Robert F. Sink, their first and only wartime commander. He had a tabula rasa to create his outfit, to test organization and practices with minimal oversight, to help write the U.S. Airborne manual as he went along. Sink had plenty of officers to help. An initial expectation was that Airborne fatalities would be so high that each platoon was assigned two lieutenants, not just one as in the rest of the army.<br><br>Facing the draft that swept up every teenager in Muskegon, Joe volunteered for the Airborne, inspired by its recruiting poster of a tommy-gunner dangling from a parachute over the slogan jump into the fight! But he had to tell the recruiter of his disqualifying color blindness. The sergeant nodded, affirming that troopers jump when a light in the fuselage flashed from red to green. Had Joe ever gotten a traffic ticket for running a light? No? &#x201c;Then don&#x2019;t worry, Beyrle,&#x201d; he said, stamping &#x201c;Approved&#x201d; on Joe&#x2019;s application. &#x201c;A dozen guys will push you out when the light changes.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe and his cohort from Camp Custer were the last passengers at the last stop of a mile-long steam train, earlier full of GIs bound for other destinations, arriving at the Toccoa rail spur after three days of stops and switches. They were met by a sergeant from the 506th, who took Joe&#x2019;s envelope, then trucked the Currahee candidates up Georgia Highway 13.<br><br>He was unexpectedly friendly, pointing out a casket factory off the road and noting that the 506th&#x2019;s camp had originally been named for a Confederate general, Augustus Toombs. Caskets and a name homonymous with tombs were not good morale builders, so Sink had revived the name Toccoa. Besides, the sergeant said, Toombs had been just a so-so general and Sink didn&#x2019;t want anyone&#x2019;s name connected with the camp unless he was a great soldier. Whatever the symbolism of its name, Toccoa was in the hills of nowhere. There Joe was housed in tar-paper barracks that had been hastily constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p><h2>Life of Zarf: The Trouble with Weasels</h2><p><b>"A Wimpy Kid format with a fairy-tale twist?

Good old Cotswin&#x2014;Home of the Prancing Knights. (Trust me, no one is happy about that mascot name. Petitions have been filed.) </p><p>School is tough. In a lot of ways. Trolls aren&#x2019;t exactly known for their book smarts. I&#x2019;m doing my best to overcome my heritage, but it ain&#x2019;t easy. I was doing a word problem the other day in class and actually caught myself grunting. Grunting! So embarrassing. Fortunately it was kind of a quiet grunt. More like a gruntlet.</p><p>This is one of the reasons it&#x2019;s important to surround yourself with a quality crew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>� 3 �</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>SIX DEGREES OF KEVIN</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two weeks ago on a rainy Tuesday morning, my friend Kevin stopped by my house like he does every day on the way to school. His full name is Kevin Littlepig, of the world-famous Littlepigs. You&#x2019;ve probably heard of them. His family lives a few streets over in an epic mansion called Littlepig Manor. </p><p>After their well-known encounters with a certain huffing and puffing wolf, Kevin&#x2019;s dad and his uncles got into the construction business and made a small fortune. They&#x2019;re constantly pushing Kevin to become a structural engineer. Given their family history, I guess I can&#x2019;t blame them. </p><p>Kevin and I have been best friends since second grade, when I traded him a leg of my mom&#x2019;s mutton for an extra milk at lunch. My mom makes the best mutton this side of Notswin Castle. Ask anyone. Kevin couldn&#x2019;t stop going on about that mutton. He still talks about it&#x2014;like a broken record. This particular day I&#x2019;m gonna tell you about, he arrived looking pretty shaken up, but I still noticed him sniffing around the kitchen just in case. Seriously, he&#x2019;s like an un-dead mutton zombie or something. </p><p>Kevin has issues. Lots of &#x2019;em. For starters, there&#x2019;s his height. His last name, Littlepig, really couldn&#x2019;t be more appropriate. He stands about knee-high to a hill ferret, and boy is he ever sensitive about it. I once saw him burst into tears when he ordered pancakes and the waitress asked if he wanted a &#x201c;short stack.&#x201d;</p><p>He also might be the most nervous individual in the world. It can be kind of annoying, the way he&#x2019;s always worrying and wringing his hooves. If there were a Stress Olympics, he&#x2019;d take the gold all day long&#x2014;but then he&#x2019;d probably drop dead from a panic attack on the winners&#x2019; podium. </p><p>I swear to you, the other day on the way to school he admitted to me that he&#x2019;d been worrying that he wasn&#x2019;t worrying enough. That makes my head hurt to even think about. He&#x2019;s kind of a freak-show that way.</p><p>So Kevin showed up at my place and as we were walking through a steady drizzle to school, I could tell something was bothering him. When he&#x2019;s really worked up, he lets out these little whimpers and twitches a lot.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with you? You&#x2019;re like a fart in a skillet.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked up with wide eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what that means. Is that bad? That&#x2019;s bad, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it just means you&#x2019;re hopping around a lot. What&#x2019;s on your mind?&#x201d;</p><p>So as we cut across the Enchanted Field, Kevin nervously filled me in on the latest village news. A group of woodsmen from Wallen, the next village over from ours, had been attacked by a herd of Snuffweasels. Details were foggy about the woodsmen&#x2019;s injuries, but the town was understandably flipping out. There hadn&#x2019;t been a Snuffweasel sighting in ten years or more, and everyone was pretty happy about that. If you aren&#x2019;t familiar with them, Snuffweasels are nothing to sneeze at. They stand about seven feet tall with mouths full of teeth like broken glass. They&#x2019;re sort of like Swampweasels, but quite a bit snuffier. </p><p>&#x201c;I heard they ate one guy&#x2019;s face and toes.&#x201d; Kevin shuddered.</p><p>&#x201c;This is fantastic,&#x201d; I said in a hushed tone.</p><p>&#x201c;WHAT?? How can you say that??&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I quickly backpedaled. &#x201c;Not that people were hurt! That&#x2019;s horrible. Just the fact that there are Snufffweasels out there. I thought they were pretty much extinct.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s easy for you to say! You&#x2019;re not made of delicious bacon! I hear they have a real taste for pork products!&#x201d; </p><p>Kevin was really worked up now, so I just patted him on the back and kept my thoughts to myself as we arrived at school. </p><p></p><p></p><p>� 4 �</p><p>WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE </p><p>Cotswin Middle School is a damp old dungeon of a building, and on rainy days like today it reeks of dark mold and soggy Tater Tots. It probably bothers me more than most, as trolls can smell a mincemeat pie from three villages away. No joke. </p><p>The entryway was full of kids stamping around and shaking off the rain. I was bent over drying off my soggy feet when one of the football giants casually pushed my backpack up over my head, pitching me forward onto my nose with my shirt shoved up around my ears. </p><p>Of course, everyone got a huge kick out of me with a face full of muddy mat water, and laughter rang out in the wet foyer. Savages! Neanderthals! Anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Welcome to Cotswin.</p><p>Let me say a word about the social ladder at Cotswin. I&#x2019;ve taken the time to draw up a visual aid for you. </p><p>At the top, you&#x2019;ve got your princes and princesses. They&#x2019;re the true &#x201c;populars.&#x201d; Then come your knights and fair maidens. Just below that are the jocks, made up mostly of giants and ogres. Then come your wizards. They&#x2019;re kind of all science-y and geeky, but they can also do some pretty cool tricks.</p><p>Then comes the general population&#x2014;just your average kids: elves, gnomes, enchanted animals, etc. Below them are the minstrels, or band kids. A few kids are in rock minstrel bands, which elevates their status, but for the most part, this is where they settle in the social pecking order. Then, finally, on the bottom rung you have your trolls. The princesses and maidens aren&#x2019;t exactly lining up to go to the school dances with my size-22, two hairy left feet. I try not to take it personally. Trolls have had it crappy since time began. It&#x2019;s just the way it&#x2019;s always been. </p><p>When I arrived at my locker, Kevin&#x2019;s and my other good friend Chester was waiting for me with a big goofy grin. </p><p>A few words about Chester. First, I would say that he&#x2019;s my Second Best Friend. Technically, he&#x2019;s right up there with Kevin, but I&#x2019;ve known Kevin a couple years longer, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know. He gets the Number 2 slot and seems okay with that. But if they were in some sort of weird best friend race, it&#x2019;d be a photo finish.</p><p>Chester Flintwater is the son of the Notswin Court Jester. If you&#x2019;re not familiar with what a jester does, they&#x2019;re sort of like a clown whose job is to make the king laugh. They tell jokes, smash bottles over their head, fall down, shove breadsticks up their nose&#x2014;whatever it takes to get a smile out of the big guy. </p><p>It is assumed that when Chester&#x2019;s dad retires, Chester will take over the position of jester. And yes, this will make him &#x201c;Chester the Jester.&#x201d; This is the kind of rib-splitting hilarity one can expect when they have a clown for a father.</p><p>There is one problem, however. My friend Chester, God love him, is the least funny person I know. He tries. Oh, man does he try, but it&#x2019;s just not in him. He&#x2019;s constantly studying joke books, listening to old tapes of the <i>Classic Days of Ye Olde Comedy</i> show, and practicing his pratfalls. He actually keeps a rubber chicken on him at all times, no matter how many times I tell him they aren&#x2019;t funny. </p><p>I think he lives in a bit of a state of panic, knowing what&#x2019;s going to be expected of him. I&#x2019;m telling you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s painful to watch at times.</p><p>Chester saw me looking all disheveled and muddy, and tried to think up a witty quip.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow. Look at you. You look like a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited. It&#x2019;s best to let him try to work these things out.</p><p>&#x201c;Like a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You look like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; His eyes searched the ground, trying to find something even remotely funny. You could almost hear the gears grinding in his head.</p><p>Finally his shoulders sagged. &#x201c;Ah, I got nothin&#x2019;. But I was close.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting there. Just keep practicing.&#x201d; I gave him an encouraging smile as I popped open my locker.</p><p>Suddenly he brightened and pulled a wadded piece of paper out of his back pocket. &#x201c;Did you see this?&#x201d; He unfolded it and showed me a public notice&#x2014;one of the official ones from the castle. I took the sheet and read it quickly.</p><p>I looked up at Chester and we were able to hold it together for about 1.3 seconds before we both burst out laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;His valiant son Prince Roquefort?&#x201d; I snorted, which brought even louder laughter from Chester. I went on. &#x201c;Lord help us if our savior is Young Prince Cheeseball. Maybe the plan is to let a Snuffweasel chomp down on the little nimrod and then barf to death.&#x201d; I was on a roll. &#x201c;The day I put my safety in the Good Prince&#x2019;s hands is the day I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; And that, friends, was when I noticed that Chester was no longer laughing. That was when I heard a clearing of a throat and that oh, so annoying voice pipe up from behind and a bit below me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I do hope you&#x2019;re having a good laugh, Troll.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>� 5 �</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ROQUEFORT ON THE SIDE</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was, of course, Prince Roquefort. Flanked by two of his ogre bodyguards. Timing has never been my strong suit, but this was really bad.</p><p>Prince Roquefort is not a pleasant person. To be more accurate, I would rank him as one of the slimiest, sneakiest, most horrible people to ever slither through Cotswin Middle School. But I should let you judge his horribleness for yourself.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm. Maybe I should report you to my father.&#x201d; This was a classic Roquefort threat, but I could tell he was really steaming this time. &#x201c;Wait&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who&#x2019;s my father? Oh, that&#x2019;s right. He&#x2019;s the KING. As in, the man who could crush your stupid little troll family like so many floppy-eared bugs. So maybe you should watch your stupid troll mouth.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew these were empty threats. King Cheznott was considered a kind and fair king. A beloved king. Every troll in the kingdom had a warm place in their heart for him, as he&#x2019;d done more for troll rights than any king since King Cleo. His first act as a young king had been signing the Troll Act of &#x2019;57, outlawing Punch-A-Troll Day for good. </p><p>My parents and Gramps could go on forever about him. How he had sired a human skid mark like Roquefort was anyone&#x2019;s guess. But it wouldn&#x2019;t do any good to get even further on the bad side of the king&#x2019;s son. Besides, those ogre guards were not so subtly baring their teeth at me. I was seething, but I clenched my jaw and fists and kept my mouth shut.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your other friend, the pig? Maybe the three of you together would have the courage to stand up to me rather than carry on about me when you think I&#x2019;m not around.&#x201d; He had one of those gross stringy white spit things going between his lips when he spoke, and it somehow made me even angrier. </p><p>And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Prince Roquefort, the tiny tyrant of Cotswin, took things one step too far. He stood up on his toes and got as close to my face as he could. He spoke slowly and in a soft tone so that the crowd that had gathered had to lean in to catch every word.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what you and your friends are?&#x201d; His hot breath smelled like one of your stinkier cheeses. &#x201c;You know what you are to this school? I&#x2019;m going to tell you, because everyone else knows. You three are nothing but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>There was an audible gasp from the students gathered around. And then I saw red.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>� 6 �</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>YOU&#x2019;RE DRAGON ME DOWN</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are several types of dragons in our region. You&#x2019;ve got your Night Dragons, your Swamp Dragons&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then you&#x2019;ve got your really cool ones, like Lava Dragons. Lava Dragons are the ones everyone draws on their folders and has posters of in their bedrooms. </p><p>They&#x2019;re wicked-cool-looking, they shoot molten lava, and there are story after story about Lava Dragon battles in all of the coolest history books.</p><p>Then, you have your smaller, nuisance dragons. Your Plump Dragons, your Roof Dragons. These are more like big rats or birds than actual scary dragons. My dad has to put up plastic scaretrolls around our bridge to keep the Roof Dragons from pooping all over the house. </p><p>And then, unfortunately, there are Stink Dragons. A Stink Dragon is one of the foulest, smelliest creatures in all of the world. </p><p>One single Stink Dragon can bring down the property value of an entire village. They slither around leaving an awful sulfur-smelling trail of goo wherever they go. The village of Handel had an infestation of Stink Dragons two years ago and it just ruined them. They ended up burning the whole town down and starting over, just to get rid of that disgusting lingering fart smell. Nobody likes Stink Dragons. Period.

What equations should you use to decorate the Christmas tree? Will calculations show Santa is getting steadily thinner&#x2015;shimmying up and down chimneys for a whole night&#x2015;or fatter&#x2015;as he munches on cookies and milk in billions of houses across the world?In The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus, distinguished mathematicians Hannah Fry and Thomas Ol�ron Evans demonstrate, with eminently readable clarity, how applied mathematics are so thoroughly interwoven throughout our everyday lives by explaining mathematical concepts through one very merry motif: Christmas.In their quest to provide mathematical proof for the existence of Santa, the authors take readers on a festive journey through a traditional holiday season, wherein every activity, from wrapping presents to playing board games to cooking the perfect turkey, is painstakingly and hilariously analyzed. Because who hasn&#x2019;t always wondered how to set up a mathematically perfect Secret Santa?&nbsp; Lighthearted and diverting with Christmasy diagrams, sketches and graphs, equations, Markov chains, and matrices, The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus brightens up the bleak midwinter with stockingsful of mathematical marvels.</p><p><p><strong>Thomas Ol�ron Evans, PhD</strong> is a Teaching Fellow for the Smart Cities and Spatial Data Courses at the University College London.</p><p><strong>Hannah Fry, PhD</strong> is a broadcaster and lecturer of the Mathematics of Cities at the University College London.

As a "grammar," it teaches the fundamentals of poetry from scansion and rhyme to more advanced concepts like spatial poetry and synecdoche. Using the classical methodology of imitation (advocated by educators like Quintilian and Benjamin Franklin), this text makes students become active participants as they learn the craft of writing poems. It also offers practical tips and helps, including how to use a rhyming dictionary, how great writers use figures of speech effectively, and even when to break the rules of poetry. Its goal is to show students how to capably interact not just with poems, but with language in any situation.<p></p><p> Developed and used at Logos School with great success, the thirty lessons in Grammar of Poetry contain instruction on ten powerful tropes, student activities for every chapter, riddles to solve, a glossary of terms, a list of over 150 quality poems to integrate, and real-life examples from Shakespeare to traditional tongue twisters. It is designed for a semester at the 6-9th grade level, but is perfectly appropriate for anyone with basic writing skills and the desire to learn poetry.</p></p><p>Matt Whitling is the principal of Logos School and the author of the Imitation in Writing series. He is also a featured speaker at the Association of Classical Christian Schools&#39; Annual Conference and a member of the New Saint Andrews College Board.

He wrote his now-renowned book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> in 1936. This milestone cemented the rapid spread of his core values across the United States. During the 1950s, the foundations of Dale Carnegie Training� as it exists today began to take form. Dale Carnegie himself passed away soon after in 1955, leaving his legacy and set of core principles to be disseminated for decades to come. Today, the Dale Carnegie Training programs are available in more than&nbsp;30 languages throughout the entire United States and in more than 85 countries. &nbsp;Dale Carnegie includes as its clients 400 of the Fortune 500 companies. &nbsp;Approximately 7 million people have experienced Dale Carnegie Training.<b><i> Preface </i></b> <p> Dale Carnegie has done more than perhaps any other person to change the field of human relations and personal development. His world-famous program, <i>The Dale Carnegie Course</i>, has helped literally millions of people. </p><p> Looking back on his early years, Mr. Carnegie saw that worry and fear were the two forces that prevented him from achieving his own personal success. Conquering these two self-defeating emotions brought Mr. Carnegie a new perspective and new success. As a result, he made it his mission to help others overcome worry and fear so they could achieve their dreams. </p><p> Now, with this book, you too can benefit from the nine decades of insights into human relations that millions of people have discovered from Dale Carnegie Training. After experiencing <i>The 5 Essential People Skills: How to Assert Yourself, Listen to Others, and Resolve Conflicts</i>, you'll gain the ability to focus on the factors that will move you and your organization forward. You'll discover and be able to apply these proven practices, which will assist you in feeling empowered, respected, and at ease in any business or personal communication. They will improve your confidence while training you in the ways to get your message across with greater esteem, power, and clarity. </p><p> The primary achievement of this book is to identify and explore five essential people skills: <b>rapport building, curiosity, communication, ambition, conflict resolution</b>. But this is really just the beginning. As you'll see, a number of chapters extend and develop the five skills in new and exciting directions. So, as you move through these pages, be flexible in your thinking and proactive in applying the information you gain. Starting right now! </p><p> To achieve maximum benefits from this book, don't procrastinate. We suggest that you simply devote five minutes (or more) to begin reading. As you proceed through the book, be sure to complete the Action Steps section at the end of each chapter. These exercises are practical steps you can take immediately -- in your work or with your family and friends. </p><p> Whenever possible, give yourself a deadline, and hold yourself accountable for following through on that deadline. If you do not implement the action steps that you have mapped out for yourself, this book simply becomes an exercise in reading. While this is definitely effective, you will gain the full benefits that this valuable book has to offer you by working through the action steps. Make the life-changing choice to act upon your insights, ideas, and strategies, and you will achieve results that you never dreamed of. </p><p> Text edition copyright � 2009 by Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, Inc. </p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b><i>An Introduction to Assertiveness</i></b> </p><p> Just over seventy years ago, Dale Carnegie published a book that remains one of the most influential works of the past hundred years. What's more, it will probably be one of the most influential in the next century as well. That book is called <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>. The title could not be much clearer, could it? The ideas that it contains are every bit as clear, and as valid, today as they were in 1936, when the book first appeared. Although <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> is a monumental document in the history of personal development, it was a true groundbreaker when it first appeared. Before the publication of Dale Carnegie's book, the whole concept of people skills didn't really exist. Yet today we take it for granted that some approaches are better than others in human interactions. </p><p> Dale Carnegie's book put forth timeless human relations principles that remain essential today. In fact, their influence is greater than ever before. With the advance in technology and the speed of business, those who master interpersonal skills not only are a greater asset in today's workplace but achieve greater success. Computers and cell phones have made a big difference in our lives, but the importance of effective people skills has not diminished and it never will. </p><p> It really is impossible, however, to discuss a topic like people skills (especially in a business environment) without referring to the Internet, cell phones, and emails. These things are everywhere. Where you go, they go. The new technologies have certainly sped up the way things get done in the modern workplace, but they've also raised the expectations of how fast things need to get done. Today, people don't say they need something done tomorrow. They need it "yesterday." It's strange but true, and it's also something of a paradox. Work in many ways has become easier and faster, but work-related tensions are probably higher than ever before. Stress is everywhere and always -- and we all know that when tensions are high, the potential for friction between individuals rises proportionately. </p><p> This is the reality we're living in. There's no getting around it. This is the environment in which we must learn to succeed. And when I say "we," I mean "you," no matter who you are or what your career path might be. It doesn't really matter what area of the economy we are in, because the same forces are at play everywhere. So you'd better get on board. Dale Carnegie said it very well: "No matter what your line of work, even if it's in one of the technical professions, your degree of success depends on your ability to interact effectively with other people." Despite the fact that the technical professions are now the most potent sector of the American economy, those words still hold true. </p><p> <i>Exploration and Selection</i> </p><p> In the chapters that follow, we're going to be looking closely at exactly what's involved in assertive interactions. Our exploration will be quite selective. We've deliberately tried to make the subjects covered in this book very specific and sharply focused. The purpose here is not to say everything but to say a relatively small number of things very well. There are already fine books on the market dealing with conventional topics like effective listening or the keys to making a good sales presentation. But why cover ground that's been thoroughly explored? Instead, we're going to be looking at new areas, including five in particular: rapport building, curiosity, communication, ambition, and conflict resolution -- plus other topics that are natural extensions of these. </p><p> But there is one aspect of people skills that can never really receive enough attention, because it's the foundation of every kind of effective human interaction. </p><p> We're referring to assertiveness: the ability to speak and act in ways that naturally cause people to respond attentively and positively. It is the basic core element that is at the center of each of the five essential people skills. If you're not prepared to assert yourself in a positive and proactive manner, nothing else can possibly happen. So let's begin by looking at the real meaning of assertiveness in today's work environment -- where you really must make yourself stand out in order to get any attention at all. As this discussion goes on, we'll see how assertiveness differs from other, less effective forms of interaction. </p><p> There are a few things we can take for granted. Every human being, for example, has the desire to be treated fairly. We may not feel like fairness is happening, but at least fairness is something we want. What's more, when we feel we are not being treated fairly, we should insist on being treated fairly. We shouldn't just roll over on our backs and play dead, although that's more or less what many people do. To be treated fairly we must clearly, tactfully, and effectively express our preferences, needs, opinions, grievances, and other feelings. Nobody else should have to do this on our behalf. We have a responsibility to express our own needs. We also have a further responsibility to do so in an appropriate and productive way. If we don't do that, we are not only depriving ourselves of what we deserve, we are also depriving the people around us of the real contributions we have to make. </p><p> <i>Putting Our Rights and Responsibilities into Action</i> </p><p> Establishing reasonable parameters for being treated fairly is what assertiveness really means. These are like traffic laws: Getting where you want to go is important, but that doesn't mean you can run all the red lights. Assertiveness is the middle ground between the two extremes of reckless aggressiveness and defeatist passivity. The genuinely assertive person is neither one of these. Aggressive people are self-centered, inconsiderate, hostile, and arrogantly demanding. They drive people away. Passive people are weak, compliant, and disrespectful of his or her own best interests. They also drive others away -- except perhaps for aggressive people! Between these two poles, however, are people who know how to make their ideas known without preventing others from doing likewise. Your task is to become one of those people. Men and women who can do that are assertive people, and the purpose of this book is to show you how to become one of them. Once you master this skill, you will be doing what's best for yourself and for everyone around you. </p><p> That's the broad overview. When we begin to look more closely at assertiveness, however, the picture becomes more complex and even paradoxical. It's much easier to see what assertive <i>isn't</i> than what it <i>is</i>. While it's easy to characterize people who are blatantly aggressive or extremely passive, it's not always simple to express exactly what constitutes assertive behavior. This isn't really an unusual situation when talking about people's behavior. Like many other important human qualities, assertiveness is easier to recognize than it is to define. So let's look at the evidence. We'll begin by looking at some real-life situations in which the quality of assertiveness can come into play. </p><p> <i>A Real-Life Example of Effective Assertiveness</i> </p><p> Imagine that you've just completed an important project at work that consumed several weeks of your time.

There, she discovered courage as she faced off against a bull she couldn't see, and found in herself an abiding strength as she absorbed her parents' harrowing experiences during Eritrea's thirty-year war with Ethiopia. Their refugee story inspired her to embark on a quest for knowledge, traveling the world in search of the secret to belonging. She explored numerous fascinating places, including Mali, where she helped build a school under the scorching Saharan sun. Her many adventures over the years range from the hair-raising to the hilarious.<br><br> Haben defines disability as an opportunity for innovation. She learned non-visual techniques for everything from dancing salsa to handling an electric saw. She developed a text-to-braille communication system that created an exciting new way to connect with people. Haben pioneered her way through obstacles, graduated from Harvard Law, and now uses her talents to advocate for people with disabilities.<br><br> HABEN takes readers through a thrilling game of blind hide-and-seek in Louisiana, a treacherous climb up an iceberg in Alaska, and a magical moment with President Obama at The White House. Warm, funny, thoughtful, and uplifting, this captivating memoir is a testament to one woman's determination to find the keys to connection.</p><p><b>Haben Girma</b> advocates for equal opportunities for people with disabilities. President Obama named her a White House Champion of Change. She received the Helen Keller Achievement Award, and a spot on the <i>Forbes</i> 30 Under 30 list.

Her work has been featured in the <i>Financial Times</i>, BBC, <i>Washington Post</i>, NPR, and more."A stirring memoir of love and resilience. Haben proves there are no limits for living joyously in the world. A fierce, glorious advocate for equal opportunity, she demonstrates that accessibility for all benefits all.

Because she knows that achievement only happens when there is more than the support of individual extraordinary people, she pushes institutions and leaders in the academy, the government, and in big tech to widen the corridors of power and opportunity. Her intersectional approach to her work as an advocate for the disabled and as a Deafblind daughter of refugees refuses tokenization and demands true inclusion."&#x2015;<b><i> dream hampton, award-winning filmmaker, writer, and organizer</i></b><br><br>"With wit and passion, Haben, a disability rights lawyer, public speaker, and the first Deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law, takes readers through her often unaccommodating world...This is a heartwarming memoir of a woman who champions access and dignity for all."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i> (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"This autobiography by a millennial Helen Keller teems with grace and grit."&#x2015;<b><i><i>O Magazine</i></i></b><br><br>"Warmhearted and optimistic, [HABEN] celebrates personal courage and triumph as well as the unlimited potential of those whose real disability is living in a society that too often does not make accommodations for their physical impairments.

Nicknamed "Zippy" for the way she would bolt around the house, this small girl was possessed of big eyes and even bigger ears. In this witty and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period&#x2013;people helped their neighbors, went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards. <br><br> Laced with fine storytelling, sharp wit, dead-on observations, and moments of sheer joy, Haven Kimmel's straight-shooting portrait of her childhood gives us a heroine who is wonderfully sweet and sly as she navigates the quirky adult world that surrounds Zippy.</p><p><b>From Publishers Weekly</b> <p> It's a cliche to say that a good memoir reads like a well-crafted work of fiction, but Kimmel's smooth, impeccably humorous prose evokes her childhood as vividly as any novel. Born in 1965, she grew up in Mooreland, Ind., a place that by some "mysterious and powerful mathematical principle" perpetually retains a population of 300, a place where there's no point learning the street names because it's just as easy to say, "We live at the four-way stop sign." Hers is less a formal autobiography than a collection of vignettes comprising the things a small child would remember: sick birds, a new bike, reading comics at the drugstore, the mean old lady down the street. The truths of childhood are rendered in lush yet simple prose; here's Zippy describing a friend who hates wearing girls' clothes: "Julie in a dress was like the rest of us in quicksand." Over and over, we encounter pearls of third-grade wisdom revealed in a child's assured voice: "There are a finite number of times one can safely climb the same tree in a single day"; or, regarding Jesus, "Everyone around me was flat-out in love with him, and who wouldn't be? He was good with animals, he loved his mother, and he wasn't afraid of blind people." (Mar.)Forecast: Dreamy and comforting, spiced with flashes of wit, this book seems a natural for readers of the Oprah school of women's fiction (e.g., Elizabeth Berg, Janet Fitch). The startling baby photograph on the cover should catch browsers' eyes. </p><p> <i>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</i> </p><p> <b>From Booklist</b> </p><p> The title is awful, but Kimmel's childhood memoir rings true. Mooreland had a population of about 300, small enough for a grade-school girl to explore every corner and have strong opinions about the town's adults. More important, however, than the mean old lady across the street and the loud old man at the drugstore were Kimmel's family (parents, older brother and sister, and various pets) and the "best friends" with whom she experienced her small world. Kimmel remembers vividly what it felt like to be a kid: the pleasure of being outdoors; the unquestioned bonds of a "best" friendship; and the oddness of many of the things adults (and teenagers) do. Even in the 1960s and 1970s (Kimmel was born in 1965), Mooreland escaped the larger society's disruptions. An empty store was a Ku Klux Klan headquarters in the 1920s, but there were no African Americans around town; a pair of hippies moved in and offered Zippy a chance to give her dad a valued present. </p><p> <i>Mary Carroll Copyright American Library Association. All rights reserved </i> </p><p> <b>From Library Journal</b></p><p> In this first book, Kimmel has written a love letter to her hometown of Mooreland, IN, a town with an unchanging population of 300 in America's heartland. Nicknamed "Zippy" for her energetic interpretation of a circus monkey, she could not be bothered to speak until she was three years old, and her first words involved bargaining with her father about whether or not a baby bottle was still appropriate. Born in 1965, Zippy lived in a world filled with a loving family, peculiar neighbors, and multitudes of animals, including a chicken she loved and treated like a baby. Her story is filled with good humor, fine storytelling, and acute observations of small town life.

Traylor was born into slavery on an Alabama plantation, and his experiences spanned multiple worlds&#x2015;black and white, rural and urban, old and new&#x2015;as well as the crucibles that indelibly shaped America&#x2015;the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the Great Migration. <i>Between Worlds </i>presents an unparalleled look at the work of this enigmatic and dazzling artist, who blended common imagery with arcane symbolism, narration with abstraction, and personal vision with the beliefs and folkways of his time.</p><p>Traylor was about twelve when the Civil War ended. After six more decades of farm labor, he moved, aging and alone, into segregated Montgomery. In the last years of his life, he drew and painted works depicting plantation memories and the rising world of African American culture. Upon his death he left behind over a thousand pieces of art. <i>Between Worlds </i>convenes 205 of his most powerful creations, including a number that have been previously unpublished. This beautiful and carefully researched book assesses Traylor&#x2019;s biography and stylistic development, and for the first time interprets his scenes as ongoing narratives, conveying enduring, interrelated themes.</p><p><i>Between Worlds</i> reveals one man&#x2019;s visual record of African American life as a window into the overarching story of his nation.</p><p>Published in association with the Smithsonian American Art Museum</p></p><p><b>Leslie Umberger</b> is curator of folk and self-taught art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. <b>Stephanie Stebich</b> is the Margaret and Terry Stent Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. <b>Kerry James Marshall</b> is an internationally renowned artist and 1997 MacArthur Fellow."[A] remarkable catalogue, which exhaustively lays out what can be known of Traylor&#x2019;s life, in its historical context, and of the references in his art."<b>---Peter Schjeldahl, <i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"[Leslie] Umberger emerges as the finest interpreter of Traylor&#x2019;s life and career, proving that she is an American curator and art historian of the first order. . . .

In her much-praised film Orgasmic Birth, acclaimed filmmaker Debra Pascali-Bonaro showed that in fact childbirth is a natural process to be enjoyed and cherished. Now she joins forces with renowned author and activist Elizabeth Davis to offer an enlightening program to help women attain the most empowering and satisfying birth experience possible. While an orgasmic birth can, for some, induce feelings of intense, ecstatic pleasure, it is ultimately about taking control of one's own body and making the most informed decisions to have a safe, memorable, and joyful birth day.<br><br>Whether women choose to give birth at home, in a hospital, or in a birthing center, Orgasmic Birth provides all the necessary tools and guidance to design the birth plan that's best for them. Featuring inspiring stories from mothers and their partners and filled with practical advice and solutions, this one-of-a-kind resource is the next frontier of natural, intimate childbirth.</p><p>ELIZABETH DAVIS has been a midwife, women's healthcare specialist, and educator for more than 30 years.

It is more than lovemaking because it is about being stimulated by and loving the passion of life itself. It is a gift to humankind to discover divine pleasure in birthing.<br><br>--Marina A., Summerland Key, Florida<br><br>Welcome to Orgasmic Birth! Perhaps this topic appeals to you because you have already had an orgasmic birth and want to learn about others with similar experiences. Or perhaps you gave birth with difficulty and are either seeking healing or are hoping for something better next time. For those of you who have not yet had a baby, the concept of orgasmic birth may seem both intriguing and a bit outlandish. After all, most of us have heard stories from our mothers, sisters, and friends portraying birth as a painful, even agonizing event to be suffered through at best.<br><br>Rest assured: Orgasmic birth is very real, with a sound basis in physiology. But our culture has veered away from understanding and supporting the physiology of birth that quite naturally leads to ecstasy.<br><br>To understand how this has happened, we need only look at the core values that characterize modern society. Few of us would say that we live through our bodies; rather, we tend to push our bodies to work long hours or perform strenuous workouts, and then, when we find ourselves exhausted but unable to rest, we self-medicate with sleep aids, alcohol, etc. Our lives are thoroughly and often rigorously planned: Booked with obligations, we have little time for deep relaxation or spontaneous self-expression. If this results in physical pain, stress, or illness, there are plenty of pharmaceuticals to let us get on with our work or back to the workout.<br><br>The practice of listening to body wisdom as a guide to good health and fruitful living that characterized agrarian societies fell by the wayside as the pace of our lives accelerated with industrialization. Now, we seem to be entering a new era--one where more of us will work from home and set our own schedules, opening the possibility of living a more balanced lifestyle. But how well will we take advantage of this opportunity? When I am hard at work writing and notice that I am getting stressed, holding my breath, tightening my hips, or tensing my shoulders, I could go out to the garden and breathe, engage my senses, and be refreshed. But the habit of pushing myself is so ingrained that I often choose to ignore my body messages or, at best, promise myself I'll relax later, "when I have time."<br><br>The first time I gave birth, I was fresh from 2 years in Mexico, where I learned that if you are going somewhere, getting there is just as important as being there. Preparations for leaving, climbing into the car, being on the road--all of these were events of intrinsic worth, to be lived, played with, enjoyed. Nobody rushed as I had been raised to rush, tense up when things weren't moving fast enough, lose my temper if those around me moved too slowly, "get there on time" even if I was miserable trying to do it. And the amazing thing was that whenever we arrived always seemed to be the perfect time. Time and again I saw that my worries were a useless waste of energy. I wish I'd known this Mexican lesson was my best preparation for giving birth.<br><br>--Robbie Davis-Floyd, Austin, Texas,from Knowing: A Story of Two Births<br><br> If I have trouble listening to my body, imagine how difficult it is for someone without the time or means to do so. And yet, ecstatic pregnancy and birth experiences go a long way toward resolving this disconnect, literally bringing us back to our senses.<br><br>Another factor in our dissociation from our bodies is "hurry-up parenting." We want to be patient with our children, we really do, but we inadvertently pass our stress along to them, telling them to hurry up and get their shoes on, pick a toy, or finish their vegetables. Perhaps the most potent way that body wisdom has been preserved through the ages is through child- friendly mothering or grandmothering, in which we slow down and follow the child's pace--one that is nonlinear and fantastically creative precisely because the child has no obligation but to be in the moment. As more of us have chosen or been forced to work long hours and care for children in our spare time, we no longer receive our daily lessons from them--reminders on how to be creative, intuitive, and, ultimately, healthier and happier.<br><br>Modern culture is based on productivity; we are what we do. Mothering has consistently lost stature as income and social status have become the primary means for assessing success. But again, positive birth experiences can turn this around.<br><br>There are deeper layers to be explored here. For example, religious traditions that consider the body to be a danger zone just waiting to lead us astray can cause trouble with the birth process. When we separate body and mind (or consider the mind superior), we are hardly likely to listen to what the body has to tell us! Place childbirth in this context, and we can begin to see why women have disavowed natural birth for the seeming convenience of the hospital and pain relief, breastfeeding for the bottle, and so on.<br><br>It is a myth that giving birth has to involve pain. The idea that God cursed women with pain in childbirth is slander--it is a calumny against God. Presuming that God hates women and so cursed them to suffer because Eve bit the apple offered by the serpent is nonsense (and I say this as a committed Christian).<br><br>--Maria A., Berkeley, California<br><br>Whatever we may wish to believe, changes to personality that occur during pregnancy are incontrovertible precisely because they are born of the body. For example, there is the disruption of linear thinking due to hormones that begins in the first few months and carries well into breastfeeding. (I watched my newly pregnant aerobics instructor struggle with this over the last few days--ordinarily right on the mark, she forgot more than a few familiar routines!) I believe the reason our hormones slow us down and make us forgetful during pregnancy is to encourage the cultivation of "mother- mind," a highly intuitive and relaxed way of thinking and being. Mother- mind tunes us in to the body so we may be in optimal health when labor begins, ready to surrender to the challenges of giving birth and the tasks of caring for a newborn without lasting stress or fear.<br><br>Specifically, preparation for letting go rests in the hormones estrogen, progesterone, relaxin, and oxytocin. In order to understand birth, we must first appreciate the basic role each of these plays during pregnancy.<br><br>Estrogen is the hormone of ovulation, prompting the sweet and passionate sexual drives many women notice midcycle. In pregnancy, increased levels of estrogen accomplish wonderful things, not the least of which is heightened sensitivity and flexibility in the vagina, along with increased sensitivity of the breasts. Estrogen promotes growth, while progesterone promotes maintenance--particularly of the uterine lining, which helps keep the pregnancy secure.<br><br>Progesterone also teams up with relaxin to soften the body, causing greater flexibility in the joints and tendons, as well as in the blood vessels. Dilation of the vessels allows for a 50 percent increase in blood volume, which serves the baby's needs for nourishment and elimination and the mother's need for a cushion to mediate blood loss immediately after birth. Although vasodilation offers the additional benefits of reduced blood pressure and slower digestion (to increase absorption of nutrients), it can also cause varicose veins, hemorrhoids, heartburn, and dizziness upon rising suddenly. These effects could easily be interpreted as signs of weakness, were it not for the brilliant design underpinning them--one that promotes fetal growth and maternal well-being.<br><br>Over the years, I have done a good bit of research into the nature and cultivation of intuition, particularly as applied to women and birth, and have found it a fascinating and rich area of exploration. Intuition can be defined as knowing directly, characterized by perceptions that are clean and unexpected in their arrival. In contrast to fears or projections, intuition is seldom engendered while in a frazzled or agitated state but comes through best when we are relaxed and receptive. It has been shown that intuition correlates to brain wave frequency: In beta (stressor anxietybased thinking), our brain waves are rapid and jagged, whereas in alpha (a state of mind induced by meditation or rhythmic activities), our brain waves slow down, becoming higher in amplitude and more synchronous with those around us--we literally tune in to the bigger picture.<br><br>I was a terrible control freak during my first pregnancy, and I have no doubt that had an impact on my labor. Being a mother has mostly cured that tendency, and I believe that the long process of letting go of tight control over everything (which is really an illusion anyway) prepared me emotionally for my last birth like nothing else could have. I was much more able to just let labor have me than I was the first time, and I believe that's why this labor was so much shorter.<br><br>--Laura F., Powder Springs, Georgia<br><br> My spiritual awareness changed during pregnancy. I suddenly knew things I did not know before. My dreams were clear lessons. I think my baby's soul prepared me through dreams and meditations.<br><br>--Saskia S., Oak Grove, Kentucky<br><br>Why should pregnancy prompt the development of intuition? One reason is that intuition helps us to perceive and respond to our babies' needs before they can verbalize them. Knowing directly is undeniably time-saving, and time is at a premium when caring for a newborn. Intuition also supports mothers in self-care during the demanding years of growing a family. In fact, here is where the cultural formula of "do more, be more successful" begins to unravel: With intuition in the equation, doing less actually leads to being and knowing more.<br><br>Oxytocin is yet another element in the hormonal mix. Produced by the pituitary gland, it is otherwise known as the love hormone because it is released not only with sexual activity but also with arousal (even at the mere thought of a lover). This vital hormone is never at higher levels in a woman's life than when she is pregnant, reaching a peak at the moment she gives birth. In fact, oxytocin is the key to both heightened desire in pregnancy and orgasmic birth!<br><br>Oxytocin is also known as the bonding hormone, making it an important consideration not only in terms of who attends us when we give birth but also as regards our need for uninterrupted time with our newborn.<br><br>Returning to our discussion of intuition, there is a critical link between oxytocin and brain waves that are even deeper and more synchronous than alpha. When not altered by Pitcin or other interventions, the brain waves of laboring women are in theta frequency. This is the deepest level we can experience in a waking state. (We move into delta with sleep.) Theta is associated with extrasensory perception, creative inspiration, and spontaneous problem solving. In theta, time becomes relative and elastic. Anyone who has given birth (or attended a birth) can attest to points in the process when minutes seemed like hours and vice versa. Notice the correlation to the way our perception of time shifts with passionate lovemaking.<br><br>More than that, oxytocin facilitates bonding through entrainment. In this physiological process, the heartbeats and breathing rhythms of lovers become synchronized, and intimate partners in birth show synchronized brain wave frequencies. The slower the brain wave, the greater the potential for entrainment. Thus a woman laboring in theta can entrain attendants to her frequency, as long as they are loving, open, and unafraid.<br><br>On the other hand, what happens when there is fear in the mother or her attendants during labor? Quite literally, the doors to ecstasy close and pain increases. This is due to the release of catecholamines, or stress hormones, the most common of which is adrenaline. Adrenaline contracts the circular muscles of the uterus--including the cervical opening, which must be relaxed to dilate. This constriction results in pain and impaired circulation, often causing fetal distress.<br><br>I connected with my baby throughout my pregnancy. I searched for her and felt she was responding. In some strange way, not talking to her exactly, I was in communication. This gave me confidence that she was strong and everything would be fine.<br><br>After this birth, I am much more confident with other tasks in life. I know I have strong will and amazing intuition. I feel more connected to this baby than to either of the other two born in the hospital. I understand her without her saying anything, and I want to be close to her as much as possible.<br><br>--Michael R., Norwich, Connecticut<br><br>In contrast, oxytocin contracts the long uterine fibers attached to the cervix--which, if relaxed, opens easily. The long fibers also retract to form a thickened mass at the top (or fundus) of the uterus. It is this thickened muscle mass that pushes the baby out.<br><br>Thus the key to a spontaneous, ecstatic labor is simply to avoid whatever interferes with oxytocin production. Although adrenaline is the primary culprit, fear is not the only trigger: Stress, worry, or anything that causes beta brain waves will stimulate the release of adrenaline. If we feel our safety is in question or that we are being watched, we move into beta. As mentioned earlier, virtually all mammals slow or stop labor if observed. In hospital births, women are observed not only by medical personnel but also by technology (fetal monitoring, frequent internal exams, etc.). Even a mother's observations of her own behavior ("Am I doing it right?") dramatically reduce oxytocin release. Again, note the parallel to sexual activity: To whatever extent we are self-conscious or worried about our performance, the potential for (and magnitude of ) orgasm decreases exponentially. In fact, anything that stimulates the neocortex (such as exposure to bright light, people asking questions or conversing within earshot, or any sensory stimulation requiring linear thought) interferes with oxytocin production. In birthing, as in making love, privacy is crucial.<br><br>We held one another in our candlelit lounge and swayed back and forth. Our hips danced together. My face buried into his body during the rushes, and when they subsided we embraced, foreheads touching . . . the only two in the world.<br><br>Earlier, when I wanted to rest, lying down was painful unless he lay by my side. Whenever he touched me, my discomfort eased. He was better than any heat pack.<br><br>The line between pleasure and pain is very fine indeed. I sang my birth song, a low moan, and he sang with me. I was surprised by how much birth sounded like sex! But birth is part of the lovemaking continuum.</p><h2>The Forgetting Moon (1) (The Five Warrior Angels)</h2><p>A massive army on the brink of conquest looms large in a world where prophecies are lies, magic is believed in but never seen, and hope is where you least expect to find it.<br><br>Welcome to the Five Isles, where war has come in the name of the invading army of S�r Sevier, a merciless host driven by the prophetic fervor of the Angel Prince, Aeros, toward the last unconquered kingdom of Gul Kana.

Leastways, that was what Shawcroft was fond of saying. Nail fancied himself a good artist.

He also thought he was good with a sword.<br> <br>In fact, despite the pounding rain, things were going well. Nail ducked and raised his blade to parry. Steel cracked against steel. His hand stung with the impact. It felt good. He swung again, his momentum pushing him forward. He slipped, drawing Dokie Liddle&#x2019;s sword harmlessly over his head. With a clatter, Nail fell to his knees, wooden shield plowing into the mud, sword skittering off with a twang.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bloody Mother,&#x201d; he cursed, helmet cocked sideways, obscuring his vision.

Nail was the strongest seventeen-year-old in Gallows Haven. He wasn&#x2019;t easily beaten. He imagined the grin now spreading over Dokie&#x2019;s face under the helm. Stefan Wayland, Zane Neville, even Zane&#x2019;s brute of a shepherd dog, Beer Mug, watched, all waiting to see him stand and thrash Dokie good. Jenko Bruk was nearest, a look of pure amusement on his face. The Gallows Haven banner hung lifeless, sopping with rain, from the pole cradled in Jenko&#x2019;s arm. The other forty young men gathered on the practice field held similar looks. A grin spread over the gruff, bearded countenance of their trainer, Baron Jubal Bruk.<br> <br>Frustrated, Nail sat back on his heels. Too much daydreaming about Ava Shay. Tossing his gauntlets aside, he dug grime from under his armor with determined fingers and said, &#x201c;A lucky twist of fate for you, Dokie. &#x2019;Tis only this mud that&#x2019;s bested me.&#x201d; He shoved his gauntlets back on and tried to stand, feet slipping out from under him again. &#x201c;Rotted angels,&#x201d; he cursed.<br> <br>The air stirred as a chill wind stung Nail&#x2019;s face. The breath was sucked from his lungs. Lightning! His mind screamed in warning as a blinding flash flamed off Dokie&#x2019;s armor. The boy was flung away with a crack of thunder, sliding on his back.<br> <br>Nail hugged the ground. The air was caustic, his lungs raw, mouth parched. White mist clung about his vision. A shower of sparks spiraled down around him, dissolving in the rain-splattered grass. The back of his sword hand sang with pain.<br> <br>There were muffled voices, as if he was hearing them from under water. Jenko Bruk and Stefan Wayland were standing over him. &#x201c;Lucky bastard,&#x201d; Jenko muttered, dark amber eyes shifting between Nail and the others. Zane&#x2019;s shepherd dog was barking up a riot. Stefan held forth a hand. Nail took it, stood on wobbly legs. He spotted Dokie sprawled in the mud, arms and legs splayed out, blank eyes staring up at the rain. Dokie&#x2019;s body had left a path where it had slid through the muck. His helmet was gone and smoke drifted from the soles of his leather boots. Hoarse breaths swelled from his chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still alive!&#x201d; Baron Jubal Bruk bellowed as he made the three-fingered sign of the Laijon Cross over his breast and looked toward the sky. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get him into town.&#x201d; Baron Bruk and his son, Jenko, along with a few others, snatched up Dokie&#x2019;s limp form into their arms and headed for town.<br> <br>The rest of the sodden troop, clacking and clattering in their armor, quickly gathered their belongings and followed the baron south toward Gallows Haven.<br> <br>Nail struggled behind the rest, slogging through the muck, still in a daze. He looked skyward, eyes trying to focus as rain peppered his face. The back side of his sword hand still burned under his gauntlet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your satchel.&#x201d; Stefan came up behind him, draping the bag&#x2019;s leather strap over Nail&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;You almost forgot it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, thanks.&#x201d; The words felt strange on Nail&#x2019;s dry tongue. He swallowed hard, still trying to regain his bearings. His satchel held his most prized possessions: prayer book, art supplies, collection of charcoal drawings.<br> <br>Claps of thunder boomed behind Nail and Stefan as they hustled their pace to keep up with the others. Patches of trees added some shelter from the rain, but the road mainly bore them through fields and farmland. Hedges, wattle-and-daub fences, and rows of stone lined their path. The hollow clanking of goat bells sounded in the distance.<br> <br>On occasion, Zane&#x2019;s dog would bark into the gathering darkness of early evening, as if something were out there following them. Through the fog that still covered his brain, Nail&#x2019;s imagination began spinning with unholy images, images that had plagued his dreams since childhood. The fiery forms of the nameless beasts of the underworld. Red-eyed beasts that seemed to haunt the minds of lonely children, those children born fatherless, motherless, and alone. Nail knew he was different. He was a bastard and unnatural.<br> <br>When they tottered by a candlelit cottage, a whiff of woodsmoke swirled past Nail&#x2019;s nose, the aroma clearing his mind of churning thoughts.<br> <br>Soon the small company of trainees broke through a stand of evergreens and Gallows Haven was a sprinkling of lights before them. To the right of their path, on a low, sloping hill overlooking Gallows Bay, was the empty husk of Gallows Keep. It had not seen use in centuries. Now its leaning crenellated battlements rose over the village, nothing more than the ancient, broken-down remnants of a castle that was once whole.<br> <br>To their left was the village chapel. Nail felt sudden reassurance in its bulky gray presence. Despite what negative things Shawcroft said about the Church of Laijon and its teachings, Nail felt there was safety held within the chapel&#x2019;s great arches, in the thickness of its walls and its stoic grandeur. Above the door, three large stained-glass windows inlaid with intricate designs threw colorful shadows across their path. As those bearing Dokie&#x2019;s lightning-struck form passed through the front doors of the chapel, Nail looked up at those splendorous windows. On brighter days, with tattered sketchbook in hand, he would sit outside under them and sketch. In the center window was an image of Laijon, five colorful angel stones hanging above him like halos: white, red, black, green, and blue. Laijon wore a coat of shimmering chain mail and hefted a silver battle-ax named Forgetting Moon. In the left window floated two white-robed angels, one wielding a broadsword, Afflicted Fire, the other a black-wood crossbow, Blackest Heart. In the right window were two more heavenly apparitions, one with a horned war helm, Lonesome Crown, and the other carrying a mythical shield, Ethic Shroud. These were the five ancient weapons of lore.<br> <br>Once Jubal and Jenko Bruk and the others were inside the chapel, those five angelic images cast ghostlike reflections of white, red, black, green, and blue over them as they laid Dokie on the floor before Bishop Tolbret. The bishop was a plain-faced man, short and balding. He wore the dull brown cassock and black sash of his station with sacred white robes underneath.<br> <br>In the vaulted apse behind the bishop was a statue of Laijon cut from rough-hewn stone, the muscular carving thrice the size of a normal man, naught but a loincloth about his waist and a wreath of white heather atop his head. Laijon bore a flawless face but for the faint red line representing the fatal wound in his neck. He hung upon an even larger black-painted wooden replica of the Atonement Tree; its twining branches soared, almost reaching the ceiling of the chapel, filling the entire space of the apse.<br> <br>When Bishop Tolbret saw Nail, muddy and disheveled, he shot him an unfriendly look. Nail dropped his gaze and peeled off his gauntlets. His right hand, his sword hand, stung something fierce. The back of his hand bore a thin burn in the shape of a cross. The fresh wound, so raw and red, almost seemed to glow.<br> <br>Nail didn&#x2019;t even notice the bile rise in his throat, or the gentle twisting of his stomach, for he&#x2019;d seen the image of a glowing red cross on the back of his hand before.<br> <br>As a child, alone and afraid, he&#x2019;d seen it in his dreams.<br> <br><br> <br>Nail and Stefan sat alone, Nail&#x2019;s charcoal drawing unrolled on the table between them. The Grayken Spear Inn&#x2019;s tavern was abuzz about Dokie Liddle. Late winter days along the southwestern shores of Gul Kana were likely to bring sudden bursts of rain that ofttimes turned to snow. But lightning strikes so close to town were rare indeed. Dokie&#x2019;s injury had reined in the normally boisterous mood of the tavern to a somber crawl.<br> <br>Still, the barmaids were busy doing their jobs. And one young lady who worked here always had Nail&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;Ava Shay. She was his age, seventeen. Over the past year, when Nail could break away from working the mines with Shawcroft and come into town, they had grown close. At times Nail wondered if they weren&#x2019;t boyfriend and girlfriend. He found it nearly impossible to keep his mind off her.<br> <br>Thin and delicate as a willow leaf, Ava weaved her way through the tavern toward him, hands laden with two fresh mugs of beer. She wore a simple gray shift tied about the waist with a black sash. Her blond hair fell in rippling clusters down her back, and in the torrid glow of the tavern&#x2019;s many hearths, those silken curls danced about her face like flame. As she drew near, her eyes met his with open interest, deep-green eyes that always left him spellbound. He glanced down at his drawing, a sketch of a long-haired girl in a simple dress carrying a water pail through a knee-high meadow of flowers. Nail imagined the flowers to be white daisies, and the girl to be Ava Shay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sad about Dokie,&#x201d; she said upon reaching their table. &#x201c;Will he be okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His parents are with him,&#x201d; Stefan answered. &#x201c;As are Bishop Tolbret and Baron Bruk. The baron will bring further word, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ava placed a wooden mug of birch beer in front of Stefan. &#x201c;One for you.&#x201d; She slid a mug in front of Nail. &#x201c;And one for you, too, m&#x2019;dear.&#x201d; She saw his drawing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not near as talented as you, Nail, but Ol&#x2019; Man Leddingham displayed one of my fish carvings today.&#x201d; She motioned to the shelf above the bar that stretched along the far wall&#x2014;her wooden carving sat next to a clear jar holding the rare daggerlike teeth of a mermaid. &#x201c;If I carve some otters and seals, he said he&#x2019;ll place them on the mantels of the travelers&#x2019; rooms.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your work is terrific,&#x201d; Nail said, happy for her accomplishment.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so sweet.&#x201d; She smiled a winsome smile, then dipped a small curtsy in acknowledgment before making her way back toward the bar.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see Ava still sets her charms about you,&#x201d; Stefan said, pulling Nail&#x2019;s drawing across the table. &#x201c;Calls you m&#x2019;dear whenever you&#x2019;re in the Grayken Spear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She calls everyone m&#x2019;dear.&#x201d; Nail&#x2019;s eyes followed Ava as she drifted through the crowd. The tavern was fifty paces across and a hundred deep, and tables lined the breadth of it. A bar ran the length of the left side. The scarred surface of the wood floor was covered with a film of soot and ale. Cobwebs hid in the rafters, while the low-hung beams were draped with the pelts of silver-wolf and black bear. The walls were lined with the mounted heads of boar, elk, and stag. Near the door hung the ivory tusks of a walrus and long dried strips of grayken baleen. The owner of the inn, Ol&#x2019; Man Leddingham, tended to a haunch of venison cooking on a spit in the open hearth in the center of the room.<br> <br>Every Gallows Haven young man of seventeen and eighteen, most still in some form of armor to impress the girls, was crowded into the tavern. It was tradition. After arms training, the girls working at the Grayken Spear Inn prepared a meal for the conscripts. Nail lived for the arms training with Baron Bruk and the hot meal at the Grayken Spear afterward. It was one of the few times Shawcroft allowed him to come to town&#x2014;arms training was mandatory; it was the law.<br> <br>Stefan pushed the drawing back to Nail&#x2019;s side of the table. &#x201c;Ava seems quite taken with your drawing. She didn&#x2019;t smile once at me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You suffer from no lack of attention.&#x201d; Nail noticed Gisela Barnwell approach, her eyes fixed on Stefan, who was now blushing. Gisela set two steaming plates of food on their table, curtsied, and said, &#x201c;Poor Dokie,&#x201d; before heading back to the bar. The dainty girl, two years younger than Nail and Stefan, wore a wreath of blue heather on her head. She had recently been crowned Maiden Blue of the upcoming Mourning Moon Feast, the annual honor bestowed upon the fairest young girl in all of Gallows Haven.<br> <br>It was clear Gisela liked Stefan. But Stefan Wayland didn&#x2019;t see it. Nail&#x2019;s friend had the beginnings of a strong jaw and hawkish nose. Dark hair fell in a tumble over his shoulders. He had the hard eyes and tanned skin of one who had spent the last few years on Baron Bruk&#x2019;s grayken-hunting ship. Where Nail was strong and fast on the practice field with a sword, it was the longbow where Stefan excelled. He was a lock to win the archery competition against the conscripts from Tomkin Sty and Peddlers Point during the annual tournament between the towns. After all, he&#x2019;d won every Mourning Moon archery competition since he was ten. And from the look on Gisela&#x2019;s face when she&#x2019;d brought them their food, Stefan had likely won her, too.<br> <br>Nail knew how he himself looked to others. At seventeen he was bigger and stronger than most men in Gallows Haven. He had grayish-green eyes, a thin nose, and a pleasant smile on a youthful face under locks of blond. He continually flicked wild strands of hair from his face, a habit he couldn&#x2019;t shake, but a habit that made the girls notice him even more. Nail kept his hair just long enough to cover his ears&#x2014;thin ears that he felt poked out from his head a bit too much.<br> <br>Stefan had stopped eating, eyes staring into space.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eat,&#x201d; Nail said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mope; Dokie will be fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Stefan muttered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nail set his fork down. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll soon be dancing with Gisela at the Mourning Moon Feast like man and wife.&#x201d; He pointed a finger at his friend. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll ask her to dance even if I have to force open your mouth and move your lips about for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stefan smiled weakly. Zane Neville walked up.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have that beer if you&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; to do naught but stare at it.&#x201d; Zane plunked himself down on the seat beside Stefan, a heaping plate of food in hand. He snatched Stefan&#x2019;s beer as promised, and in two gulps, it was gone. Zane&#x2019;s shepherd dog, Beer Mug, sat next to him, long snout resting on the table. Zane slid a piece of smoked salmon the dog&#x2019;s way. Beer Mug gulped it down, tail thumping the floor. Zane&#x2019;s large dog reminded Nail of the stealthy silver-wolves that roamed the mountains near the gold mines above town. But unlike those wild wolves, Beer Mug was a good-natured fellow....</p><h2>The Lost Years of Jesus: Documentary Evidence of Jesus&#39; 17-Year Journey to the East</h2><p>The Gospels record Jesus age 12 in the temple, then age 30 at the river Jordan.

The family were struggling Polish immigrants, and despite Keats&#x2019;s obvious talent, his father worried that Ezra&#x2019;s dream of being an artist was an unrealistic one. But Ezra was determined. By high school he was winning prizes and scholarships. Later, jobs followed with the WPA and Marvel comics. But it was many years before Keats&#x2019;s greatest dream was realized and he had the opportunity to write and illustrate his own book.<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than two decades, Ezra had kept pinned to his wall a series of photographs of an adorable African American child. In Keats&#x2019;s hands, the boy morphed into Peter, a boy in a red snowsuit, out enjoying the pristine snow; the book became <i>The Snowy Day</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal, the first mainstream book to feature an African American child.

Each animal that ventures into the clearing is getting ready for winter&#x2019;s cold. Though the foliage glows, food is becoming harder to find: &#x201c;The mother bear snuffles for food among the flaming leaves. The cub snuffles too. But no luck.... Winter is coming.&#x201d; The girl&#x2019;s narration makes it clear that her family possesses a store of knowledge about the natural world. About skunks, she says, &#x201c;I can smell them before I see them. Not a bad smell; a real smell. My father says animals are true to themselves.&#x201d; In one of several spreads meticulously worked with feather-light strokes, LaMarche (A Single Pearl) looks down on both the skunks and the girl on her platform, doubling the sense of secret observation. Sketches of the skunks lie beside her. With meditative language, Johnston (The Cat with Seven Names) offers a vivid sense of the changing seasons and of stillness. LaMarche quietly and sensitively portrays a child who&#x2019;s comfortable spending hours alone, working on her own projects and observing&#x2014;a young naturalist. Ages 4&#x2013;8. (Aug.) -- Publishers Weekly, *STARRED REVIEW, <i>May 26, 2014</i><br><br>Armed with a sketchbook and patience, a young girl watches animals from a platform in a tree. With quiet appreciation, the narrator describes what she sees on visits made from September through late November to her special place on the edge of the woods. She watches a fox take the last apple from a tree. A bear mother &#x201c;snuffles for food&#x201d; with her cub. Honking Canada geese fly overhead. There are skunks, acorn woodpeckers, rabbits, chipmunks, a deer with still-spotted fawns and turkeys. One day the lucky girl even observes a lynx. &#x201c;I stay quiet, quiet / to keep it here&#x2014; / for a moment.&#x201d; Even on the gray, cold day on which no animals come, the narrator sits patiently, her back to readers, steadily waiting and watching. LaMarche&#x2019;s illustrations, done mostly in shades of orange and brown with acrylics, colored pencil and inks, beautifully and realistically portray the ever changing woods, trees, plants and animals. The girl&#x2019;s appreciation for all she sees and hears is as evident in her face and body language as it is in the text. While not as obviously place-specific as the prolific author&#x2019;s Desert Song, illustrated by Ed Young (2000), the flora and fauna are recognizably Californian&#x2014;but the appeal will be universal. This gentle, lyrical celebration of the natural world will reward similarly observant readers. (Picture book. 4-8) -- Kirkus Reviews, *STARRED REVIEW, <i>June 15, 2014</i><br><br>On a cold September day, a girl takes her binoculars, sketch pad, and pencils outdoors to draw the wildlife around her family&#x2019;s farm. She returns several times before late November, when the first snowflakes fall. Often observing from a platform in a tree, she sketches what she sees: a red fox, a bear with her cub, a lynx, a skunk family, woodpeckers, rabbits, chipmunks, a doe with two fawns, Canada geese, and wild turkeys. The geese are flying south, but the other animals are foraging for food as they prepare to winter in the woods and fields around the farm. Written from the girl&#x2019;s point of view, Johnston&#x2019;s text is plainspoken and natural sounding but poetic in effect, with graceful repetition: on most double-page spreads, the lines end with &#x201c;Winter is coming.&#x201d; Created with acrylics, colored pencils, and opaque inks, LaMarche&#x2019;s captivating illustrations convey the radiance of an autumn meadow, the girl&#x2019;s rapt attention to her surroundings, and the unique qualities of the animals she observes. Winter may be in the title, but this evocative picture book is best for reading aloud in the fall, when children can notice the subtle changes happening in their own outdoor spaces. A quiet, beautiful picture book to share. -- Booklist, *STARRED REVIEW, <i>August 1, 2014</i><br><br>As fall winds down to winter, a keen-eyed girl quietly observes the animals&#x2019; prepa- ration from her cleverly situated platform in a tree at the edge of a meadow. She watches deer and skunks, and spies a fox and a lynx, as the season grows colder and the animals scurry to find whatever food they can to fill up for the tough times ahead. Though the text is lengthy, Johnston makes it work, demonstrating her authorial chops with ragged-right prose that moves smoothly between naturalistic observation and lyricism (the deer &#x201c;nibble the brittle grass. They nibble at the edges of ferns. They nibble at nothing&#x201d;); careful use of rhythm and the periodic repeti- tion of &#x201c;winter is coming&#x201d; help structure the account of the move through fall. The illustrations, employing colored pencil, ink, and acrylic paint, use the realistic figures of girl and animals as the centerpieces of creative compositions: viewers peer down on the flying Canada geese to see the girl looking up at them from below, or perch alongside her in a neighboring pine as she sketches some busy chipmunks. The tree&#x2019;s curving limbs and solid trunk anchor hazy full-spread landscapes suffused with autumnal golds and russets. Literarily inclined youngsters will appreciate this as an entr�e to a nature study unit or a field trip involving wildlife observation. -- Bulletin, <i>September 2014</i><br><br>An empty sketchbook, freshly sharpened pencils, and binoculars set the stage for this luminous story about the powerful magic of being still and experiencing the natural world. Sitting in her tree house, using all her senses to witness the changing season, a girl sketches a variety of Northern animals and notes their habits as they forage for food. The short journal entries combine poetry with pragmatism, resulting in spare, elegant observations about nature: ?Dawn burns the sky./A flock of wild turkeys jostles by./They poke everyplace, muttering/food, food, food.? Although the variety of animals that she sees within a single season is rather implausible, the respect she has for nature and the life cycle keep the text grounded: ?I know animals/are best left alone./Maybe the deer will find enough food./Maybe not./ Soon they move on, nibbling.? Gorgeous acrylic and colored pencil illustrations show the wonder that the girl feels and evoke the experience of witnessing the layers of the natural world slowly revealing themselves as apparent stillness becomes full of life&#x2014;wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, and scurrying insects. This book unflinchingly faces the fact that the cold is coming, the lean season is approaching, and there are endings within the cycle of life. A touching reminder about the beauty of the natural world. -- School Library Journal, *STARRED REVIEW, <i>October 2014</i></p><h2>Introducing Game Theory: A Graphic Guide</h2><p><b>Why did countries engage in a nuclear arms race? How do we make decisions when we don&#x2019;t have all the information?

But it&#x2019;s not just about predicting your opponent&#x2019;s next play in a game of chess; conflict and cooperation lie at the heart of game theory, which is useful for understanding behaviour in everything from our social lives to business, global politics to evolutionary theory.<br><br>In <i>Introducing Game Theory</i>, economists Ivan and Tuvana Pastine explore this fascinating area, which looks beneath the surface of human behavior calling upon psychology, evolutionary biology, political science and sociology to explain why, when faced with a decision, we sometimes cooperate, sometimes clash, and sometimes act in a way that seems completely random.<br><br>Stylishly brought to life by regular <i>Guardian</i> illustrator Tom Humberstone, the book takes readers on a tour of the key ideas and thinkers, and puts you into a series of games that provide a new perspective on the world we live in.</p><p><b>Dr. Ivan</b> and <b>Dr. Tuvana Pastine</b> are American and Turkish university lecturers working in Ireland.

Written for the benefit of the students at the University of Rochester, where Lasch taught from 1970 until his death in 1994, it quickly established itself in typescript as a local classic&#x2014;a lively, witty, and historically minded alternative to the famous volume by William Strunk and E. B. White, <i>The Elements of Style</i>. </p><p>Now available for the first time in published form, <i>Plain Style</i> is fundamentally a clear, readable, practical guide to the timeless principles of effective composition. At the same time, however, in ways that Stewart Weaver explains in his critical introduction, it is a distinctive and revealing addition to the published work of an eminent American thinker. No mere primer, <i>Plain Style</i> is an essay in cultural criticism, a political treatise even, by one for whom directness, clarity, and honesty of expression were essential to the living spirit of democracy. </p><p>As the teachers and students who have for years benefited from its succinct wisdom will testify, <i>Plain Style</i> is an indispensable guide to writing and, indeed, Christopher Lasch's least-expected but perhaps most serviceable work.</p></p><p>Christopher Lasch (1932-1994) was Professor of History at the University of Rochester. Among his many books are The Culture of Narcissism, The Minimal Self, The True and Only Heaven, and Haven in a Heartless World. Stewart Weaver is Professor of History at the University of Rochester.The late Lasch, college history professor and the author of <i>The Culture of Narcissism </i>(1979), among other seminal works, so despaired of his graduate students' writing that he began to compile a list of common compositional errors. This list soon evolved into a full-fledged writing guide that was published for departmental use. Now, edited and with a long introduction-cum-biography by one of his colleagues, it is being marketed as a shorter, up-to-date alternative to Strunk &amp; White's <i>Elements of Style.</i> The guide is divided into six parts, covering the principles of literary construction; conventions governing punctuation, capitalization, typography, and footnotes; characteristics of bad writing; words often misused; words often mispronounced; and a table of proofreaders' marks. Lasch's wry, distinctive voice is evident throughout and, in parts, will provoke outright laughter. Here's his priceless comment on the word <i>lifestyle</i>: "The appeal of this tired but now ubiquitous phrase probably lies in the suggestion that life is largely a matter of style. Find something else to say about life." For serious word lovers. <i>Joanne Wilkinson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The first was marked by the publication of <em>The Origin of Species</em>. The second occurred in the early twentieth century, when Darwin's theories were merged with the study of genetics. Now the insights of Evo Devo are astonishing the biology world by showing how the endless forms of animals&#x2015;butterflies and zebras, trilobites and dinosaurs, apes and humans, are made and evolved.<br><br> Perhaps the most surprising finding of Evo Devo is the discovery that a small number of primitive genes led to the formation of fundamental organs and appendages in all animal forms. The gene that causes humans to form arms and legs is the same gene that causes birds and insects to form wings, and fish to form fins; similarly, one ancient gene has led to the creation of eyes across the animal kingdom. Changes in the way this ancient tool kit of genes is used have created all the diversity that surrounds us.<br><br> Sean Carroll is the ideal author to lead the curious on this intellectual adventure&#x2015;he is the acknowledged leader of the field, and his seminal discoveries have been featured in <em>Time</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>. 16 pages of color and 100 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>"Every animal form is the product of two processes--development from an egg and evolution from its ancestors," writes Sean B. Carroll in his introduction to <i>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</i>. The new science of "evo devo"--or evolutionary developmental biology--examines the relationships between those two processes, embryonic development and evolutionary changes, despite their radically different time scales. Carroll first offers a recap of how genes express themselves in a growing embryo, then peers into the life histories of real-life examples to explain how those genes have changed (or not changed) over millions of years of evolution. Paraphrasing Thomas Huxley, he asks us to consider evolution and development as two sides of the same coin. <blockquote> We may marvel at the process of an egg becoming an adult, but we accept it as an everyday fact. It is merely then a lack of imagination to fail to grasp how changes in this process that assimilated over long periods of time, far longer than the span of human experience, shape life's diversity." </blockquote> The book's second half is where Carroll really gets at the meat of evo devo, explaining how regulatory genes control such mysteries as individual and population changes in butterfly's spots, jaguar fur, and hominid skulls. Evo devo is one of the hottest areas of study in 21st-century biology, and Carroll's outline of the field is a great place to start understanding it. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Sean B.

Vaughan has previously written episodes of Swamp Thing and The Hood mini-series. His current work includes Ultimate X-Men and Ex-Machina. Pia Guerra is a new and rising star in comics. Y: The Last Man is her first published work.An adolescent male daydream becomes a nightmare in this convoluted SF thriller. Having somehow survived a plague that instantly killed all the other men on Earth, Yorick Brown finds himself the object of universal desire. Unfortunately, some of the women frantically chasing him are members of a lesbian Amazon cult that wants revenge for centuries of masculine oppression. Others are more interested in exploiting Yorick's unique immunity than in having sex with him. In this collection of eight issues of the monthly comic, Yorick bounces from one group to another as he also tries to discover why he was spared and whether there is any way to make the world safe for other men. Meanwhile, women debate whether the world is really a better place without men&#x2014;although the story so far shows that women are fully capable of taking over male roles in violence, conceit and general obtuseness. Guerra and Marzan's sedate art makes the extreme situations look convincing, and Vaughn's script keeps the interplay of different factions moving briskly even if readers can't be sure what each represents. Despite its outlandish premise, this works much better than it has any right to. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Originally published in 1973, this &#34;masterpiece on the mysticism of golf&#34; (San Francisco Chronicle) is now back in print f.</p><p>Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy's divine meditation on the royal and ancient game defied categorization when it was first published in 1972, and it still does. Instantly hailed as a classic, it is part novel, part philosophy, part myth, part mysticism, part enchantment, part golf instructional, and is altogether unique. This confluence of sports and the supernatural looks at both life and golf from the inside out. The book's central character is a wily Scotsman named Shivas Irons, a golf professional by vocation, and a shaman by design, who Murphy, as participant in his own novel, meets on the links of Burningbush, in 1956 Fife. The story of their round of golf together culminates in a wild night of whiskey and wisdom where their golf quite literally takes on a metaphysical glow as Shivas explains how the swing reflects the soul. It alters not only Murphy's game, it also radically alters his mind and inner vision--and it's truly unforgettable. For a golfer, <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i> is as essential as a set of clubs.A classic tale of sport and mysticism, here in a brand new audio production.<p>"Michael Murphy was on his way from California to India when he met Shivas Irons on a golfing links he calls Burningbush, in Scotland. They played 18 holes together and had a second go at the devilish 13th hole in the middle of a wild whiskey night--a mythic round that profoundly altered Murphy's game and his vision. . . Murphy's book is going to alter many visions. He's written a mystical tale capable of winning a constituency. I totally believed it and loved it."<br>--Nancy Weber, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"<i>Golf in the Kingdom</i> is a fascination...[Murphy has] put a lot of fine thoughts together here, most gracefully, and the book should have a long and prosperous life."<br>--Joseph Campbell</p><p>"Golf a mere game? A mirror of life? Something metaphysical and/or mystical? All of the above? Shivas Irons, a magical Scottish golf professional, puts those questions to all of us. Superb."<br>--C.

In 1979, the young dancer arrived in Texas as part of a cultural exchange, only to fall in love with America-and with an American woman. Two years later, through a series of events worthy of the most exciting cloak-and-dagger fiction, he defected to the United States, where he quickly became known as one of the greatest ballet dancers in the world. This is his story, told in his own inimitable voice.<br><br><b>THE BASIS FOR A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE</b></p><p><b>Li Cunxin</b> was born in a small village near the city of Qingdao, in northern China. At eighteen, he was selected to perform at the Houston Ballet, which led to a dramatic defection to the United States.

The portions dealing with his childhood and loving family in Qingdao are especially poignant, and the work as a whole unfolds with honesty, humor, and a quiet dignity. This book has wide appeal, for it concerns not only a dancer&#x2019;s coming-of-age in a turbulent time but also individual strength, self-discovery, and the triumph of the human spirit.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x2014;Library Journal</i></p><p><b>THE BERKLEY PUBLISHING GROUP</b> <br><b>Published by the Penguin Group</b> <br><b>Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</b> <br><b>375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, USA</b> <br>Penguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3, Canada <br>(a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.) <br>Penguin Books Ltd., 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England <br>Penguin Group Ireland, 25 St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd.) <br>Penguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, Australia <br>(a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty.

It is autumn, a beautiful October morning. The country air is cool but fresh.</p><p>The young girl hears happy music approaching her house. She is only eighteen, and she is nervous, frightened. She knows that many marriage introducers simply take money and tell lies. Some women from her village marry men who don&#x2019;t have all their functional body parts. Those women have to spend the rest of their lives looking after their husbands. Wife beating is common. Divorce is out of the question. Divorced women are humiliated, despised, suffering worse than an animal&#x2019;s fate. She knows some women hang themselves instead, and she prays this is not going to be her fate.</p><p>She prays to a kind and merciful god that her future husband will have two legs, two arms, two eyes and two ears. She prays that his body parts are normal and functional. She worries that he will not be kindhearted and will not like her. But most of all she worries about her unbound feet. Bound feet are still in fashion. Little girls as young as five or six have to tuck four toes under the big toe and squeeze them hard to stop the growth. It is extremely painful, and the girls have to change the cloth bandages and wash their feet daily to avoid infection. The tighter the feet are bound the smaller the feet will become. Eventually all five toes grow together. Infections often occur, and the girls are so crippled they have to walk mostly on their heels. But when this bride was about eight and her mother tried to bind her feet, two or three years later than was usual, she defied her and ran away. Her mother eventually gave up, but secretly she was pleased. A daughter with unbound feet could help do the hard chores. But would her future husband and in-laws think the same?</p><p>The groom is a young man of twenty-one. He leaves home before sunrise. Sixteen strong men are hired to carry two sedan chairs for the three-hour journey from his village to the bride&#x2019;s. There are trumpets, cymbals, gongs and bamboo flutes, and the bride&#x2019;s sedan chair is covered with red and pink silk banners and flowers. The groom&#x2019;s is a simple blue sedan chair, which will leave from the east side of the village and reenter from the west.</p><p>As soon as the groom&#x2019;s entourage leaves home, the women of his family start to prepare the house and the wedding feast to follow. They glue colored-paper cuttings all over the walls, doors and windows&#x2014;different shapes, with lucky words on them, to symbolize happiness and good fortune. They place a square table in the center of their courtyard and cover it with a red cloth. In the center they place nine huge bread rolls, called mantos, in the shape of a pagoda. There is also a metal bowl, with candlesticks and incense holders on either side. On the ground are two round bamboo mats.</p><p>The bride is in such a panicked state by the time her groom arrives. He wears a dark blue cotton mandarin gown and a big tall hat, with silk flowers pinned over his heart. He kneels, and kowtows three times, bowing his head all the way down to the floor, always facing north, always in the direction of the god of happiness.</p><p>Tea, sweets, roasted sunflower seeds and peanuts are then served. A lunch feast follows, but the cost of the meal will break the bride&#x2019;s family finances. Many relatives and friends chip in to help, but the favors and debts will have to be repaid in years to come. The groom&#x2019;s entourage has to be satisfied, however. The meal will affect her new family&#x2019;s attitude toward her. It will determine whether she will have a smooth or bumpy ride on the way to her in-laws&#x2019; house. The young bride remembers that a friend of her mother&#x2019;s was married a year before&#x2014;at her wedding, the musicians played funeral music and the carriers walked her around in circles, making her dizzy and sick. Even worse, the carriers lowered her sedan chair to the ground, which is very unlucky: that bride would end up with a life of hard work instead of a life of luxury. All this was caused by the in-laws&#x2019; dissatisfaction with the food that was served at her house.</p><p>While the groom&#x2019;s people drink their wine and eat their food, the bride sits on her bed, her kang, away from everyone, with her silk veil concealing her face. This is called the &#x201c;quiet sitting.&#x201d; She wears a long dark maroon gown, with pink silk flowers sewn onto it. Her hairpiece is full of beautiful colored hairpins and flowers, and is very heavy. She has no jewelery because her family is too poor.</p><p>Soon, her second brother secretly whispers to her through a crack in the door, &#x201c;My brother-in-law has all his moving parts!&#x201d; This is news from heaven. The young bride sobs with joy.</p><p>Toward the end of the meal, the bride&#x2019;s mother brings her a bowl of rice, a double-sided mirror and ten pairs of red chopsticks. The bride has to eat three mouthfuls of rice, and the last mouthful she spits into her mother&#x2019;s pocket. She has to keep some rice in her mouth to last all the way to her in-laws&#x2019; house before she can swallow, symbolizing that she will never starve along the entire journey of her life. Then she puts eight pairs of chopsticks into her mother&#x2019;s pocket. The remaining two pairs she keeps, the ones with chestnuts and dates tied on them, symbolizing the early arrival of sons.</p><p>The bride cannot stop shaking. Tears stream from her eyes as she spits the rice into the pocket. Soon she will become someone&#x2019;s wife and another family&#x2019;s daughter-in-law. She grabs her mother&#x2019;s hand, as if clutching onto a life-saving straw.</p><p>&#x201c;You silly girl,&#x201d; her mother says to her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry! You&#x2019;re going to a family with enough food. Do you want to be poor for the rest of your life?&#x201d; She takes out her handkerchief and gently wipes her daughter&#x2019;s tears and hugs her long and tight for the last time. &#x201c;My girl, I&#x2019;ll always miss you and love you. Take good care of your husband and he&#x2019;ll take good care of you. Obey him and make him happy. Bear many of his sons. Look after your mother-in-law like you&#x2019;ve looked after me. Be kind to her until she dies.&#x201d; She lowers the veil over her daughter&#x2019;s face, and leaves, feeling nothing but pain.</p><p>The bride sobs quietly for the first half of her journey to the groom&#x2019;s village. She has never left home before. She is terrified. At the halfway point one of the carriers shouts, &#x201c;Halfway point, flip your mirror!&#x201d; So she takes the mirror she&#x2019;s been given and flips it over: now she should forget her past and look forward to the future. Then she is met by a group of four carriers from the groom&#x2019;s village, to make the changeover. She doesn&#x2019;t touch the ground. The musicians continue their happy wedding tunes, and the carriers walk carefully along the uneven dirt road.</p><p>When she arrives at the groom&#x2019;s gate, the metal bowl on the table is already flaming with fire. The candle and incense are lit. The groom gets out of his sedan chair and waits for his bride, her face still concealed by her thick silk veil as she is assisted out of her sedan chair by two of his sisters. They walk together toward the table while a local wise man reads loudly an ancient poem. Few people understand it because few of them have ever gone to school, but the bride and groom kneel on the two round bamboo mats while they listen, and afterwards kowtow. The groom then takes his new bride&#x2019;s hands and helps her up. She cannot see the flames from the bowl on the table, but she can feel the intense heat. This fire is the fire of passion, the fire of love.</p><p>Before the bride takes her first step with her husband, the groom&#x2019;s fourth brother gently brushes the soles of the bride&#x2019;s shoes with a time-worn iron filled with burning coals, to give her warmth from the end of her body right up to her...</p></p><h2>Popular Mechanics Complete Car Care Manual</h2><p>For more than 100 years, the editors of <i>Popular Mechanics</i> have been providing car enthusiasts with the skills and confidence they need to keep their vehicles running right and looking great.

The &#34;call of the North&#34; tugs at her, making one young man&#39;s interest in her doubly attractive--but also filling her with uncertainty. Is Christine willing to give up her dreams of living in the North and let God help her choose a lifelong love?</p><p>As Canadian men volunteer for World War II in Janette Oke's <i>When Tomorrow Comes</i>, Christine Delaney recovers from her broken heart and finds solace in helping her adored brother Henry settle into married life with the widowed Amber and her young son Danny. However, the Delaney family's happiness is shattered when a terrible auto accident mars an anticipated family celebration. At this crucial turning point in her spiritual maturity, Christine must decide if she is willing to give up her dreams of living in the North, and let God help her choose between her suitors to find a lifelong love. <p> It's classic Oke here from cover to cover. Christian readers will appreciate that no matter what the circumstances, God is praised and everything works out for the best, even when things look grim. The writing is loose in spots-- characters "flush" repeatedly, and the dialogue is often stiff. Oke devotees will likely see these as minor glitches in a light, romantic novel that's penned in the tradition they've come to expect and enjoy. Readers who loved <i>Beyond the Gathering Storm</i> in Oke's "Canadian West" series will be more than content with this sweet sequel about the Delaney family. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p>Janette Oke, recipient of the 1992 ECPA President&#39;s Award and the 1999 CBA Life Impact Award for her significant contribution to the Christian book industry has also won both the Gold Medallion Award and the Christy Award for fiction along with the hearts of millions of readers!

But<i> No Shortcuts to the Top</i> is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.<br><br>A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, &#x201c;Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.&#x201d; It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air. <br><br></i>In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs&#x2019;s odyssey, <i>No Shortcuts to the Top </i>is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.</p></p><p><p>ED VIESTURS still climbs and seeks out new adventures. He lives on Bainbridge Island, Washington, with his wife and three children. DAVID ROBERTS is a veteran author of mountaineering books, including <i>On the Ridge Between Life and Death.</i></p><b>CHAPTER 1<br>Self</b>&#x2013;<b>Arrest</b><br><br>At last things seemed to be going our way. Inside our Camp III tent, at 24,300 feet, Scott Fischer and I crawled into our sleeping bags and turned off our headlamps. The next day, we planned to climb up to Camp IV, at 26,000 feet. On the day after, we would get up in the middle of the night, put on all our clothing, grab our gear and a little food, and set off for the summit of K2, at 28,250 feet the second-highest mountain in the world. From Camp IV, the 2,250 vertical feet of snow, ice, and rock that would stretch between us and the top could take as long as twelve hours to climb, since neither Scott nor I was using supplemental oxygen. We had agreed that if we hadn&#x2019;t reached the summit by two P.M., we&#x2019;d turn around&#x2014;no matter what. * It was the evening of August 3, 1992. Fifty-four days earlier, we had started our hike in to base camp on the Baltoro Glacier, which we had reached on June 21. Before the trip, even in my most pessimistic scenario I had never imagined that it could take us more than six weeks just to get in position for a summit push. But this expedition had seemed jinxed from the start&#x2014;by hideous weather, by minor but consequential accidents, by an almost chaotic state of disorganization within our team.<br><br>As usual in the midst of a several-day summit push at high altitude, Scott and I were too keyed up to fall asleep. We tossed and turned in our sleeping bags. Then suddenly, around ten P.M., the radio in our tent crackled to life. I turned on my headlamp, grabbed the walkie&#x2013;talkie, and listened intently. The voice on the radio was that of Thor Kieser, another American, calling from Camp IV, 1,700 feet above us. &#x201c;Hey, guys,&#x201d; Thor blurted out, his voice tense with alarm. &#x201c;Chantal and Alex aren&#x2019;t back. I don&#x2019;t know where they are.&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed in pure frustration. In the beam of my headlamp, I saw a kindred expression on Scott&#x2019;s face. Without exchanging a word, we knew what this meant. Our summit push was now on indefinite hold. Instead of moving up to Camp IV to get into position, the next day we would find ourselves caught up in a search&#x2014;and possibly a rescue. The jinx was alive and well.<br><br>On August 3, as Scott and I had made the long haul from base camp up to Camp III (a grueling 7,000 feet of altitude gain), Thor Kieser, Chantal Mauduit, and Aleksei Nikiforov had gone for the summit from Camp IV. Chantal, a very ambitious French alpinist, had originally been part of a Swiss team independent from ours. When all of her partners had thrown in the towel on the mountain and left for home, she had stayed on (illegally, in terms of the permit system) and in effect grafted herself onto our group. She was now the only woman on the mountain. Aleksei&#x2014;or Alex, as we called him&#x2014;was a Ukrainian member of the Russian quintet that made up the core of our team.<br><br>That morning, Alex and Thor had set out at five&#x2013;thirty a.m., Chantal not until seven. These starting times were much later than Scott and I would have been comfortable with, but the threesome had been delayed because of no shortcuts to the top high winds. Remarkably, climbing without bottled oxygen, Chantal caught up with the men and surged past them. Struggling in the thin air, Thor turned back a few hundred feet below the summit, unwilling to get caught out in the dark. Chantal summited at five p.m., becoming only the fourth woman ever to climb K2. Alex topped out only after dark, at seven p.m.<br><br>The proverbial two p.m. turn-around time isn&#x2019;t an iron&#x2013;clad rule on K2 (or on Everest, for that matter), but to reach the summit as late as Chantal and Alex did was asking for trouble. And trouble had now arrived. <br><br>On the morning of August 4, as Scott and I readied ourselves for the search and/or rescue mission that would cancel our own summit bid, we got another radio call from Thor. The two missing climbers had finally showed up at Camp IV, at seven in the morning, but they were in really bad shape. Chantal had been afraid to push her descent in the night and had bivouacked in the open at 27,500 feet. Three hours later, Alex had found her and talked her into continuing the descent with him&#x2014;possibly saving her life.<br><br>Staggering through the night, the pair had managed to stay on route (no mean feat in the dark, given the confusing topography of K2&#x2019;s domeshaped summit). But by the time they reached the tents at Camp IV, Chantal was suffering from snow blindness, a painful condition caused by leaving your goggles off for too long, even in cloudy weather. Ultraviolet rays burn the cornea, temporarily robbing you of your vision. Chantal was also utterly exhausted, and she thought she had frostbitten feet. In only marginally better shape, but determined to get down as fast as possible, Alex abandoned Chantal to Thor&#x2019;s safekeeping and pushed on toward our Camp III. He just said, &#x201c;Bye-bye&#x201d; and took off.<br><br>Thor himself was close to exhaustion from his previous day&#x2019;s effort, but on August 4 he gamely set out to shepherd a played&#x2013;out Chantal down the mountain. It&#x2019;s an almost impossible and incredibly dangerous task to get a person in that kind of shape down slopes and ridges that are no child&#x2019;s play for even the freshest climber. Thor had scrounged a ten-foot hank of rope from somewhere&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all he had to belay Chantal with, and maybe to rappel.<br><br>Over the radio to us, Thor had pleaded, &#x201c;Hey, you guys, I might need some help to get her down.&#x201d; So Scott and I had made the only conscionable decision: to go up and help. <br><br>As we were getting ready, we watched as Alex haltingly worked his way down the slope above, eventually stumbling toward camp. We went up a short distance to assist him, then helped him get into one of the tents, where we plied and plied him with liquids, since he was severely dehydrated. Meanwhile, surprisingly, he didn&#x2019;t show any concern for Chantal.<br><br>Going to the summit, both he and Chantal had pushed themselves over the edge, driven themselves to their very limits. It happens all the time on the highest mountains, but it&#x2019;s kind of ridiculous. To make matters worse, on August 4 the snow conditions were atrocious. Same with the weather: zero visibility. Scott and I tried to go, made it up the slope for a couple of hours, then had to turn around and head back to camp. We made plans for another attempt the following day.<br><br>We were in radio communication with Thor. He&#x2019;d started to bring Chantal down to Camp III, but he only got partway. They had to camp right in the middle of a steep slope, almost a bivouac, though Thor had been smart enough to bring a tent with him.<br><br>The next day, August 5, Scott and I got up, packed our gear, and started up again, hoping we could meet up with Thor and Chantal and help them back to our camp. At some point, we could see them through the mist and clouds, two little dots above. It was blowing hard, and little spindrift avalanches were coming down the slope we were climbing. Part of it was stuff Thor and Chantal were kicking off from way above, stuff that by the time it got to us was a little bigger. But no really big slides. I&#x2019;d scrounged a fiftyfoot length of rope, with which Scott and I were tied together, because of the crevasses that riddled the slope.<br><br>At one point, Scott was above me. Something just didn&#x2019;t feel right. I yelled up to Scott, &#x201c;Wait a minute, this is not a good slope.&#x201d; It was loaded, ready to avalanche. If you&#x2019;ve done enough climbing, you can feel the load on a slope. I attribute that sense to the years of guiding I&#x2019;d done by that point in my life. At that time, Scott hadn&#x2019;t done as much guiding as I had.<br><br>We stopped in our tracks. I said, &#x201c;Man, let&#x2019;s not get ourselves killed doing this. Let&#x2019;s discuss this.&#x201d; Scott sat down facing out, looking down at me. I figured, if a big spindrift slide comes down now, we&#x2019;re going to get washed off the face.<br><br>I started digging a hole with my ice ax, thinking I might protect myself if a slide came from above. After a few moments, I looked up just in time to see Scott engulfed by a wave of powder. He disappeared from sight. At once I tucked into my hole and anchored myself, lying on top of my ax, the pick dug into the slope. Bracing myself for impact, I thought, <i>Here it comes</i>. <br><br>It got dark; it got quiet. I felt snow wash over my back. The lights literally went out. I hung on and hung on. And then, the avalanche seemed to subside. I thought I&#x2019;d saved myself. I thought, <i>Wow, my little trick worked</i>.<br><br>But the fact was, Scott had been blindsided. He was tumbling with the snow, getting swept down the face. He hurtled past me, out of control. Scott was a big guy, maybe 225 pounds. I weigh 165.<br><br>The rope came tight. Boom! There was no way I could hold both of us. I got yanked out of my hole, like getting yanked out of bed. I knew instantly what had happened. Scott was plummeting down the mountain, with me in tow, connected by what should have been our lifeline. And there were 8,000 vertical feet of cliff below us.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re caught in an avalanche and careening down the slope, there are several ways of trying to save yourself. One of the ways is called a selfarrest. The idea is to get your ice ax underneath your body, lie on it with all your weight, hold on to the head, and try to dig the pick into the slope, like a brake.<br><br>I&#x2019;d learned the self-arrest when I&#x2019;d started climbing, and as a guide I&#x2019;d taught it to countless clients. So the instinct was automatic. It ran through my head even as I was getting jerked and pummeled around by the avalanche: &#x201c;Number one: Never let go of your ax. Number two: Arrest! Arrest! Arrest!&#x201d; I kept jabbing with the pick of the ax, but the snow beneath me was so dry, the pick just kept slicing through. I&#x2019;d reach and dig, reach and dig.<br><br>Yet I wasn&#x2019;t frantic.

Some fifteen thousand years ago, the majestic river provided Paleolithic humans with the routes by which early man began to explore the continent's interior. Since then, the river has been the site of historical significance, from the arrival of Spanish and French explorers in the 16th century to the Civil War. George Washington fought his first battle near the river, and Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman both came to President Lincoln's attention after their spectacular victories on the lower Mississippi.</p><p>In the 19th century, home-grown folk heroes such as Daniel Boone and the half-alligator, half-horse, Mike Fink, were creatures of the river. Mark Twain and Herman Melville led their characters down its stream in <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>The Confidence-Man</i>. A conduit of real-life American prowess, the Mississippi is also a river of stories and myth.</p><p>Schneider traces the history of the Mississippi from its origins in the deep geologic past to the present. Though the busiest waterway on the planet today, the Mississippi remains a paradox&#x2015;a devastated product of American ingenuity, and a magnificent natural wonder.</p></p><p><b>Paul Schneider</b> is the acclaimed author of <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, <i>Brutal Journey</i>, <i>The Enduring Shore</i>, and <i>The Adirondacks</i>, a <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Notable Book. He and his family live in West Tisbury, Massachusetts.<p>Prologue</p> <p>The American Watershed</p> <p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter from what perspective you look at the river in the middle of the continent&#x2014;geologically, ecologically, prehistorically, ethnographically, economically, industrially, socially, musically, literarily, culturally, or over the gunnels of your canoe midstream. It&#x2019;s impossible to imagine America without the Mississippi. The river&#x2019;s history is our history.</p> <p>Similarly, just as a tree without branches and roots is merely lumber, it is pointless to separate the Mississippi from its tributaries. The upper Mississippi River, as the river above St. Louis is known, rises near the Canadian border at Lake Itasca in Minnesota. That stream has pride of name, of course, but the Missouri, which begins some nine thousand feet above sea level in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and joins the upper Mississippi at St. Louis, is a far longer river. The Arkansas River, which rises near Leadville, Colorado, and joins the Lower Mississippi halfway between Memphis and Vicksburg, is also longer than the Upper Mississippi. So is the Red River of the South, which rises in the Texas Panhandle. The relatively short Ohio, meanwhile, which rises in western Pennsylvania and Virginia and joins the Upper Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois, to form the Lower Mississippi, brings more water to the party than any two other tributaries combined. The truth is that any moving water south of the Great Lakes and between the Appalachians and the Rockies&#x2014;with the exception of a few relative trickles&#x2014;is going to Louisiana. The Mississippi, the Mississippi watershed, the Mississippi basin, the Mississippi catchment&#x2014;41 percent of the continental United States&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all one river.</p> <p>Parts of the river are older than the Atlantic Ocean. Parts of it were created yesterday. The Mississippi and its tributaries were the routes by which the first humans explored North America, and the earliest evidence (for the time being) of human habitation of the continent is in a rock shelter overlooking a small tributary of the Ohio in Pennsylvania. Agriculture developed independently in the Mississippi River basin, and with it, surplus food for artists, warmongers, shamans, and potentates. For millennia, cultures rose and fell in the watershed, often leaving behind elaborate earthworks and exquisite artifacts but just as often disappearing without leaving much behind. Eventually the greatest pre-Columbian city in North America was built beside the Mississippi River at Cahokia, in Illinois.</p> <p>The corpse of the first European known to have explored the interior of North America&#x2014;Hernando de Soto&#x2014;was sunk in the Mississippi River nearly five hundred years ago. Two hundred years later George Washington got his first taste of battle during an engagement in the watershed over whether Britain or France would control the river. That skirmish started the Seven Years&#x2019; War, the first global war, which Americans know as the French and Indian War.</p> <p>In many ways, the story of the Mississippi basin since the end of the French and Indian War is also the story of the federal government of the United States. The taxes that American tea-partiers revolted against were levied to pay for Britain&#x2019;s wars in the watershed. King George&#x2019;s attempts to control the pace of settlement across the Alleghenies was one of the intolerable acts of 1774 later cited in the Declaration of Independence.</p> <p>After the American Revolution, the one tangible asset the national government owned was the land west of the Appalachians. The first war fought by the newly independent United States was therefore to convince the resident Indians of that new political and military reality. The first road financed by the federal government of the United States was built to get to the watershed; the first civil works built by the Army Corps of Engineers was to improve navigation in the watershed; the first scientific publication by the Smithsonian Institution was a study of the archaeology of the watershed; the first request for federal disaster relief came from Missouri, after the New Madrid earthquakes on the Mississippi River in 1811; the first efforts by the national government to impose safety regulations on a private industry were the steamboat acts of 1838 and 1852.</p> <p>The Civil War was largely about who would control the lands west of the river: slave owners or Free-Soilers. John Brown lost one son in &#x201c;Bloody Kansas&#x201d; before losing another at Harpers Ferry, and <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>&#x2014;the book by &#x201c;the little woman who started this big war&#x201d;&#x2014;is about a slave sold &#x201c;down the river&#x201d; from Kentucky. Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman both came to President Lincoln&#x2019;s attention after their successes on the Mississippi River, and the siege of Vicksburg was a major turning point of the war, splitting the Slave States and giving undisputed control of the river to the North. After the Civil War the struggle for the watershed continued in an endless series of small and ugly campaigns against various Native American resisters. The last pitched battle fought between Native Americans and the United States Army was near the top of the river at Leech Lake, Minnesota, two years before the twentieth century.</p> <p>Jazz was born in New Orleans, and zydeco in the bayou. The blues originated in the delta, while rock and roll poured out of Memphis and bluegrass and country music trickled down the Tennessee and the Cumberland Rivers. Cowboy tunes floated off the plains via the Red River, the Platte, and the Arkansas. The river had one Mark Twain, though it&#x2019;s worth remembering that Melville also wrote a novel about the Mississippi. Riverboats and pirates, gamblers and slaves, hustlers and landscape painters, loggers and catfishers, tourists and missionaries: it is a river of stories and a river of myth. It&#x2019;s Paul Robeson sitting on a cotton bale, Daniel Boone floating on a flatboat, and Paul Bunyan cutting trees in the neighborhood of<i> Little House in the Big Woods</i>.</p> <p>The oil industry was hatched in the headwaters of the Ohio, and the steel industry at Pittsburgh. The Rust Belt, in many ways, is synonymous with the Ohio and upper Mississippi Rivers in part because the first heavy industry was building steamboats. Lead and zinc in world-leading quantities came out of Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas. The river is still today the busiest waterway on the planet, with more than half a billion metric tons of grain, coal, petroleum, sand, salt, chemicals, and other products moving up and down the world&#x2019;s largest plumbing project, into which, for better or worse, the river has been transformed by the Congress of the United States.</p> <p>It is tempting to think of the river as a caged animal, locked behind several centuries&#x2019; worth of public works. My guess is that the Mississippi itself doesn&#x2019;t really care about such things any more than it cared about the Pleistocene&#x2019;s mile-high walls of ice, which first sent its northern sources southward. Or the rising of the Rocky Mountains half a billion years ago, hemming it in on the west. Or the volcanoes and asteroids that rained ash and dust into its waters. This is not at all to say that there are not real and serious consequences to our compulsive tinkering with the Mississippi. Nor is it to turn a blind eye to the noxious soup of fertilizer and pesticides that our addiction to cheap food and ethanol has made of the lower river. It is only to say that long after we the people reap what our congresses have sown, for good or ill, the Mississippi River will be there.</p> <p>Is there. Make the effort to get your feet muddy and you&#x2019;ll find that the Mississippi is a very real river of water that will bring you joy and adventure if you step away from your vehicle and experience it wherever you find it. It is a magnificent creature of unsurpassed beauty, and it&#x2019;s sliding past Natchez and St. Louis as you read these words in the dark or in daylight. It&#x2019;s at Davenport and Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and Little Rock. It&#x2019;s trickling off of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico heading for Texas, and past the Seneca Indian Casino in western New York State. It&#x2019;s sitting as snow up in Jackson Hole, boiling up in great swirls around Tower Rock, Illinois, and licking at the levees by the aquarium in New Orleans. The river is always a willing traveling companion.</p> <p>Go down to the water, whether it be the main stream at Venice, Louisiana, or the creek outside Brown&#x2019;s Cave in southern Missouri, or even the dry bed of the Cimarron up near Clovis, New Mexico. The longer you spend on the river, the more likely it is that the stream will draw out of you what needs to be drawn out. Not to replace it with something else; unlike lakes, rivers are never about accumulation. The flow itself is the thing that will catch your conscience like a fallen leaf.</p> <p>Near the end of the process of writing this book I met a woman in Jeanerette, Louisiana, who thought she knew me, though she did not. It was an early Sunday morning in June, and I was canoeing down the Bayou Teche with a good friend from high school, Loren Demerath. Three thousand years ago the Bayou Teche was the main route of the Mississippi River, and history suggests that in some distant future it will surely regain that distinction. Today, however, Bayou Teche is a small distributary stream carrying a tiny share of the Mississippi basin&#x2019;s waters from Port Barre, Louisiana, through the heart of the Cajun country roughly 125 miles to the Gulf of Mexico below Morgan City. I wanted to explore it for those reasons, of course, but also for the zydeco nights in small towns along the way, gorging on jambalaya and crawfish.</p> <p>It was the prospect of finding a legendary local bakery that brought Loren and me to shore in Jeanerette that morning. Le Jeune&#x2019;s Hot French Bread was closed, however, and we were walking empty-handed back down the empty Main Street when a lone woman yelled from across street, &#x201c;Hey I know you! I know you!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you. You&#x2019;re from around here. Have you seen my friend?&#x201d; she asked when she caught up with us. We apologized. She seemed a bit out of sorts, as if perhaps she was struggling with her sense of reality. But she was friendly, and gregarious, and said several times, &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve seen you two around here. You must know my friend Tim. Have you seen my old friend Tim Landry?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, we don&#x2019;t know anyone here,&#x201d; Loren explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just paddling down the bayou in a canoe and stopped here in town for breakfast.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she hollered, and instantly began to sing at the top of her lungs:</p> <p>&#x201c;Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh . . .&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman was dancing in the street in the morning sunshine, plumb crazy with her own brand of river madness. We couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh and sing along, however, trying our best to keep up with the old Hank Williams lyrics she obviously knew by heart.</p> <p>Son of a gun, we&#x2019;re going to have some fun on the bayou.</p> <p>Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file gumbo</p> <p>Son of a gun, gonna have some fun on the bayou.</p> <p>We walked away down Main Street toward our canoe and her voice faded off in the distance as she went looking in the opposite direction for Tim Landry. We heard her again, however, an hour later as we paddled through the warming hours of midmorning. She was up on the bank somewhere in the shade where we couldn&#x2019;t see her, but there is no doubt it was she. All of a sudden her voice rang out like a bayou siren: &#x201c;Son of a gun, gonna have some fun. . . .&#x201d; She was accompanied this time by a happy-sounding man, and they both serenaded us from the canopy of trees until we were around the corner and out of sight.</p> <p>Only later still, when Loren and I were laughing and retelling each other the day&#x2019;s wacky turn did I realize with a start that Tim Landry was the name of my very first friend in life, a fun-loving water rat of a kid whom I haven&#x2019;t seen or thought of in forty years or more. By the time I remembered old Timmy and his leaky little rowboat, however, it was much too late to turn around and paddle back up the once and future Mississippi.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2013 by Paul Schneider<br></p></p><h2>Love without Conditions (Reflections on the Christ Mind): Reflections of the Christ Mind, Part I</h2><p>The incredible book from Jesus calling us to awaken to our own Christhood.

While Klimt is largely revered for his opulent, symbol-laden portraits of the Viennese bourgeoisie, these works were just one aspect of his artistic expression. His landscapes represent an important facet of his career and are a valuable contribution to the school of European nature painting. For many years the artist travelled to the Austrian and Italian countryside during the summer, where he took advantage of the extraordinary light and spectacular hues to paint and sketch landscapes. Among the most exquisite of Klimt&#39;s landscapes are those in which he experimented with composition and style.

For many years the artist traveled to the Austrian and Italian countryside during the summer, where he took advantage of the extraordinary light and spectacular hues. Among the most exquisite of Klimt&#x2019;s landscapes are those in which he experimented with composition and style; many of them reveal the influence of his contemporaries. Accompanied by essays from scholars, the images reproduced in this book comprise all extant landscapes from this brilliant artist which, though few in number, are made even more valuable by their scarcity.Now in flexi-cover, this visually stunning collection of Klimt&#39;s landscape paintings brings to light a lesser-known aspect of the Viennese painter&#39;s uvre.

He also explains how, on each aspect of nature and life, scientists have reached the understanding we have today, who made the key discoveries, who their opponents were and why certain ideas won. <br>Brimful of wit, fascinating personal experience and high scholarship, this book may well be our best introduction yet to the complex history of life on Earth.<br>A Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection&nbsp;&nbsp; With 32 pages of photographs</p><p>"The excitement of discovery cannot be bought, or faked, or learned from books," London Natural History Museum senior paleontologist Richard Fortey writes in <i>Life</i>. The first chapter, an engrossing account of an Arctic fossil-hunting expedition he undertook as a university student, will bring shivers to anyone who has ever ignored cold hands, hunger, and filthy socks to keep looking for something new, some piece of rock or bit of plant that may hold the key to the gleaming certainty of understanding. Fortey's descriptions of scruffy field assistants and eccentrically brilliant scientists are easily as interesting as the billions of years of evolution he so imaginatively describes. After all, the fossil record has not been accepted without controversy, and the arguments among fallible evolutionary biologists as they refined their theories make for great reading. But it is the little animals that make up our distant ancestry that are the focus here. The often mysterious fossils they left behind are like a history book in a language we don't know--the history of bugs and birds, humans and cauliflowers. One by one, Fortey reveals how the puzzles of paleontology have been subjected to the scientific method and to the politics and personal ambitions of academia, until a beautifully clear path is traced from the very first traces of life all the way across the eons to the advent of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Fortey's elegantly written tour lets us share his passion for ancient seas and the animals that frolicked in them, and understand how time and chance contributed to the biography of us all. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Praise from England for Richard Fortey's Life<br><br>"Life is a great joy to read . . . Fortey's narrative jumps from an obscure primeval mollusc to a piece of poetry, to an intellectual fashion; from an arid Australian desert to a quick walk in Charles Darwin's garden and then back to the strange histories that are written in rocks . . . <br>He writes powerfully and simply, and is, it seems, almost overwhelmed with a sense of beauty and intellectual excitement, and never-ending discovery."<br>--Minette Marrin, Literary Review<br><br>"Fortey leads us in a dance through time that is enthralling . . . I will turn to this book again and again for its richness of detail. Its breadth and readability are complemented by the cohesiveness of its narrative, a happy characteristic lacking in nearly all current scientific <br>writing . . . I strongly recommend you read this book."<br>--Lynn Margulis, Times Higher Education Supplement<br><br>"The tale of the evolution of animals and plants of all shapes and sizes, their invasion of land, continental drift, mass extinctions, and the rise of mammals, including humans . . . Fortey says that Darwin's view of the natural world informs his narrative as pervasively as grammar does a novel. His prose, like Darwin's, is spare, confident, and unadorned. As his impressive synthesis of evolution unfolds, a distant world is brought to life."<br>--The Economist<br><br>"This marvellous book works as a biography of all of us (and, as he points out, all cauliflowers too) by an opinionated biographer whose eye for detail and analogy across a huge range of reference uncovers all kinds of intelligible unity for the reader."<br>--Francis Spufford, Evening Standard</p><h2>Three Sisters, Three Queens (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;There is only one bond that I trust: between a woman and her sisters.

The three sisters will become the queens of England, Scotland, and France.<br> <br>United by family loyalties and affections, the three queens find themselves set against each other. Katherine commands an army against Margaret and kills her husband James IV of Scotland. But Margaret&#x2019;s boy becomes heir to the Tudor throne when Katherine loses her son. Mary steals the widowed Margaret&#x2019;s proposed husband, but when Mary is widowed it is her secret marriage for love that is the envy of the others.

Really, I think of myself as the one and only Tudor princess, for my sister Mary is too young to do more than be brought in by her nurse at suppertime, and taken out again. I make sure Mary&#x2019;s nursemaids are quite clear that she is to be shown to our new sister-in-law, and then go. There is no profit in letting her sit up at the table, or gorge on crystallized plums. Rich things make her sick and if she gets tired she will bawl. She is only five years old, far too young for state occasions. Unlike me; I am all but twelve. I have to play my part in the wedding; it would not be complete without me. My lady grandmother, the king&#x2019;s mother, said so herself.<br> <br>Then she said something that I couldn&#x2019;t quite hear, but I know that the Scots lords will be watching me to see if I look strong and grown-up enough to be married at once. I am sure I am. Everyone says that I am a bonny girl, stocky as a Welsh pony, healthy as a milkmaid, fair, like my younger brother Harry, with big blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be next,&#x201d; she says to me with a smile. &#x201c;They say that one wedding begets another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have to travel as far as Princess Katherine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home on visits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will.&#x201d; My lady grandmother&#x2019;s promise makes it a certainty. &#x201c;You are marrying our neighbor, and you will make him our good friend and ally.&#x201d;<br> <br>Princess Katherine had to come all the way from Spain, miles and miles away. Since we are quarreling with France, she had to come by sea, and there were terrible storms and she was nearly wrecked. When I go to Scotland to marry the king, it will be a great procession from Westminster to Edinburgh of nearly four hundred miles. I shan&#x2019;t go by sea, I won&#x2019;t arrive sick and sopping wet, and I will come and go from my new home to London whenever I like. But Princess Katherine will never see her home again. They say she was crying when she first met my brother. I think that is ridiculous. And babyish as Mary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I dance at the wedding?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Harry shall dance together,&#x201d; my lady grandmother rules. &#x201c;After the Spanish princess and her ladies have shown us a Spanish dance. You can show her what an English princess can do.&#x201d; She smiles slyly. &#x201c;We shall see who is best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; I pray. Out loud I say: &#x201c;A basse danse?&#x201d; It is a slow grand grown-up dance which I do very well, actually more walking than dancing.<br> <br>&#x201c;A galliard.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t argue; nobody argues with my lady grandmother. She decides what happens in every royal household, in every palace and castle; my lady mother the queen just agrees.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to rehearse,&#x201d; I say. I can make Harry practice by promising him that everyone will be watching. He loves to be the center of attention and is always winning races and competing at archery and doing tricks on his pony. He is as tall as me, though he is only ten years old, so we look well together if he doesn&#x2019;t play the fool. I want to show the Spanish princess that I am just as good as the daughter of Castile and Aragon. My mother and father are a Plantagenet and a Tudor. Those are grand enough names for anyone. Katherine needn&#x2019;t think that we are grateful for her coming. I, for one, don&#x2019;t particularly want another princess at court.<br> <br><br> <br>It is my lady mother who insists that Katherine visit us at Baynard&#x2019;s Castle before the wedding, and she is accompanied by her own court, who have come all the way from Spain&#x2014;at our expense, as my father remarks. They enter through the double doors like an invading army, their clothes, their speech, their headdresses completely unlike ours and, at the center of it all, beautifully gowned, is the girl that they call the &#x201c;infanta.&#x201d; This too is ridiculous, as she is fifteen and a princess, and I think that they are calling her &#x201c;baby.&#x201d; I glance across at Harry to see if he will giggle if I make a face and say &#x201c;ba-aby,&#x201d; which is how we tease Mary, but he is not looking at me. He is looking at her with goggle-eyes, as if he is seeing a new horse, or a piece of Italian armor, or something that he has set his heart on. I see his expression, and I realize that he is trying to fall in love with her, like a knight with a damsel in a story. Harry loves stories and ballads about impossible ladies in towers, or tied to rocks, or lost in woods, and somehow Katherine impressed him when he met her before her entry into London. Perhaps it was her ornate veiled litter, perhaps it was her learning, for she speaks three languages. I am so annoyed&#x2014;I wish he was close enough for me to pinch him. This is exactly why no one younger than me should play a part in royal occasions.<br> <br>She is not particularly beautiful. She is three years older than me but I am as tall as her. She has light brown hair with a copper tinge to it, only a little darker than mine. This is, of course, irritating: who wants to be compared to a sister-in-law? But I can hardly see it, for she wears a high headpiece and a thick concealing veil. She has blue eyes like mine too, but very fair eyebrows and lashes; obviously, she&#x2019;s not allowed to color them in like I do. She has pale creamy skin, which I suppose is admirable. She is tiny: tiny waist pinched in by tight lacing so she can hardly breathe, tiny feet with the most ridiculous shoes I have ever seen, gold-embroidered toes and gold laces. I don&#x2019;t think that my lady grandmother would let me wear gold laces. It would be vanity and worldly show. I am sure that the Spanish are very worldly. I am sure that she is.<br> <br>I make certain that my thoughts don&#x2019;t show on my face as I examine her. I think she is lucky to come here, lucky to be chosen by my father to marry my elder brother Arthur, lucky to have a sister-in-law like me, a mother-in-law like my mother and&#x2014;more than anything else&#x2014;a grandmother-in-law like Lady Margaret Beaufort, who will make very sure that Katherine does not exceed her place which has been appointed by God.<br> <br>She curtseys and kisses my lady mother and, after her, my lady grandmother. This is how it should be; but she will soon learn that she had better please my lady grandmother before anybody. Then my lady mother nods to me and I step forward, and the Spanish princess and I curtsey together at the same time, to exactly the same depth, and she steps forward and we kiss on one cheek and then the other. Her cheeks are warm and I see that she is blushing, her eyes filling with tears as if she is missing her real sisters. I show her my stern look, just like my father when someone is asking him for money. I am not going to fall in love with her for her blue eyes and pretty ways. She need not imagine she is going to come into our English court and make us look fat and stupid.<br> <br>She is not at all rebuffed; she looks right back at me. Born and raised in a competitive court with three sisters, she understands rivalry. Worse, she looks at me as if she finds my stern look to be not at all chilling, perhaps even a little comical. That is when I know that this is not a young woman like my ladies-in-waiting who has to be pleasant to me whatever I do, or like Mary, who has to do whatever I say. This young woman is an equal, she will consider me, she might even be critical. I say in French: &#x201c;You are welcome to England,&#x201d; and she replies in stilted English: &#x201c;I am pleased to greet my sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>My lady mother lays herself out to be kind to this, her first, daughter-in-law. They talk together in Latin and I cannot follow what they are saying so I sit beside my mother and look at Katherine&#x2019;s shoes with the gold laces. My mother calls for music, and Harry and I start a round, an English country song. We are very tuneful and the court takes up the chorus and it goes round and round until people start to giggle and lose their places. But Katherine does not laugh. She looks as if she is never silly and merry like Harry and me. She is overly formal, of course, being Spanish. But I note how she sits&#x2014;very still, and with her hands folded in her lap as if she were sitting for a portrait&#x2014;and I think: actually, that looks rather queenly. I think I will learn to sit like that.<br> <br>My sister Mary is brought in to make her curtsey, and Katherine makes herself ridiculous by going down on her knees so their faces are level and she can hear her childish whisper. Of course Mary cannot understand a word of either Latin or Spanish, but she puts her arms around Katherine&#x2019;s neck and kisses her and calls her &#x201c;thithter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am your sister,&#x201d; I correct her, giving her little hand a firm tug. &#x201c;This lady is your sister-in-law. Can you say sister-in-law?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, she can&#x2019;t. She lisps, and everyone laughs again and says how charming, and I say: &#x201c;Lady Mother, shouldn&#x2019;t Mary be in bed?&#x201d; Then everyone realizes how late it is and we all go out with bobbing torches to see Katherine leave, as if she were a queen crowned and not merely the youngest daughter of the King and Queen of Spain, and very lucky to marry into our family: the Tudors.<br> <br>She kisses everyone good night and when it is my turn, she puts her warm cheek to mine and says: &#x201c;Good night, Sister&#x201d; in that stupid accent, in her patronizing way. She draws back and sees my cross face and she gives a little ripple of laughter. &#x201c;Oho!&#x201d; she says, and pats my cheek as if my bad temper does not trouble her. This is a real princess, as naturally royal as my mother; this is the girl who will be Queen of England; and so I don&#x2019;t resent the pat, more like a caress. I find that I like her and dislike her, all together, all at once.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you will be kind to Katherine,&#x201d; my mother says to me as we come out of her private chapel after Prime the next morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not if she thinks she&#x2019;s going to come here and lord it over all of us,&#x201d; I say briskly. &#x201c;Not if she thinks she is going to act as if she is doing us a favor. Did you see her shoelaces?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother laughs with genuine amusement. &#x201c;No, Margaret. I did not see her shoelaces, nor did I ask you for your opinion of her. I told you of my hope: that you will be kind to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I say, looking down at my missal with the jeweled cover. &#x201c;I hope that I am gracious to everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is far from her home and accustomed to a big family,&#x201d; my mother says. &#x201c;She will certainly need a friend, and you might enjoy the company of an older girl. I had lots of sisters at home when I was growing up, and I value them, more and more every year. You too might find that your women friends are your truest friends, your sisters are the keepers of your memories and hopes for the future.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She and Arthur will stay here?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;They will live with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother rests her hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;I wish they could stay; but your father thinks they should go to Arthur&#x2019;s principality and live at Ludlow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does my lady grandmother think?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother gives a little shrug. That means it has been decided. &#x201c;She says the Prince of Wales must govern Wales.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll still have me at home.&#x201d; I put my hand over hers to keep her beside me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll still be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I count on you,&#x201d; she says reassuringly.<br> <br><br> <br>I have only one moment alone with my brother Arthur before the wedding. He walks with me in the long gallery. Below, we can hear the musicians striking up another dance, and the buzz of people drinking and chattering and laughing. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to bow so low to her,&#x201d; I say abruptly. &#x201c;Her father and mother are new-come to their thrones just like our father. She has nothing to be so very proud of. They&#x2019;re no better than us. They&#x2019;re not an ancient line.&#x201d;<br> <br>He flushes. &#x201c;You think her proud?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Without reason.&#x201d; I heard my grandmother say exactly this to my lady mother so I know it is right.<br> <br>But Arthur argues. &#x201c;Her parents conquered Spain and took it back from the Moors. They are the greatest crusaders in the world. Her mother is a queen militant. They have extraordinary wealth and own half of the unmapped world. Some grounds for pride there, surely?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s that, I suppose,&#x201d; I say begrudgingly. &#x201c;But we are Tudors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; he agrees with a little laugh. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t impress everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it does,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Especially now . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither of us says any more; we are both aware that there are many heirs to the English throne, dozens of Plantagenet boys, our mother&#x2019;s kinsmen, still living at our court, or run away to exile. Father has killed my mother&#x2019;s cousins in battles, and destroyed more than one pretender: he executed our cousin Edward two years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think her proud?&#x201d; he challenges me. &#x201c;Has she been rude to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I spread my hands in the gesture of surrender that my mother makes when she is told that my lady grandmother has overruled her. &#x201c;Oh, she doesn&#x2019;t bother to talk to me, she has no interest in a mere sister. She is too busy being charming, especially to Father. Anyway, she can hardly speak English.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she just shy? I know that I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would she be shy? She&#x2019;s going to be married, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be Queen of England, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be your wife. Why would she be anything but completely delighted with herself?&#x201d;<br> <br>Arthur laughs and hugs me. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you think that there is nothing better in the world but to be Queen of England?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I say simply. &#x201c;She should realize it and be grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you will be Queen of Scotland,&#x201d; he points out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s grand too. You have that to look forward to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do, and I certainly won&#x2019;t ever be anxious and homesick or lonely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;King James will be a lucky man to have such a contented bride.&#x201d;<br> <br>That is the closest I get to warning him that Katherine of Aragon is looking down her long Spanish nose at us. But I nickname her Katherine of Arrogant and Mary hears me say it, since she is everywhere, always eavesdropping on her elders and betters. She catches it up, and it makes me laugh every time I hear her and see my mother&#x2019;s quick frown and quiet correction.<br> <br><br> <br>The wedding passes off very brilliantly, arranged by my lady grandmother, of course, to show the world just how wealthy and grand we are now. Father has spent a fortune on a week of jousting and celebration and feasting, the fountains flow with wine, they roast oxen in Smithfield Market, and the people tear up the wedding carpet so that they can all have a little piece of Tudor glory on their sideboards. This is my first chance to see a royal wedding and I inspect the bride from the top of her beautiful white lace headdress, which they call a mantilla, to the heels of her embroidered shoes.<br> <br>She looks pretty, I cannot deny that, but there is no cause for everyone to behave as if she is a miracle of beauty. Her long hair is the color of gold and brass, and falls around her shoulders nearly to her waist. She is as dainty as a little picture, which makes me feel awkward, as if my feet and hands are too big. It would be petty and a sin to think badly of her because of this, but I admit to myself that it will be better for everyone when she conceives a son and a Tudor heir, disappears into confinement for months, and comes out fat.<br> <br>As soon as the feast is over, the double doors at the end of the h...</p><h2>Guide to Concrete: Masonry &amp; Stucco Projects (Quikrete)</h2><p><p><b>Concrete information for long-lasting concrete projects</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This book is an all-new hardworking visual guide to the most popular home concrete and masonry projects, endorsed by the biggest manufacturer of concrete products in North America.

Author of eco-classics such as <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i> and <i>Desert Solitaire</i>, Edward Abbey reveals all his rough-hewn edges and passionate beliefs in this witty, outspoken, maddening, and sometimes brilliant selection of journal entries that takes the writer from his early years as a park ranger and would-be literary author up to his death in 1989.Beatnik turned major American essayist, ecologist in advance of the modern ecological movement, anarchist "in favor of settling the African problem by violent revolution, if at all possible," and self-proclaimed Communist, Abbey is both compelling and infuriating, more so in his essays than the fiction he considered his serious work. His journals show that he didn't so much find a voice as mature the one he always had. He gradually replaces his schematic ideas for novels, which inundated him, with observations and narratives. He lusts after anything in skirts, marries one woman after another, is ebullient at the birth of his first child, more reserved about the second. He responds insightfully to some of his colleagues--he was the first on his block to praise Allen Ginsberg--invidiously to others: "John Irving on the cover of <i>Time</i> (September '81). That magazine never fails to bestow its blessings on the mediocre." A must for every library with serious holdings in the literature of the Southwest; others may find perhaps too much juvenilia in it. Then again, it's Ed Abbey. <i>Roland Wulbert</i></p><h2>The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention</h2><p>This title offers a captivating look at the unparalleled achievements of ancient China later adopted by the West. From the suspension bridge to the decimal system, China&#39;s contributions in engineering, medicine, maths, science, warfare, transportation and music helped inspire the West&#39;s agricultural and industrial revolutions. Based on the immense scholarship of the late Dr. Joseph Needham - the world&#39;s foremost sinologist - Robert Temple now captures the spirit and excitement of centuries of ingenuity in this highly accessible, lavishly illustrated volume.</p><p>It is one of the ironies of history that the Chinese, who had all the ingredients for modern science long before the Renaissance, failed to build on their immense knowledge. Today, very few people are aware of the vast body of Chinese invention. The suspension bridge, the fishing reel, the stirrup, the parachute, paper money, playing cards, the decimal system, the seismograph, negative numbers, brandy, rudders, cranks, movable type, matches, steroids as drugs, propellers, biological pest control&#x2014;all these and many more were Chinese inventions. Based on the peerless scholarship of Dr. Joseph Needham, the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on Chinese science, this volume traces the stunning achievements of ancient and medieval China.<br> SCIENCE / CHINA<br><br> Many of the world&#x2019;s greatest inventions have their foundation in ancient China.

Questioning those who view Impressionism solely in terms of artistic technique, T. J. Clark describes the painting of Manet, Degas, Seurat, and others as an attempt to give form to that modernity and seek out its typical representatives -- be they bar-maids, boaters, prostitutes, sightseers, or petits bourgeois lunching on the grass. The central question of The Painting of Modern Life is this: did modern painting as it came into being celebrate the consumer-oriented culture of the Paris of Napoleon III or open it to critical scrutiny? The revised edition of this classic book includes a new preface by the author.<b>T. J.

This is none of Ireland&#x2019;s subtle seasons mixed for a connoisseur&#x2019;s palate, watercolor nuances within a pinch-sized range of cloud and soft rain; this is summer full-throated and extravagant in a hot pure silkscreen blue. This summer explodes on your tongue tasting of chewed blades of long grass, your own clean sweat, Marie biscuits with butter squirting through the holes and shaken bottles of red lemonade picnicked in tree houses. It tingles on your skin with BMX wind in your face, ladybug feet up your arm; it packs every breath full of mown grass and billowing wash lines; it chimes and fountains with birdcalls, bees, leaves and football-bounces and skipping-chants, One! two! three! This summer will never end. It starts every day with a shower of Mr. Whippy notes and your best friend&#x2019;s knock at the door, finishes it with long slow twilight and mothers silhouetted in doorways calling you to come in, through the bats shrilling among the black lace trees. This is Everysummer decked in all its best glory.</p><p>Picture an orderly little maze of houses on a hill, only a few miles from Dublin. Someday, the government declared, this will be a buzzing marvel of suburban vitality, a plan-perfect solution to overcrowding and poverty and every urban ill; for now it is a few handfuls of cloned semi-detacheds, still new enough to look startled and gauche on their hillside. While the government rhapsodized about McDonald&#x2019;s and multiscreens, a few young families&#x2014;escaping from the tenements and outdoor toilets that went unmentioned in 1970s Ireland, or dreaming big back gardens and hopscotch roads for their children, or just buying as close to home as a teacher&#x2019;s or bus driver&#x2019;s salary would let them&#x2014;packed rubbish bags and bumped along a two-track path, grass and daisies growing down the middle, to their mint-new start.</p><p>That was ten years ago, and the vague strobe-light dazzle of chain stores and community centers conjured up under &#x201c;infrastructure&#x201d; has so far failed to materialize (minor politicians occasionally bellow in the D�il, unreported, about shady land deals). Farmers still pasture cows across the road, and night flicks on only a sparse constellation of lights on the neighboring hillsides; behind the estate, where the someday plans show the shopping center and the neat little park, spreads a square mile and who knows how many centuries of wood.</p><p>Move closer, follow the three children scrambling over the thin membrane of brick and mortar that holds the wood back from the semi-ds. Their bodies have the perfect economy of latency; they are streamlined and unselfconscious, pared to light flying machines. White tattoos&#x2014;lightning bolt, star, A&#x2014;flash where they cut Band-Aids into shapes and let the sun brown around them. A flag of white-blond hair flies out: toehold, knee on the wall, up and over and gone.</p><p>The wood is all flicker and murmur and illusion. Its silence is a pointillist conspiracy of a million tiny noises&#x2014;rustles, flurries, nameless truncated shrieks; its emptiness teems with secret life, scurrying just beyond the corner of your eye. Careful: bees zip in and out of cracks in the leaning oak; stop to turn any stone and strange larvae will wriggle irritably, while an earnest thread of ants twines up your ankle. In the ruined tower, someone&#x2019;s abandoned stronghold, nettles thick as your wrist seize between the stones, and at dawn rabbits bring their kittens out from the foundations to play on ancient graves.</p><p>These three children own the summer. They know the wood as surely as they know the microlandscapes of their own grazed knees; put them down blindfolded in any dell or clearing and they could find their way out without putting a foot wrong. This is their territory, and they rule it wild and lordly as young animals; they scramble through its trees and hide-and-seek in its hollows all the endless day long, and all night in their dreams.</p><p>They are running into legend, into sleepover stories and nightmares parents never hear. Down the faint lost paths you would never find alone, skidding round the tumbled stone walls, they stream calls and shoelaces behind them like comet-trails. And who is it waiting on the riverbank with his hands in the willow branches, whose laughter tumbles swaying from a branch high above, whose is the face in the undergrowth in the corner of your eye, built of light and leaf-shadow, there and gone in a blink?</p><p>These children will not be coming of age, this or any other summer. This August will not ask them to find hidden reserves of strength and courage as they confront the complexity of the adult world and come away sadder and wiser and bonded for life. This summer has other requirements for them.<br><br><b>1</b></p><p>What I warn you to remember is that I am a detective. Our relationship with truth is fundamental but cracked, refracting confusingly like fragmented glass. It is the core of our careers, the endgame of every move we make, and we pursue it with strategies painstakingly constructed of lies and concealment and every variation on deception. The truth is the most desirable woman in the world and we are the most jealous lovers, reflexively denying anyone else the slightest glimpse of her. We betray her routinely, spending hours and days stupor-deep in lies, and then turn back to her holding out the lover&#x2019;s ultimate M�bius strip: But I only did it because I love you so much.</p><p>I have a pretty knack for imagery, especially the cheap, facile kind. Don&#x2019;t let me fool you into seeing us as a bunch of parfit gentil knights galloping off in doublets after Lady Truth on her white palfrey. What we do is crude, crass and nasty. A girl gives her boyfriend an alibi for the evening when we suspect him of robbing a north-side Centra and stabbing the clerk. I flirt with her at first, telling her I can see why he would want to stay home when he&#x2019;s got her; she is peroxided and greasy, with the flat, stunted features of generations of malnutrition, and privately I am thinking that if I were her boyfriend I would be relieved to trade her even for a hairy cellmate named Razor. Then I tell her we&#x2019;ve found marked bills from the till in his classy white tracksuit bottoms, and he&#x2019;s claiming that she went out that evening and gave them to him when she got back.</p><p>I do it so convincingly, with such delicate crosshatching of discomfort and compassion at her man&#x2019;s betrayal, that finally her faith in four shared years disintegrates like a sand castle and through tears and snot, while her man sits with my partner in the next interview room saying nothing except &#x201c;Fuck off, I was home with Jackie,&#x201d; she tells me everything from the time he left the house to the details of his sexual shortcomings. Then I pat her gently on the shoulder and give her a tissue and a cup of tea, and a statement sheet.</p><p>This is my job, and you don&#x2019;t go into it&#x2014;or, if you do, you don&#x2019;t last&#x2014;without some natural affinity for its priorities and demands. What I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this&#x2014;two things: I crave truth. And I lie.</p><p>This is what I read in the file, the day after I made detective. I will come back to this story again and again, in any number of different ways. A poor thing, possibly, but mine own: this is the only story in the world that nobody but me will ever be able to tell.</p><p>On the afternoon of Tuesday, August 14, 1984, three children&#x2014;Germaine (&#x201c;Jamie&#x201d;) Elinor Rowan, Adam Robert Ryan and Peter Joseph Savage, all aged twelve&#x2014;were playing in the road where their houses stood, in the small County Dublin town of Knocknaree. As it was a hot, clear day, many residents were in their gardens, and numerous witnesses saw the children at various times during the afternoon, balancing along the wall at the end of the road, riding their bicycles and swinging on a tire swing.</p><p>Knocknaree was at that time very sparsely developed, and a sizable wood adjoined the estate, separated from it by a five-foot wall. Around 3:00 p.m., the three children left their bicycles in the Savages&#x2019; front garden, telling Mrs. Angela Savage&#x2014;who was in the garden hanging washing on the line&#x2014;that they were going to play in the wood. They did this often and knew that part of the wood well, so Mrs. Savage was not worried that they would become lost. Peter had a wristwatch, and she told him to be home by 6:30 for his tea. This conversation was confirmed by her next-door neighbor, Mrs. Mary Therese Corry, and several witnesses saw the children climbing over the wall at the end of the road and going into the wood.</p><p>When Peter Savage had not returned by 6:45 his mother called around to the mothers of the other two children, assuming he had gone to one of their houses. None of the children had returned. Peter Savage was normally reliable, but the parents did not at that point become worried; they assumed that the children had become absorbed in a game and forgotten to check the time. At approximately five minutes to seven, Mrs. Savage went around to the wood by the road, walked a little way in and called the children. She heard no answer and neither saw nor heard anything to indicate any person was present in the wood.</p><p>She returned home to serve tea to her husband, Mr. Joseph Savage, and their four younger children. After tea, Mr. Savage and Mr. John Ryan, Adam Ryan&#x2019;s father, went a little further into the wood, called the children and again received no response. At 8:25, when it was beginning to grow dark, the parents became seriously worried that the children might have become lost, and Miss Alicia Rowan (Germaine&#x2019;s mother, a single parent), who had a telephone, rang the police.</p><p>A search of the wood began. There was at this point some fear that the children might have run away. Miss Rowan had decided that Germaine was to go to boarding school in Dublin, remaining there during the week and returning to Knocknaree at weekends; she had been scheduled to leave two weeks later, and all three children had been very upset at the thought of being separated. However, a preliminary search of the children&#x2019;s rooms revealed that no clothing, money or personal items appeared to be missing. Germaine&#x2019;s piggy bank, in the form of a Russian doll, contained �5.85 and was intact.</p><p>At 10:20 p.m. a policeman with a torch found Adam Ryan in a densely wooded area near the center of the wood, standing with his back and palms pressed against a large oak tree. His fingernails were digging into the trunk so deeply that they had broken off in the bark. He appeared to have been there for some time but had not responded to the searchers&#x2019; calling. He was taken to hospital. The Dog Unit was called in and tracked the two missing children to a point not far from where Adam Ryan had been found; there the dogs became confused and lost the scent.</p><p>When I was found I was wearing blue denim shorts, a white cotton T-shirt, white cotton socks and white lace-up running shoes. The shoes were heavily bloodstained, the socks less heavily. Later analysis of the staining patterns showed that the blood had soaked through the shoes from the inside outwards; it had soaked through the socks, in lesser concentrations, from the outside in. The implication was that the shoes had been removed and blood had spilled into them; some time later, when it had begun to coagulate, the shoes had been replaced on my feet, thus transferring blood to the socks. The T-shirt showed four parallel tears, between three and five inches in length, running diagonally across the back from the mid-left shoulder blade to the right back ribs.</p><p>I was uninjured except for some minor scratches on my calves, splinters (later found to be consistent with the wood of the oak tree) under my fingernails, and a deep abrasion on each kneecap, both beginning to form scabs. There was some uncertainty as to whether the grazes had been made in the wood or not, as a younger child (Aideen Watkins, aged five) who had been playing in the road stated that she had seen me fall from a wall earlier that day, landing on my knees. However, her statement varied with retelling and was not considered reliable. I was also near-catatonic: I made no voluntary movement for almost thirty-six hours and did not speak for a further two weeks. When I did, I had no memory of anything between leaving home that afternoon and being examined in the hospital.</p><p>The blood on my shoes and socks was tested for ABO type&#x2014;DNA analysis was not a possibility in Ireland in 1984&#x2014;and found to be type A positive. My blood was also found to be type A positive; however, it was judged to be unlikely that the abrasions on my knees, although deep, could have drawn enough blood to cause the heavy soaking in the running shoes. Germaine Rowan&#x2019;s blood had been tested prior to an appendectomy two years earlier, and her records showed that she was also A positive. Peter Savage, though no blood type was on record for him, was eliminated as the source of the stains: both his parents were found to be type O, making it impossible that he could be anything else. In the absence of conclusive identification, investigators could not eliminate the possibility that the blood had come from a fourth individual, nor the possibility that it originated from multiple sources.</p><p>The search continued throughout the night of August 14 and for weeks thereafter&#x2014;teams of volunteers combed the nearby fields and hills, every known bog hole and bog drain in the area was explored, divers searched the river that ran through the wood&#x2014;with no result. Fourteen months later, Mr. Andrew Raftery, a local resident walking his dog in the wood, spotted a wristwatch in the undergrowth about two hundred feet from the tree where I had been found. The watch was distinctive&#x2014;the face showed a cartoon of a footballer in action, and the second-hand was tipped with a football&#x2014;and Mr. and Mrs. Savage identified it as having belonged to their son Peter. Mrs. Savage confirmed that he had been wearing it on the afternoon of his disappearance. The watch&#x2019;s plastic strap appeared to have been torn from the metal face with some force, possibly by catching on a low branch when Peter was running. The Technical Bureau identified a number of partial fingerprints on the strap and face; all were consistent with prints found on Peter Savage&#x2019;s belongings.</p><p>Despite numerous police appeals and a high-profile media campaign, no other trace of Peter Savage and Germaine Rowan was ever found.</p><p>I became a policeman because I wanted to be a Murder detective. My time in training and in uniform&#x2014;Templemore College, endless complicated physical exercises, wandering around small towns in a cartoonish Day-Glo jacket, investigating which of the three unintelligible local delinquents had broken Mrs. McSweeney&#x2019;s garden-shed window&#x2014;all felt like an embarrassing daze scripted by Ionesco, a trial by tedium I had to endure, for some dislocated bureaucratic reason, in order to earn my actual job. I never think about those years and cannot remember them with any clarity. I made no friends; to me my detachment from the whole process felt involuntary and inevitable, like the side effect of a sedative drug, but the other cops read it as deliberate superciliousness, a studied sneer at their solid rural backgrounds and solid rural ambitions. Possibly it was.

Many inhabit small-town or suburban America. But this time, her heroine is urban: a brainy, beautiful, and ambitious rising star of 1970s television. Dena Nordstrom, pride of the network, is a woman whose future is full of promise, her present rich with complications, and her past marked by mystery.<br><br>Among the colorful cast of characters are:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sookie, of Selma, Alabama, Dena's exuberant&nbsp;&nbsp;college roommate, who is everything that Dena&nbsp;&nbsp;is not; she is thrilled by Dena's success and will&nbsp;&nbsp;do everything short of signing autographs for&nbsp;&nbsp;her; Sookie's a mom, a wife, and a Kappa forever<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dena's cousins, the Warrens, and her aunt Elner,&nbsp;&nbsp;of Elmwood Springs, Missouri, endearing, loyal,&nbsp;&nbsp;talkative, ditsy, and, in their way, wise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbor Dorothy, whose spirit hovers over them&nbsp;&nbsp;all through the radio show that she broadcast&nbsp;&nbsp;from her home in the 1940s<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sidney Capello, pioneer of modern sleaze journalism and privateer of privacy, and Ira Wallace,&nbsp;&nbsp;his partner in tabloid television<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several doctors, all of them taken with--and&nbsp;&nbsp;almost taken in by-Dena<br><br>There are others, captivated by a woman who tries to go home again, not knowing where home or love lie.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>With home-cooked, Southern literary flair, Fannie Flagg (<i>Fried Green Tomatoes</i>) returns with <i>Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!</i> "Baby Girl," as she is lovingly referred to by her sweet, country cousins, is Dena Nordstrom, a tall, blonde, corn-fed girl who makes it big in Manhattan. Ms. Nordstrom is now the top TV anchorwoman in the city, beating out veteran journalists and making ungodly amounts of money. Although her life seems charmed, Dena is frazzled and miserable. She drinks uncontrollably, is a borderline compulsive liar, and is forced to undergo therapy because of her stress-induced ulcer. Her psychiatrist, Dr. O'Malley, falls madly in love with her, of course, and sends the blonde bombshell to a close colleague, Dr. Diggers. Living up to her name, Diggers shovels up a mountain of dysfunction and forces Dena to face her mysterious past; all the while the good doctor reports back to brokenhearted O'Malley about her patient's progress. Meanwhile, back at the station, Ms. Nordstrom has made friends and enemies in very high places. Her greatest ally is Howard Kingsley, the Cronkitesque reporter who wields power with more ease than most seasoned politicos: "He closed the door and handed the driver a ten-dollar bill. 'Take this young lady where she wants to go for me, will you? And be careful, she's valuable property.'" It's a good thing she has friends like that, because her boss, Ira Wallace, makes George Costanza from <i>Seinfeld</i> look like a scrupulous saint. When Wallace hires a nasty but effective mole by the name of Sidney Capello to dig up garbage on celebrities, Nordstrom has a head-on collision with his sense of ethics (or lack thereof) and gets Capello canned. Or so she thinks. <i>Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!</i> is very much like its star, Dena Nordstrom: pretty, scattered, confused, and sometimes interesting. It's a long ride from the Whistle Stop Cafe, and readers who enjoy Jan Karon's Mitford Fall series will most likely be the biggest fans of Flagg's third novel.12 cds</p><h2>Betty Crocker&#39;s Kitchen Gardens (The Betty Crocker home library)</h2><p>This is a book for the gardener who loves to cook and for a cook who loves to garden!

It builds on earlier researches into priesthood, and into the murmuring motif as exhibited primarily in the books of Exodus and Numbers,&#x201d; begins the author in his preface. He goes on to explain, &#x201c;. . . this book gathers together some of the relevant scholarly discussion pertaining to the book of Numbers, and . . . in certain respects it offers new ways of arranging the pieces, of looking at the background of the book, and at the possibilities of interpretation.&#x201d;</p><p>In this commentary, Dr. Philip Budd divides the book of Numbers into three sections:</p><ul> <li>Constituting the community at Sinai (1:1&#x2013;9:14)</li> <li>The journey&#x2015;its setbacks and success (9:15&#x2013;25:18)</li> <li>Final preparations for settlement (26:1&#x2013;35:34)</li></ul><p>From this outline it becomes apparent that the book of Numbers accounts for that period of Israelite history known as the &#x201c;wilderness wanderings,&#x201d; which begins with the flight from Egypt and closes with the Israelites&#x2019; successful entry into the Promised Land. Here are explanations of the origins of Levitical priesthood, of Israel&#x2019;s holy feasts, of the sobering results of rebellion against God, of the minutiae of the law, and of the blessings promised those who, like Caleb and Joshua, can &#x201c;spy out the land,&#x201d; assess its giants, and still live by faith. </p><p>While some modern readers feel distance from the Jewish laws for lepers, or the dietary requirements laid down in these writings, Dr. Budd shows the formative influence such material had in transforming the sons of Abraham into the nation of Israel.</p><p>Dr. Budd&#x2019;s treatment gives due respect to the present canonical state of the text, while inquiring also into the forms in which much of this material must have been originally cast. His comments provide authoritative illumination of this important period in Old Testament history. </p></p><p><p>Philip J.

Postman presents useful models with which schools can restore a sense of purpose, tolerance, and a respect for learning.</p><p>Neil Postman is University Professor and Chair of the Department of Culture and Communication at New York University.One of the best writers among contemporary cultural critics, Postman is never better than when writing about education. His Janus-faced title refers both to the idea that schools as we know them are on the way out and to his own perception that American schools need new reasons--<i>ends</i> for learning. He calls such reasons "gods" --cultural conceits intended to inspire students to learn. He critiques gods that are failing in today's schools, such as the god of economic utility, in whose name students are supposed to believe that if they get through school halfway well, they will then get a well-paying job, and the god of consumership, whose golden rule is: The one who dies owning the most toys wins. He then proposes five new gods to make schooling vital again. He calls the five "The Spaceship Earth," "The Fallen Angel," "The American Experiment," "The Law of Diversity," and "The Word Weavers/The World Makers." If each of these rubrics has the ring of a familiar belief system, well, each is meant to. As Postman defines the five, they are myths, in the most complimentary sense of the word, for realizing ourselves as responsible individuals in our communities, from smallest to largest. Beautifully written, breathtakingly high-minded, this is Postman's best book on American education. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The New Lifetime Reading Plan</h2><p>Now in print for the first time in almost 40 years, The New Lifetime Reading Plan provides readers with brief, informative and entertaining introductions to more than 130 classics of world literature. From Homer to Hawthorne, Plato to Pascal, and Shakespeare to Solzhenitsyn, the great writers of Western civilization can be found in its pages. In addition, this new edition offers a much broader representation of women authors, such as Charlotte Bront%, Emily Dickinson and Edith Wharton, as well as non-Western writers such as Confucius, Sun-Tzu, Chinua Achebe, Mishima Yukio and many others. This fourth edition also features a simpler format that arranges the works chronologically in five sections (The Ancient World; 300-1600; 1600-1800; and The 20th Century), making them easier to look up than ever before. It deserves a place in the libraries of all lovers of literature.</p><p>In print for almost 40 years, <i>The Lifetime Reading Plan</i> has long been a worthy addition to any serious reader's bookshelf, providing entertaining and informative introductions to the great works of Western civilization. Now, this "classic about classics" has been updated to reflect more diverse traditions. <i>The New Lifetime Reading Plan</i> recommends great literature from around the globe, including writers and works from Confucius to Chinua Achebe, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez to the Koran. Also new is an appendix profiling books by 100 important 20th-century authors--or "temporary classics," as coauthor John S. Major calls them.<p>Readers may argue with some of the selections (or, more likely, the omissions). Others may quarrel with the editors' opinions; they routinely analyze artists' "characters,"with occasionally prissy or patronizing results. (Of Walt Whitman, for instance, coauthor Clifton Fadiman declares that "He had an original temperament, a certain peasant shrewdness, but only a moderate amount of brains.") But no one can argue with the book's mission: promoting the classics as "life companions." "Once part of you, they work in and on and with you until you die," Fadiman writes in the introduction. Anyone seeking a guide to the vast riches of world literature need look no further than the <i>The New Lifetime Reading Plan</i>; it provides a gateway to the greatest achievements of the human mind.</p>Clifton Fadiman (1904-1999) was a well-known American author, editor, public intellectual, and radio and television personality.</p><h2>Philothea, or an Introduction to the Devout Life</h2><p>Francis de Sales s <b>Introduction to the Devout Life</b><i> </i>has remained a uniquely accessible and relevant treasure of devotion for nearly four hundred years.

Her hilarious and deeply relatable look at the challenges of womanhood in a changing world became a cultural touchstone for women everywhere. Now Guisewite returns with her signature wit and warmth in this debut essay collection about another time of big transition, when everything starts changing and disappearing without permission: aging parents, aging children, aging self stuck in the middle. <br><br>With her uniquely wry and funny admissions and insights, Guisewite unearths the humor and horror of everything from the mundane (trying to introduce her parents to TiVo and facing four decades' worth of unorganized photos) to the profound (finding a purpose post-retirement, helping parents downsize their lives, and declaring freedrom from all those things that hold us back). No longer confined to the limits of four comic panels, Guisewite holds out her hand in prose form and becomes a reassuring companion for those on the threshold of "what happens next." Heartfelt and humane and always cathartic, <i>Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault </i>is ideal reading for mothers, daughters, and anyone who is caught somewhere in between.</p><p><b>Cathy Guisewite</b> is the creator of the "Cathy" comic strip, which ran in nearly 1,400 newspapers for thirty-four years.

Worse than the go-everywhere black dress upon which I spent a car payment in my forties that never went anywhere because the only time I ever got it zipped was five minutes before handing my Visa card to the hip L.A. salesperson who told me how hot I looked in it.</p><p>This is worse than all that. This is my whole life not fitting. My days are too short, my lists are too long. People aren&#x2019;t where they&#x2019;re supposed to be. Everything&#x2019;s changing without my permission. Children are moving away, friends moving on, loved ones leaving the earth, muscles and skin tone not even pausing to wave farewell before deserting me&#x2014;and after all I&#x2019;ve done for them. Just when I think I can&#x2019;t possibly stand one more goodbye, something or someone I thought would be here forever isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Everyone I know is in some version of a great big life shift. Right in the middle of people and things that are changing and disappearing way too fast. An unrequested rearrangement of everything in our personal worlds&#x2014;as if there isn&#x2019;t enough that feels out of our control right now in the big world. It&#x2019;s unsettling and unnerving. And scary. Impossible to be everything to everyone, to reconcile all that&#x2019;s different, and to keep track of ourselves along that way.</p><p>I grip the trash bag. I have an overwhelming, exhilarating need to get rid of things before any more leave on their own.</p><p>I stopped my life&#x2019;s work of drawing a comic strip after thirty-four years when the first rumbles of big change in my own life made it impossible for me to hold the pen. My daughter was starting her senior year of high school and I panicked that her childhood was ending before I&#x2019;d had a chance to be a mom. I wanted, for once in my life, to get to be a full-time mom like the new stay-at-home superstar moms I read about in magazines and also, if I&#x2019;m completely honest, like the old-school housewife moms I watched on TV when I was growing up. I wanted to get to feel what it was like to make tomato soup in the middle of the day.</p><p>That same year, my parents were both approaching their nineties, and I also wanted, for once in my life, to get to be a full-time adult daughter like the patient, loving daughters I read about in books. Graciously, selflessly helping Mom and Dad glide into their twilight years.</p><p>None of this has gone as planned.</p><p>I became a full-time mom at the very moment my daughter decided to reject all input from anyone over age thirty.</p><p>I became a full-time daughter the moment my parents announced they would barricade the front door if I tried to bring in anyone or anything to assist them.</p><p>I got older, which I hadn&#x2019;t factored in, and became even more obnoxious and belligerent than my child or my parents, incapable of even committing to exercising five minutes a day.</p><p>I thought that when I quit my job, the pace of all the change would slow down. But it didn&#x2019;t. It sped up. Before I knew it, the year zoomed by, my daughter turned nineteen and moved to college, my parents turned ninety, and I turned into a bicoastal hoverer. Commuting between generations. Back and forth between Florida and California so often now, I spend the first few minutes of each morning trying to guess which coast I&#x2019;m on before I open my eyes.</p><p>Which is why I&#x2019;m standing here right now. Trash bag held high. I can control nothing else, but I can control this. I will stuff life as I knew it into this bag and get rid of it. All of it.</p><p>The delusional clothes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the useless beauty products&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the plastic food containers with no lids. I will move on to the file cabinets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the bathroom cupboard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the storage room. I will shred and dump! Delete! Declutter! I will be a role model of clarity. I will do it for my family. I will do it for me. Create a future with absolutely nothing hot pink and strappy holding me back.</p><p>I open the garbage bag to stuff in my first triumphant &#x201c;OUT!&#x201d;</p><p>I reach into the closet and pull out a frayed T-shirt I haven&#x2019;t worn since 1982.</p><p>I study it in my hand.</p><p>I think how cute it would look paired with an oversize linen shirt, beaded belt, and suede ankle boots. I remember seeing a kicky messenger bag online somewhere with tassels the exact same shade of teal as the faded flower logo on the right sleeve.</p><p>I refold the shirt and lay it back on the shelf.</p><p>I close the garbage bag.</p><p>I march into the kitchen and sit at the table. So many thoughts are stacking up in my head. Big changes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. little tassels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hanging on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. letting go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I open my laptop to start typing.</p><p>Before I can unload the closets, I have to get rid of some of these words.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.</p><p>Fifty Things That Aren&#x2019;t My Fault</p><p>Am I allowed to eat a noodle? I stare at the menu on the wall behind the takeout counter and try to remember. </p><p>It used to be so simple.</p><p>Noodles were good because they were comfort food.</p><p>Then noodles were bad because they were fattening.</p><p>Then noodles were good because they were &#x201c;pasta.&#x201d;</p><p>Then noodles were bad because they were carbohydrates.</p><p>Then noodles were good because they were fiber.</p><p>Then noodles were bad because they were gluten.</p><p>Then noodles were good because they were &#x201c;pho.&#x201d;</p><p>Then noodles were bad because they were high glycemic.</p><p>Then noodles were good because they were comfort food.</p><p>Then what? I have six months of unread healthy-lifestyle magazines on my kitchen counter, which puts me six months behind on where the noodle stands.</p><p>Paralyzed at the takeout window.</p><p>I turn to the line of impatient people behind me and blurt out the one and only thing I am completely sure of at this moment in my grown-up life:</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault!&#x201d;</p><p>Decades of fighting for emancipation from all sorts of things, and this is possibly the most liberating moment of all. I repeat it with more volume in case the irritated people toward the back of the line didn&#x2019;t hear. Also, honestly, I just want to feel the words come out of my mouth again.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault!&#x201d;</p><p>The man behind me sighs, loud and exasperated. I turn and look him in the eye. Right in his scowling, unadorned male eye. Not one moment of his morning was spent on eyeliner like mine was, I note. No eye shadow, no mascara, no fine-line filler, no under-eye concealer. I look further. No eyebrow shaping no eyebrow tinting no pore minimizer no foundation no bronzer no blush no Botox no blow-dry no straightener no curling iron no root dye no wispy layers no highlights no ear jewelry chosen to match his outfit.</p><p>I stop at his neck. No need to move on to his outfit. In four seconds, I&#x2019;ve already calculated that if I add up the hours, days, weeks, and years of his life starting from when he didn&#x2019;t play dress-up at age three like I did until this moment in this line at this takeout counter, he&#x2019;s had approximately eighteen thousand extra hours of time on earth to do all sorts of things that I haven&#x2019;t. All of that is also not my fault.</p><p>&#x201c;IT&#x2019;S NOT MY FAULT!&#x201d; I proclaim even louder, right at his non-lip-lined, non-lipsticked, non-lip-plumped lips.</p><p>He glares and takes a step backward. I turn back to the cashier, place a non-noodle order, and strut down the counter to pay.</p><p>Life is just different for girls.</p><p>Life is more time consuming.</p><p>Life is more complicated.</p><p>Life is overflowing with expectations and obligations that use up our time, energy, and spirit and leave us feeling exhausted, insecure, and alone.</p><p>And I Have Had It.</p><p>I dig through my ten-pound purse for my two-pound wallet.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not my fault that my wallet contains one credit card and nineteen bonus club cards to stores in which I could get a discount if I could ever find the card.</p><p>Not my fault I have to carry the bonus club cards in my wallet because I didn&#x2019;t get my phone number registered to the accounts.</p><p>Not my fault that when I try to register my phone number to the accounts, I&#x2019;m told my user name already has a membership associated with it and that I have to enter the password, which I don&#x2019;t remember and didn&#x2019;t write down for fear of identity theft.</p><p>Not my fault that I haven&#x2019;t reset my passwords, because that would involve checking my email to get the reset codes, and when I check my email, I have to face the little bold print on the upper right of the screen that says I have 7038 emails I haven&#x2019;t answered.</p><p>The disgruntled gentleman who was behind me in the ordering line is now behind me in the paying line. I feel his eyes boring into me, his ungroomed eyebrows raised at the spectacle of the insides of my wallet and purse, which are dumped on the Pay Here counter. Again, I slowly turn to face him. His flat one-ounce, bonus-club-card-free wallet is gripped in his unmanicured fingers like a manly badge of superiority. Membership badge to a detail-free club to which a girl will never belong.</p><p>&#x201c;IT&#x2019;S NOT MY FAULT!!&#x201d; I roar.</p><p>I drive home with the windows of self-righteousness wide open. I breathe in the possibility of innocence. Big, freeing gulps of it. I barrel past mini-mall eateries and jammed parking lots, a Los Angeles suburb full of people hungry for dinner and a taste of what just happened to me in the takeout line.</p><p>What just happened was the opposite of who I am.</p><p>I am from Dayton, Ohio, and Midland, Michigan: I apologize for holding up lines. I don&#x2019;t scream in public or at strangers.</p><p>I am my mother&#x2019;s daughter: I take personal responsibility for everything and everyone on the planet. I look for those I can help, not those I can blame.</p><p>I am a member of my generation: I proudly own all my life choices.</p><p>I&#x2019;m of all that&#x2014;the Midwest&#x2019;s gracious values plus Mom&#x2019;s deep sense of responsibility plus my generation&#x2019;s triumphant empowerment. I&#x2019;m courteous, compassionate, and personally accountable for every speck of everything.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>&#x201c;IT&#x2019;S NOT MY FAULT I WAS RAISED TO THINK EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT!&#x201d; I yell out my wide-open window.</p><p>Hah!</p><p>I barrel down the road toward home, indignation rising up in me, soaring, pouring out of me like lyrics of the perfect songs I can never find on the car radio.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault I can never find songs on the car radio because I haven&#x2019;t had three hours to learn how to program the simplified digitized car radio menu screen!&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m on fire.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault I just paid someone to make me a sandwich because it&#x2019;s become too complicated to buy a loaf of bread!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault I drove to the takeout place in sweat pants because all my blue jeans hurt!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault the sweat pants also hurt because someone decided women&#x2019;s workout wear should be clingy and sexy to show off the hot &#x2018;after&#x2019; body, not the non-hot, actually-needs-to-work-out &#x2018;before&#x2019; body!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault that women&#x2019;s magazines have covers declaring we should embrace our beautiful natural curves, and sixteen articles inside on how to get skinny&#x2014;and that even if I&#x2019;m over it, I still need to spend hours and hours navigating the hypocrisy for my daughter!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault I can&#x2019;t call my daughter on the $700 phone I bought her to discuss it because &#x2018;voice is over&#x2019;!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault that the man behind me at the takeout place will never understand because he never had to navigate any of the body issue contradictions for himself or his son!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault I&#x2019;m thinking about that man again!&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s all right there as I scan the memory of him and imagine the different universes in which he and I live.

All the pants in a man&#x2019;s closet are the same length because all the heels of their shoes are the same height. Men don&#x2019;t spend one speck of their lives deciding how tall they&#x2019;ll be before they commit to buying or hemming their pants. They don&#x2019;t need six different styles of black pants in four different lengths to go with nine different heel heights of black shoes for fourteen different types of occasions.</p><p>Men are the same shape all day. They don&#x2019;t need to decide which direction to mold which body parts before they put on clothes.</p><p>Men are the same age all day.

Ditto shoes. Ditto workout wear.</p><p>Ditto the worst of the worst&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>When a man needs a swimsuit, he simply grabs trunks his size off the rack.

Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and not yet afflicted with polio), attending the laying of the keel of the <i>USS Arizona</i> at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Writing with vivid intimacy, Nelson traces Japan&#x2019;s leaders as they lurch into ultranationalist fascism, which culminates in their insanely daring yet militarily brilliant scheme to terrify America with one of the boldest attacks ever waged. Within seconds, the country would never be the same.<br> <br>In addition to learning the little understood history of how and why Japan attacked Hawaii, we hear an abandoned record player endlessly repeating &#x201c;Sunrise Serenade&#x201d; as bombs shatter the decks of the <i>California</i>; we feel cold terror as lanky young American sailors must anxiously choose between staying aboard their sinking ships or diving overboard into harbor waters aflame with burning ship fuel; we watch as Navy wives tearfully hide with their children in caves from a rumored invasion, and we understand the frustration and triumph of a lone American teenager as he shoots down a Japanese bomber, even as the attack destroys hundreds of US airplanes and dozens of ships.<br> <br>Backed by a research team&#x2019;s five years of work, which produced nearly a million pages of documents, as well as Nelson&#x2019;s thorough re-examination of the original evidence assembled by federal investigators, this page-turning and definitive work provides a thrilling blow-by-blow account from both the Japanese and American perspectives, and is historical drama on the grandest scale. Nelson delivers all the terror, chaos, violence, tragedy, and heroism of the attack in stunning detail, and offers surprising conclusions about the tragedy&#x2019;s unforeseen and resonant consequences that linger even today.</p><p>Craig Nelson&nbsp;is the author of <i>Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon, </i>as well as several previous books, including <i>The Age of Radiance </i>(a PEN Award Finalist chosen as one of the year&#x2019;s best books by NBC News, the American Institute of Physics, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, and FlavorWire), <i>The First Heroes, Thomas Paine </i>(winner of the Henry Adams Prize), and <i>Let&#x2019;s Get Lost</i> (shortlisted for W.H. Smith&#x2019;s Book of the Year). His writing has appeared in <i>Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, Salon, National Geographic, The New England Review, Popular Science, Reader&#x2019;s Digest,</i> and a host of other publications.&#x201c;In this brilliant mix of history and emotion, Craig Nelson has managed to combine grueling research with masterful reporting in order to capture the long and the short, the overview and the detail, of that infamous day in a paradisal land of orchids and jacaranda. It has taken seventy-five years, but now, finally, <i>the</i> Pearl Harbor book has been written.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jim deFilippi, author of <i>Mules of Monte Cassino</i> and <i>Murka</i></b><br><br>"Craig Nelson has completely retold the epic story of Pearl Harbor. Using his skills as a reporter and a literary stylist, he not only deftly paints the fleeting image&#x2014;an enemy pilot waving as he flies by, a cup of coffee trembling on a table while outside a war commences&#x2014;but a world roiled in titanic struggle. His gifts as storyteller, his empathy and scope, will appeal to fans of Walter Lord&#x2019;s <i>Day of Infamy</i> or Cornelius Ryan&#x2019;s <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>, and, in surprise, the inquiry of Lawrence Wright&#x2019;s <i>The Looming Tower</i>. This book has a thousand poignant and unforgettable moments.

New York Times bestselling author Charles Todd takes readers into Scotland Yard detective Ian Rutledge's past-to his perplexing final case before the outbreak of World War I. On a fine summer's day in June, 1914, Ian Rutledge pays little notice to the assassination of an archduke in Sarajevo. An Inspector at Scotland Yard, he is planning to propose to the woman whom he deeply loves, despite intimations from friends and family that she may not be the wisest choice. To the north on this warm and gentle day, another man in love-a Scottish Highlander-shows his own dear girl the house he will build for her in September. While back in England, a son awaits the undertaker in the wake of his widowed mother's death.

It features virtually all of the operas that are being performed in the foremost opera houses and concert halls today. The text is presented in its original language as well as in an English translation. To enrich the experience, a short synopsis precedes each libretto. 101 Opera Librettos is indispensable for opera lovers and everyone curious about the literary richness of the worlds most beloved vocal musical performances.</p><p>You're never going to haul this book to the opera house, it is true, but, on the other hand, you'll probably never again have to fret over where to find a libretto for most standard repertory operas. This massive, 1,474-page (plus endpapers) volume, which could readily double as a doorstop or a booster seat at the theater, contains all the words, in their original languages (for the most part) and in English, of 101 out-of-copyright operas. The selections run the gamut from Ludwig van Beethoven's <i>Fidelio</i> through Carl Maria von Weber's <i>Euryanthe</i>, with scores of stories in between. In addition to the word-for-word libretti, a brief pr�cis of each plot is also provided. <p> There are some puzzling omissions--Mozart's <i>Cos� fan tutte</i> and <i>Abduction from the Seraglio</i>--and puzzling inclusions as well: Paderewski's <i>Manru</i> and Horatio Parker's <i>Mona</i> are not considered standard operas by any authority that readily springs to mind. Borodin's <i>Prince Igor</i> is, incomprehensibly, given in Italian and English (the Russian people improbably sing, "Ad Igor, signor nostro, vittoria"), as are Mussorgsky's <i>Boris Godunov</i> and Tchaikovsky's <i>Evgeny Onegin</i>. There are also some annoying little errors that could have been avoided with more careful proofreading ("<i>Madam Butterfly</i>"?), and the paper used is disappointingly cheap. Still, with these caveats in mind, <i>The Book of 101 Opera Librettos</i> is a very useful book for the money, a one-stop shop for many of the operas you're likely to encounter. Just be sure to read the libretto <i>before</i> you leave for the opera house.</p>A multiple GRAMMY� nominee, pianist Allison Brewster Franzetti has received international acclaim from critics and audiences alike for her stunning virtuosity and musicality, both as a soloist and chamber musician.

Throughout the war, Atkins recruited, trained, and mentored the agents for the SOE&#x2019;s French Section, which sent more than four hundred young men and women into occupied France&#x2014;at least one hundred of whom never returned and were reported &#x201c;Missing Presumed Dead&#x201d; after the war. Twelve of these were women and among Atkins&#x2019;s most cherished spies. When the war ended in 1945, she made it her personal mission to find out what happened to them and the other agents lost behind enemy lines, tracing rigorously their horrific final journeys. But as the woman who carried out this astonishing search appeared quintessentially English, Atkins was nothing of the sort. As we follow her through the devastation of postwar Germany, we learn Atkins herself covered her life in mystery so that even her closest family knew almost nothing of her past. <br><br>In <i>A Life in Secrets</i> Sarah Helm has stripped away Vera Atkins&#x2019;s many veils. Drawing on recently released sixty-year-old government files and her unprecedented access to the private papers of the Atkins family, Helm vividly reconstructs a complex and extraordinary life.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Helm</b> has been a journalist for more than twenty years. She was a reporter and feature writer on the <i>Sunday Times</i> before becoming a founding member of the <i>Independent </i>in 1986. A LIFE IN SECRETS is her first book. She lives in London, England.<b>1.<br><br>Nora</b><br>Vera Atkins did not, as a rule, take too much notice of the opinions of others. When it was a question of judging the character of a particular agent, especially a woman agent, she liked to make up her own mind in her own time--which was usually within a few moments of their entering the room where she first met them, at Orchard Court.<br><br>The flat in Orchard Court, just off Baker Street in London's West End, was a base used by SOE's French Section, or F Section, where headquarters staff could meet new recruits and also brief those departing on missions. Agents were never allowed into SOE's HQ in Baker Street in case they heard or saw something they did not need to know.<br><br>By the spring of 1943, when recruitment to F Section was fast picking up, a steady stream of young men and women would arrive at Orchard Court. The drill for new arrivals was by now well established. First, Park the doorman, in dark suit and tie, would lead the way (never asking names but always knowing exactly who a new arrival was) through the gilded gates of the lift and on up to the second floor. In perfect English or French, whichever they preferred, Park would then usher them into the flat and straight into a bathroom, because there was no space for a waiting room. "Back in the bathroom, please, sir [or madam]," he would say if they wandered out, and here the agents sat on the side of a deep, jet-black bath, or on the onyx bidet, surrounded by black and white tiles, while they waited to see what would happen next.<br><br>Park would then lead the agent to meet Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section. A tall, slender, athletic figure (he once captained Eton at soccer) with angular facial features and fair, thinning hair, Buckmaster would shake the agent's hand vigourously, then, perching momentarily on his desk, legs swinging, make a few warm welcoming remarks. To any recruit who seemed inquisitive he would say, "We don't ask questions," firmly stressing the need for secrecy at all times. He would then stride off with the recruit down the hallway and, opening another door, say, "And this is Miss Atkins."<br>Nodding towards Vera, Buckmaster would then explain, "Miss Atkins will be looking after you from now on," and as the door closed the new arrival's eyes would fall on a woman seated at a table, who produced a smile--remote but welcoming. Vera then rose, tall and trim, in twinset or tweed suit, her fair hair rolled up at the nape of her neck. This mature woman in her midthirties, most recruits assumed, must be a woman of senior rank, though exactly what rank was not at all clear as there was no uniform and she was only ever called "Madam" or "Miss Atkins."<br><br>After proffering a hand, Vera settled herself again behind a small table, showing off nicely turned ankles and smart court shoes that looked expensive but probably were not. She then slowly lit a cigarette, and her blue-grey eyes fixed upon the new recruit.<br><br>Vera appeared to know everything about the new arrival, and without referring to any piece of paper she could talk to them about their country of origin, about their family, and about their special knowledge in any field--for example, she knew if they could fire a gun, fly an aeroplane, read a map, or ski.<br><br>And Vera knew exactly where the new recruit was living, and if they needed accommodation, she would offer to arrange it. She knew of their financial circumstances as well and could offer cash advances on request up to a limited amount each month. All this was very reassuring, because until they met Miss Atkins many of these men and women had felt somewhat disoriented by the experience of "special employment," as their new work was called.<br><br>Some of the women had, just days earlier, been mopping floors at Royal Air Force (RAF) stations. Many recruits were civilians, spotted by SOE scouts, while some had just escaped across the Channel from France and had never been to England before. Few knew exactly why they had been picked out for this secret work, though it was almost certainly for little other reason than that they spoke native, or near native, French. Some were French, many had at least one French parent, and most had a cosmopolitan background.<br><br>They had been invited first for a selection interview, perhaps with a Mr. Potter, in a small, bare room numbered 055a, in the basement of the War Office. But Mr. Potter would have said little about what exactly they would be doing. Once the MI5 search into their background had safely come back indicating "no trace," they had been whisked off to sign the Official Secrets Act. But still they had no idea what it was they would be keeping secret.<br><br>Then the women went to Lilywhites to be measured for stiff new khaki serge uniforms and found themselves transformed into members of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. The FANY, as it was known, was an organisation of ladies of a certain social standing (and in many cases with fathers or husbands in the officer corps) who volunteered for military work, driving perhaps or packing parachutes. All women agents joining SOE were obliged to join the FANY to give them "cover" while in secret training, but none yet knew anything of what that training would be.<br><br>So when the door had closed behind them and they were alone, and when Miss Atkins began to talk a little about why they had been chosen from so many others for this special work, things started to make more sense. Those recruits who had clandestine experience, such as working on resistance escape lines in France, felt that Vera had some direct knowledge of what they had been through. The less experienced felt flattered that somebody as impressive and courteous as Miss Atkins was now taking time with them. It helped, for example, to be told exactly how they should explain their new position to friends and family.<br><br>A young woman recruit named Nora Inayat Khan, seconded to SOE from the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, or WAAF, had expressed particular anxiety from the start about what to tell her mother about her new secret work. Miss Atkins suggested phrases Nora might begin to use--vague hints about going away--so that her mother, to whom she was evidently close, would get used to the ties between them loosening.<br><br>And as Vera went on to explain the setup in some detail, saying how their care and training would be arranged and how she would be following their progress day by day, the agents' confidence grew.<br><br>If before the meeting closed Miss Atkins should suggest a change in their address, their appearance, or perhaps their name, naturally they did not demur. Nora Inayat Khan took the name of Nora Baker to disguise her Indian origins. Above all else the new recruits left Vera's office with an impression that Miss Atkins was in control. Some now were even excited and eager to begin. They probably felt they had learned far more about their new work than in fact they later found they had. They had certainly learnt nothing about Miss Atkins. All they knew was that she would be looking after them from now on.<br><br>***<br><br>More than fifty years later I discovered that those young men and women interviewed at Orchard Court still knew nothing about "Miss Atkins."<br><br>"My deaa booay," said the former French agent Bob Maloubier, mimicking Vera's accent. "For me everything about her was English." "Benenden and Kensington," said another, asked to guess her background. "I knew Atkins wasn't her real name," said a third. How? "I once saw something on her file."<br><br>One former staff officer, though, had caught a unique glimpse of Vera in her very earliest days. He had met her at a bridge party at exactly the time she joined SOE. "Now let's see," said Peter Lee, reading through his diary for 1941. "When was it exactly? The tenth of March. Ha! 'Played bridge--Blitz--Boodles hit--windows out of Brooks--shaking like a jelly.' I think it was round about then. It was at Elizabeth Norman's house in Thurloe Square." Elizabeth, he explained, was the SOE secretary assigned to Room 055a, where SOE candidates were first interviewed. "The room had two tables, two chairs, and a skylight."<br><br>Peter explained that he had befriended Elizabeth because he wanted a job with SOE. "I had heard that her people were into cloak-and-dagger stuff and had the prettiest secretaries." Elizabeth often held bridge parties at her home, and on one occasion a mutual friend brought Vera along to make up a four. "None of us knew who she was. But I remember she played a very good hand at bridge, probably because she carried everything in her head."<br><br>Elizabeth Norman (now FitzGerald) recalled Vera at the bridge party as "mysterious in some way." She added: "Or rather she covered herself in mystery. And she was gracious--rather too gracious in a way that none of us really were. I think a friend of mine had met her on an ARP [Air Raid Precautions] patrol and just brought her along when we were short of a fourth person. She seemed to have come from nowhere. You see, she was so much older than us other girls. She had no context at all that I discovered. And we didn't ask--one didn't then. We had a sort of code, you know."<br><br>Elizabeth herself had started as a "snagger," a filing clerk, in MI5, which was the Eton or Roedean of Whitehall. She then moved to SOE and recalled that F Section was considered "not quite top notch," "a mixed bunch, mostly City," whereas the Balkan Section had the really "smart," wealthy types, brought in from Hambros or Courtaulds.<br><br>One of Elizabeth's jobs was to tick off recruits as they arrived for interview in 055a--"they were all told it was life and death, but it didn't seem to bother them." Often she was called over to Orchard Court to help out, usually by chatting to agents and drinking cocoa with them to set them at ease before their departure.

Elected to four terms as president, he transformed an inward-looking country into the greatest superpower the world had ever known. Only Abraham Lincoln did more to save America from destruction. But FDR is such a large figure that historians tend to take him as part of the landscape, focusing on smaller aspects of his achievements or carping about where he ought to have done things differently. Few have tried to assess the totality of FDR's life and career.<br><br> Conrad Black rises to the challenge. In this magisterial biography, Black makes the case that FDR was the most important person of the twentieth century, transforming his nation and the world through his unparalleled skill as a domestic politician, war leader, strategist, and global visionary--all of which he accomplished despite a physical infirmity that could easily have ended his public life at age thirty-nine. Black also takes on the great critics of FDR, especially those who accuse him of betraying the West at Yalta. Black opens a new chapter in our understanding of this great man, whose example is even more inspiring as a new generation embarks on its own rendezvous with destiny.</p><p><b>Conrad Black</b> was the chairman and chief executive officer of Hollinger International Inc., among whose newspaper holdings are the <i>Daily and Sunday Telegraph</i> and <i>The Spectator</i> in London, the <i>Chicago Sun-Times,</i> and the <i>Jerusalem Post.</i> He is the author of two previous books published in Canada and became a member of the British House of Lords as Lord Black of Crossharbour in 2001. He divides his time between London, Toronto, and New York.Flying over the Nile near Cairo in October 1943, President Roosevelt looked down and quipped, "Ah, my friend the Sphinx." Sometimes portrayed that way by cartoonists in his time, he is utterly unsphinxlike in Lord Black's new biography. Massive and moving, barbed yet balanced, it is scrupulously objective and coldly unsparing of agenda-ridden earlier biographers and historians. It leaps to the head of the class of Rooseveltian lives and will be difficult to supersede. To Black, the Canadian-born media mogul (he owns the London Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times, among other papers worldwide), the second Roosevelt was, apart from Lincoln perhaps as savior of the Union, the greatest American president, and with no exceptions the greatest of its politicians. No FDR-haters have exposed, credibly, more of Roosevelt's "less admirable tendencies," from "naked opportunism," "deformed idealism" and "pious trumpery" to "insatiable vindictiveness." Yet the four-term president emerges in Black's compelling life as personifying vividly the civilization he, more than any other contemporary, rescued from demoralizing economic depression and devastating world war. His larger-than-life Roosevelt possesses consummate sensitivity and tactical skill, radiating power and panache despite a physical vulnerability from the polio that left him without the use of his legs at 39. "His insight into common men," Black writes, "was the more remarkable because he was certainly not one of them, and never pretended for an instant that he was." By comparison, Black claims, most associates and rivals seemed like kindergarten children, yet some exceptions are fleshed out memorably, notably Roosevelt's selfless political intimates Louis McHenry Howe and Harry Hopkins, and his vigorous presidential competitor in 1940, the surprising Wendell Willkie. (Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor, comes off as both harridan and heroine.) Barring occasional lapses into English locutions like "Boxing Day" and "Remembrance Day"(the days after Christmas and Armistice Day), or "drinking his own bathwater," Conrad's style is lucid and engaging, witty and acerbic, with lines that cry out to be quoted or read aloud, as when he scorns an attack on the devotion of Roosevelt's daughter, Anna, with "Filial concern does not make the President a vegetable or his daughter a Lady Macbeth." A few minor historical errors deserve correction in what will assuredly be further printings, and the later sections appear to be composed in undue haste, but the sweeping and persuasive impact of this possibly off-puttingly big book makes it not only the best one-volume life of the 32nd president but the best at any length, bound to be widely read and discussed. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chiefs</h2><p><p>In the winter of I 1920, the first body is found in Delano, Georgia-the naked, brutalized corpse of a young boy.

He was educated in the local schools and at the University of Georgia, where he graduated with a BA degree in 1959. He served in the United States Air Force, in which he says he "...flew a truck," as an enlisted man during the Berlin Wall crisis of 1961-62.<p> He devoted his early adult years to a career in advertising , as an award-winning writer for agencies in New York and London. It was while living in London in 1973 that he decided to pursue an ambition held since childhood, to write fiction. he moved to a flat in the stable yard of a castle in south County Galway, Ireland, and while working two days a week for a Dublin ad agency to support himself, began work on a novel. Shortly after beginning, he discovered sailing and , as he puts it, "Everything went to hell." The novel was put temporarily aside while he spent all his time, "...racing an eleven foot plywood dinghy against small children, losing regularly."</p><p> In the autumn of 1974, a friend invited him to help ferry a small yacht up the west coast of Ireland, and the bug bit even harder. Shortly thereafter, his grandfather died, leaving him "...just enough money to get into debt for a boat," and he immediately decided to go to the 1976 Observer Single-handed Transatlantic Race (OSTAR). He moved to a gamekeeper's cottage on a river above Cork Harbour and had a boat built at a nearby boatyard. He studied navigation and sailed on other people's boats every chance he got, then, after completing a 1300-mile qualifying voyage from the Azores to Ireland, he persuaded the Race Committee to accept him as an Irish entry.</p><p> He completed the race in good form, taking forty-five days, and in 1977 his memoir of the Irish period, <i>Blue Water, Green Skipper</i> was published in London and New York. While sporadically working on the novel, he completed another book, <i>A Romantic's Guide to the Country Inns of Britain and Ireland,</i> published in 1979.</p><p><i>Chiefs</i>, Woods' long-awaited novel, was published in 1981 to wide critical and popular acclaim, garnering excellent reviews and winning the Edgar Allan Poe Award. <i>Chiefs</i> was filmed for television as a six-hour drama starring Charlton Heston. Following his success with that novel, Woods published a string of fiction that established him as one of the most popular writers in the world.</p><p><i>Orchid Beach</i> is Stuart Woods' eighteenth novel.

At first he ran entirely unconscious of his injuries, then, tearing recklessly through the dark woods, he struck a tree and went down. He lay stunned for a time he could not account for, and when he was finally able to struggle to his feet, the full force of the pain and the winter air swept over him and made him stagger. </p><p>He heard the dog and the man crashing through the brush, and he ran again, wildly, blindly, the undergrowth tearing at his naked body. Abruptly, he broke through onto a road, hesitated, decided against it, and threw himself across the open area into the brush on the other side. He was momentarily in thick, thorny blackberry bushes, then found himself on a narrow path. </p><p>He was failing now, sucking in air with a loud, rasping noise, his muscles aching, legs wobbling. He heard the man fighting through the blackberry bushes, cursing, and he flung himself forward with his remaining strength. He knew he would rather run until he died than go back to that house. He willed his heart to burst, God to take him, hut his exhausted body still carried him unsteadily forward. </p><p>The path turned sharply to the right, but he lunged ahead into thick brush again, hoping for safety. Then he saw stars ahead through the bushes and thought he might break through into a field, while his tormentor followed the path. He gathered his last strength and plunged forward and down, hoping to lie on the ground undetected. </p><p>There was no ground; the earth fell away beneath him. He believed himself to be falling into a ditch, but his ditch had no bottom. He fell, twisting in the air, trying desperately to get his feet under him, while the hard earth waited far below him. </p><p>Copyright 1981 by Stuart Woods</p></p><h2>Hegemony or Survival: America&#39;s Quest for Global Dominance (The American Empire Project)</h2><p>From the world's foremost intellectual activist, an irrefutable analysis of America's pursuit of total domination and the catastrophic consequences that are sure to follow<br><br>The United States is in the process of staking out not just the globe but the last unarmed spot in our neighborhood-the heavens-as a militarized sphere of influence. Our earth and its skies are, for the Bush administration, the final frontiers of imperial control. In <i>Hegemony or Survival </i>, Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this moment, what kind of peril we find ourselves in, and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species.<br><br>With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky dissects America's quest for global supremacy, tracking the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of policies intended to achieve "full spectrum dominance" at any cost. He lays out vividly how the various strands of policy-the militarization of space, the ballistic-missile defense program, unilateralism, the dismantling of international agreements, and the response to the Iraqi crisis-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our survival. In our era, he argues, empire is a recipe for an earthly wasteland.<br><br>Lucid, rigorous, and thoroughly documented, <i>Hegemony or Survival </i> promises to be Chomsky's most urgent and sweeping work in years, certain to spark widespread debate.<br></p><p>Noam Chomsky is considered the father of modern linguistics. In this richly detailed criticism of American foreign policy, he seeks to redefine many of the terms commonly used in the ongoing American war on terrorism. Surveying U.S. actions in Cuba, Nicaragua, Turkey, the Far East and elsewhere over the past half a century along with the modern American war in Iraq, Chomsky indicates that America is just as much a terrorist state as any other government or rogue organization. George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq drew worldwide criticism, in part because it seemed to present a new philosophy of pre-emptive war and an appearance of global empire building. But according to Chomsky, such has been the operating philosophy of American foreign policy for decades. Opponents of the Bush administration's tactics consistently point out how the American government supported Saddam Hussein for many years prior to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait (pictures of Donald Rumsfeld shaking Saddam's hand are easy to come by) as a means of pointing out how the United States is happy to fund despots when it's in American interests. But Chomsky, armed with extensive historical notation, takes this notion further, arguing how the repression of other nations' citizenry is, in fact, the very reason Americans support certain foreign leaders. The charges made throughout the book are severe, as are the dire consequences he posits if current trends are not reversed, and Chomsky is no more likely to make friends or gain supporters from the mainstream now than he's ever been. But <i>Hegemony or Survival</i> is relatively dispassionate. Instead of relying on camp or shock value or personal attacks as some of his contemporaries have done, Chomsky drives his well-supported points steadily forward in an earnest and highly readable style. <i>--John Moe</i>Noam Chomsky is the author of numerous bestselling political works, from <i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i> in the 1960s to 9-11 in 2001. A professor of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT, he is widely credited with having revolutionized modern linguistics.

A sweeping, wide-ranging collection, it presents an intimate and fascinating view of a life in science--a life like no other.From his ruminations on science in our culture and descriptions of the fantastic properties of quantum physics to his report on the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, this book will fascinate anyone interested in Feynman and anyone interested in the world of ideas. Newcomers to Feynman will be moved by his wit and deep understanding of the natural world, and of the human experience.</p><p>The iconoclastic American physicist Richard Feynman won a Nobel Prize for solving a sub-atomic puzzle using home-brewed methods once dismissed as ludicrous. But Feynman arguably did science an even bigger service through his iconoclastic persona, which gave the lie to the view that all scientists are gauche, boring and obsessive. As first revealed in his brilliantly entertaining autobiography <i>Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman!</i>, Feynman was a wise-cracking genius with a penchant for topless bars, bongo-drums and winding people up. And he was obsessive--not about one narrow question, but about the whole puzzle of how Nature works, from the spin of an electron to the spin of wobbling dinner-plates. Since his untimely death from cancer in 1988, many books based on articles by or about Feynman have appeared. So what does <i>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</i> add ? It's touted as a "greatest hits" volume--and it's a fair description. This well-chosen collection allows newcomers to see what all the fuss surrounding Feynman is about, from his work on quantum theory to his safe-cracking exploits during the Manhattan Project. But newcomers and long-standing Feynman fans alike will enjoy the newly-reprinted material, especially a 1979 magazine interview which includes fascinating insights into how a brilliant mind tackles Nature's mysteries. For once, a science book that lives up to its name, giving much pleasure from finding out more about this genuine scientific hero. --<i>Robert Matthews</i>More gems from the Feynman factory. If some things are old or borrowed, it hardly matters: there are enough new or unfamiliar to charm fans. Since the Nobel laureate&#39;s death, there have been biographies, &#34;as-told-to&#34; accounts, and various interviews and selected writings that continue to reveal the workings of one of the most remarkable and inventive minds in physics. But part and parcel with the revelations of genius are the pranks and idiosyncrasies that have built the Feynman legend of bongo player, gambler, bon vivant, and girl watcher. The current collection replays a few of those choice bits. But it&#39;s much more a picture of Feynman as passionate and scrupulously honest scientist, insisting always that truth is never absolute. There is much homage to his father, who inspired the habit of asking questions that go to the heart of the matter of how and why things work. A wonderful Caltech graduation speech allows him to contrast real with pseudoscience and speaks to the absolute necessity of providing one&#39;s peers with all the information they need to judge one&#39;s work. There&#39;s a lovely reminiscence of himself as a nervous 24-year-old asked to present a seminar at Princeton before a group that included Eugene Wigner, John Wheeler, Wolfgang Pauli, John von Neumann and Albert Einstein. When it&#39;s over, Pauli gets up and turns to Einstein and says, don&#39;t you agree that this theory cannot be right? To which Einstein replies, &#34;N-o-o-o.&#34; &#34;Nicest no I ever heard,&#34; Feynman says. The collection includes Feynman&#39;s insightful minority report on the Challenger disaster, his well-known disdainful comments on philosophy and behavioral science, his despair of today&#39;s cultural ignorance of the nature of science, and his prescient thoughts on parallel processing for computers and principles of miniaturization we now call nanotechnology. All said, of course, in the idiom of the boy from New York whose pleasure in finding things out affords the reader another sort of pleasure.

He lives in Washington, D.C., and the Dordogne.</p>Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno Courr�ges seldom felt happier about the community he served as chief of police than when standing at the rear of the ancient stone church of St. Denis, listening to rehearsals of the town choir. Unlike the formal ceremonies at Mass when the singers dressed in neat white surplices, the choir practiced in their normal dress, usually gathering immediately after work. But Father Sentout&#x2019;s daring decision that the choir should reach beyond its usual repertoire to attempt Bach&#x2019;s St. Matthew Passion had required some additional rehearsals early in the morning. Farmers stood alongside schoolteachers and accountants, waitresses and shopkeepers. These were people Bruno knew, wearing clothes he recognized, and usually singing hymns that were familiar, perhaps the only memory of his church orphanage that still gave him pleasure.<br> &nbsp;<br> On this Saturday morning two weeks before Easter, the twenty-four choristers were mostly in casual clothes, and the front pews of the church were filled with coats and shop-ping baskets they would take to the town&#x2019;s market, about to get under way in the street outside. As he entered the twelfth-century church, Bruno heard the first notes that led into the chorus of &#x201c;Behold Him as a Lamb.&#x201d; The noises of the street seemed to ebb away behind him as Florence&#x2019;s pure soprano voice filled the nave. He knew there should be two choirs and two orchestras, but St. Denis made do with its trusty organ and the enthusiasm of its singers plus, of course, the determination of Father Sentout, whose love of choral music was matched only by his devotion to the pleasures of the table and the for-tunes of the local rugby team. It made him, Bruno thought, an entirely suitable pastor for this small town in the gastronomic and sporting heartland of France.<br> &nbsp;<br> The early morning sun lifted above the ridge to the east of St. Denis and flooded the top of the stained-glass window. Shafts of blue, gold and red lanced into the body of the church. Father Sentout&#x2019;s black soutane stood out against the roseate glow that now suffused the choir. Bruno&#x2019;s eye was drawn irresistibly to Florence, dressed in white with a bright red scarf at her throat. Her head was raised as she sang alone, knowing the music too well to need to look at her score. Her fair hair was lit by the sunlight into something almost like a halo.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been one of his better moves, Bruno thought, to have found Florence the job of science teacher at the local <i>coll�ge</i>. The post brought with it a subsidized apartment on the <i>coll�ge</i> grounds, more than big enough for a divorced young woman and her infant twins. She was a fi ne addition to the life of the town and particularly to the choir. Father Sentout might not have dared attempt the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> without her. For the first time, she seemed to notice Bruno standing in the nave. Her face softened into a smile, and she nodded to acknowledge his presence. Other choristers raised their hands in greeting. Bruno felt the familiar trembling at his waist as his mobile phone began to vibrate. Reluctantly, he slipped outside to take the call.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bruno, it&#x2019;s Marie,&#x201d; he heard. She ran the H�tel de la Gare beside the railway station, now unmanned to cut costs on rural lines in order to finance the massive investment in high-speed trains. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asked to pass on a message. Julien Devenon says there&#x2019;s a naked woman in a boat drifting down the river. He says he saw her from the railway bridge as he walked along the line.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her voice sounded strained. Bruno thought of Julien, just entering puberty, transfixed by the sight of a naked woman. But this was troubling. Despite the spring sunshine, this was no time for sunbathing; not even for the Dutch, German and Scandinavian tourists who seemed to discard their clothes at the slightest opportunity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He gets the train to his lyc�e in P�rigueux,&#x201d; Marie added. She paused and her voice took on a deeper note. &#x201c;He thought she was dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is Julien still there?&#x201d; Bruno pictured the boy&#x2019;s eager face as he trotted out for rugby practice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, he had to catch his train. He would have called him-self, but his dad had confiscated his phone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There would be a story behind that, Bruno thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So when did he see this boat? Was it just in the last few minutes?&#x201d; Bruno tried to calculate how long a boat drifting downstream might take to reach the great stone bridge at St. Denis, probably the nearest place he&#x2019;d be able to intercept it and bring it ashore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He said he ran to tell me and the train was just leaving with him as I called you. So maybe three minutes ago, not much more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno ended the conversation and darted up the rue de Paris, dodging between the market stalls and unloading trucks. He brushed aside the outstretched hands and proffered cheeks of the men and women he usually greeted twice each week on market days. He ducked under bales of cloth, dodged trolleys laden with fresh vegetables and skirted men carrying giant wheels of cheese on their heads as he made for the town square and the bridge. Just as he reached it his phone vibrated again, and this time it was Pierrot, the town&#x2019;s most dedicated fisherman.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe what I&#x2019;ve just seen in the river,&#x201d; he began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A naked woman in a boat. I heard already. Where are you exactly?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the campsite, where the bank is high. There&#x2019;s a bend in the river there and the trout&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How fast is the river moving that boat?&#x201d; Bruno interrupted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Five minutes and it will be at the bridge, maybe a bit more,&#x201d; Pierrot said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty waterlogged. One of those old fl at-bottomed boats, haven&#x2019;t seen one for years. Thing is, Bruno, she&#x2019;s lying on her back, naked as a worm, arms out-stretched. I think she&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find out. Thanks, Pierrot,&#x201d; said Bruno, closing his phone as he reached the stone bridge. He looked upstream, blinking against the dazzle of the sun on water. There was no sign of a boat, so he had a little time. He punched the autodial for the medical center into his phone and asked for Fabiola.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not on today,&#x201d; said Juliette at the reception desk. &#x201c;Something about a private patient, which I never heard of before. I&#x2019;ll put you through to Dr. Gelletreau. He&#x2019;s on call today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother,&#x201d; said Bruno, talking as he walked briskly back to the church, ducking and weaving through the obstacle course of market stalls. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time to talk. Just tell the doctor to get to the stone bridge where it looks like we might have a dead body floating downstream. I&#x2019;ll meet him there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He needed Antoine, with a canoe, and Antoine was in the choir. He slipped in through the small portal that was cut into the huge wooden doors and was rocked by the sheer volume the choir was now generating, one half singing &#x201c;See him!&#x201d; and the other half replying &#x201c;Whom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Just before Florence could soar into the solo &#x201c;O Lamb of God Most Holy,&#x201d; Bruno strode forward to tap Father Sentout on the shoulder. The choir stopped raggedly, uncertain, but the organ notes swept on, and Father Sentout opened his eyes, blinking in surprise at the sight of Bruno.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Father, it&#x2019;s an emergency,&#x201d; said Bruno, his voice loud to carry over the organ. &#x201c;There could be a life at stake. I need Antoine most urgently.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The organ music stopped with a dying wheeze from the pipes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want my Jesus?&#x201d; the priest asked, uncertainly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno swallowed hard, trying to comprehend the meaning of the question. Then he remembered that Antoine was singing the role of Jesus.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a waterman and there&#x2019;s a body floating down the river,&#x201d; Bruno said, speaking to the choir as much as to Father Sentout. &#x201c;A woman, in a boat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a canoe nearby,&#x201d; Antoine said, striding down from the apse and picking up a jacket from the front pew. A burly man, he had wide and powerful shoulders from a lifetime of paddling and manhandling canoes. &#x201c;My canoes are all back at the campsite today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need you anyway,&#x201d; said Bruno. He led the way through the thickening market crowd and back to the river, suddenly aware that most of the choir seemed to be following, along with Father Sentout.<br> &nbsp;<br> Passersby and some of the stallholders looked up at the swelling line behind Bruno, and with the automatic curiosity that draws a crowd when people sense a drama unfolding they joined behind. Soon they were clustering at the side of the bridge as Bruno and Antoine spotted the vessel they were expecting tracing lazy circles as it drifted with the current.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It might get caught up on the sandbank,&#x201d; said Antoine. &#x201c;Otherwise we&#x2019;d better get down to my campsite and take out a canoe, tow it ashore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could I wade into the river and catch it here?&#x201d; Bruno asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Better not,&#x201d; said Antoine, demonstrating why Bruno had been right to interrupt the choir and summon the boatman. &#x201c;See that current where it comes through the first arch of the bridge? That&#x2019;s the deep channel. You&#x2019;d be up to your neck or even deeper. You wouldn&#x2019;t have the footing to drag it ashore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> More and more of the townsfolk were gathering on the bridge, craning their necks to watch the boat draw steadily nearer. Among them, camera at the ready, was Philippe Delaron from the photography shop, who doubled as the local correspondent for <i>Sud</i> <i>Ouest</i>. Bruno groaned inwardly. A ghoulish newspaper photo of a corpse in a boat was not the image of St. Denis that he or the mayor would seek to portray.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a punt,&#x201d; said Antoine, surprise in his voice. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen one of those in a long time. They used them for hunting wildfowl in the old days before they built the dams upriver, when we still had wetlands with the flooding every spring.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Should we head for your campsite and get the canoe?&#x201d; Bruno was eager to do something.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Better wait and see if it gets through the current around the bridge,&#x201d; said Antoine, lighting a yellow cigarette, a Gitane <i>Ma�s</i>. Bruno had forgotten they still made them. &#x201c;If it founders, there&#x2019;s no point. And it might still get stuck on the sandbank. If it doesn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ve got an idea. Follow me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Antoine thrust his way back through the crowd and down the steep and narrow stone steps that led from the bridge to the quay where the annual fishing contests were held. Three fishermen sat on their folding stools, each watching his own float and casting the occasional sidelong glance to see if his neighbors were having better luck. None of them seemed to pay much attention to the crowd on the bridge.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Patrice, can you cast a line into that drifting boat and see if you can pull it into the bank?&#x201d; Antoine asked the first of the anglers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice half turned and eyed Antoine sourly. He mumbled something through closed lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; Bruno asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice opened his mouth and took out three wriggling maggots from where he&#x2019;d kept them under his tongue. It was something Bruno had seen the baron do when they went fi shing. Maggots were sluggish in the chill of the morning, and a devoted fisherman would put some in his mouth to get them warm and energetic enough to attract fish once they were on the hook. It was one of the reasons Bruno knew he&#x2019;d never be a real angler.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll lose my bait, could lose a hook and line,&#x201d; Patrice said, putting his maggots back into the old tobacco can where he kept his bait. He paused, squinting against the sun. &#x201c;Is this your business, Bruno?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruno outlined the discovery to Patrice, a small, hunched man, married for forty years to a woman twice his size with a loud and penetrating voice to match. That probably explained the amount of time he spent fishing, Bruno had often thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d try it myself, but you&#x2019;re the best man with a rod and line,&#x201d; Bruno said. He had learned back in his army days that a little flattery was the easiest way to turn a reluctant conscript into an enthusiastic volunteer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Across the river, a white open-topped sports car with sweeping lines raced around the corner of the medical center to the bank where the trailers parked. It braked hard and stopped, wheels spitting up gravel. A fair-haired young man climbed out dressed as if for tennis in the 1930s. He wore a white sports shirt and cream trousers with a colorful belt and ran toward the riverbank shedding his shirt. He paused on the bank to remove his white tennis shoes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The guy&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; said Antoine, spitting out his cigarette. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to dive in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind him another figure stepped gracefully from the car, a woman with remarkably long legs, dressed in black tights and what looked like a man&#x2019;s white shirt, tightly belted with a black sash. Her face was pale and her hair covered in a black turban. The way she moved made Bruno think of a ballerina. She advanced to the bank beside the fair-haired man, and they looked upriver as if trying to assess when the punt might be in reach. The man began wading into the shallows as Bruno called out to him to stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice had his line out of the water. He had removed his bait and fl oat and was fixing his heaviest hook, looking up every few seconds to watch the speed of the punt&#x2019;s approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Stand aside and don&#x2019;t get behind me. This will be a hell of a cast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing at the riverbank, Bruno could see nothing of the dead woman. But something close to three feet tall and black was standing up in the punt, almost like a very short mast. Antoine shrugged when Bruno asked him what it might be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The punt&#x2019;s corner seemed to catch on the edge of the sandbank, and it slowed and turned as if heading for the far bank. Bruno heard cheers and whistles coming from the crowd on the bridge as the young man plunged deeper, assuming that the shallows ran all the way to the sandbank.

He rips into the absurdity of the culture that demonized the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, turned the nation's bathrooms into a lawless free-for-all of urine and fecal matter, and put its citizens at the mercy of a bunch of minimum wagers with axes to grind. Peppered between complaints Carolla shares candid anecdotes from his day to day life as well as his past&#x2014;Sunday football at Jimmy Kimmel's house, his attempts to raise his kids in a society that he mostly disagrees with, his big showbiz break, and much, much more. Brilliantly showcasing Adam's spot-on sense of humor, this book cements his status as a cultural commentator/comedian/complainer extraordinaire.&nbsp;<br>ADAM CAROLLA&nbsp;is a radio and television host, comedian, and actor.

He made me glad that I never leave the house. Going out entails interacting with the general public, and the general public is dumb (no offense to those of you in the general public). And when I say dumb, I don&#x2019;t mean the innocent kind of dumb like a dog that thinks his reflection is another dog. I mean the dangerous kind of dumb, like Lennie in <i>Of Mice and Men</i>&#x2014;good-natured, mentally limited, and tremendously powerful. You leave your house one morning to get groceries, and you end up getting your neck accidentally broken by the guy giving you directions out of the parking lot. <p></p> <i>In Fifty Years We&#x2019;ll All Be Chicks</i> is less of a book, and more of a guide for how to be a better man and/or woman (mostly man).

But that year, at age forty-two, he found his footing again, finishing a play he had begun the previous autumn&#x2014;<i>King Lear</i>&#x2014;then writing two other great tragedies, <i>Macbeth </i>and <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>.<br> <br>It was a memorable year in England as well&#x2014;and a grim one, in the aftermath of a terrorist plot conceived by a small group of Catholic gentry that had been uncovered at the last hour. The foiled Gunpowder Plot would have blown up the king and royal family along with the nation&#x2019;s political and religious leadership. The aborted plot renewed anti-Catholic sentiment and laid bare divisions in the kingdom.<br> <br>It was against this background that Shakespeare finished <i>Lear</i>, a play about a divided kingdom, then wrote a tragedy that turned on the murder of a Scottish king, <i>Macbeth</i>. He ended this astonishing year with a third masterpiece no less steeped in current events and concerns: <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>.<br> <br><i>The Year of Lear</i> sheds light on these three great tragedies by placing them in the context of their times, while also allowing us greater insight into how Shakespeare was personally touched by such events as a terrible outbreak of plague and growing religious divisions. For anyone interested in Shakespeare, this is an indispensable book.</p><p>James Shapiro is the Larry Miller Professor of English at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1985.

His Iraqi-American background has made it easier for him to infiltrate the darkest corners of the war, but death of his beloved Nicola in a suicide bombing has made him reckless. He has nothing left to lose. <br><br>In pursuit of the money, he meets UN representative Daniela Garner, who seems to know more about the heist than anyone else. She's a valuable asset in Baghdad where the possibility of an explosion lurks at every checkpoint. Luca's investigation proves volatile as well, and as he gets closer to the missing money, his actions begin to reverberate around the world. <br><br>In London, Richard North, a top-tier international banker and the one person who might be able to explain where the money has gone, vanishes. The manhunt for him will get Luca evicted from Iraq, separated from Daniela, and possibly end both his investigation and his life.<br><br>As usual, it's all about the money: who has it, who's lost it, and who's ultimately going to pay, as clandestine agents emerge from the shadows and powerful nations seek to control information and bury secrets, whatever the cost.</p><p>Michael Robotham was an investigative journalist in Britain, Australia, and the U.S before his career as a novelist.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<p><strong>I</strong><br>Cerryl shifted his weight He stood in the west corner of the small second-level rampart of the guardhouse before the north gates to the White City of Fairhaven. That was the only corner where the sun touched. His white leather jacket was fastened all the way up to his neck, and even with the heavy shirt and white wool tunic of a full mage underneath, he was cold.<br>He glanced out at the white granite highway that stretched north and, just beyond where he could see, curved eastward toward Lydiar. As the day had passed, it had warmed enough that his breath no longer formed a white cloud, but the north wind still cut through his white woolen trousers. His eyes went down to the armsmen in red-trimmed white tunics who stamped their boots and walked back and forth in front of the gates, waiting for travelers.<br>The rumbling of another set of wheels--iron ones--on the stone alerted Cerryl, and he looked up and out along the highway to study the approaching vehicle, a high-sided wagon painted cyan and cream, escorted by a full score of lancers in cyan livery, ten preceding and ten following the wagon. Cyan was the color of the Duke of Lydiar.<br>Cerryl couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what was being conveyed to Fairhaven with so many lancers: Chests of golds owed for road taxes? Trade goods from the port at Lydiar as some sort of repayment? The ponderous approach of the wagon and the four horses indicated the load was heavy.<br>Slowly, slowly, die teamster in cyan eased the wagon up to the gates and the White armsmen. The Lydian lancers reined up on each side of the wagon and behind.<br>Tariffs and goods for Fairhaven. Bound for the Wizards&#x2019; Square,&#x201c; announced the captain of the Lydians, a squarish black-haired and bearded figure. He extended a scroll to the man in charge Of the inspection and guard detail.<br>Cerryl took a deep breath and let his order/chaos senses study the wagon. Metal--coins in chests, as he had suspected, although there were but three chests. Under the dark gray canvas were also a dozen small barrels, more like quarter-barrels. Salt perhaps. Most salt came from Lydiar, the closest port, for all that it was two long days or three short ones.<br>The head gate guard glanced up at Cerryl, his eyes questioning the mage. Two of the lancers behind the Lydian officer followed his eyes. One swallowed as his eyes took in Cenyl&#x2019;s whites.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the scroll says, ser!&#x201d; the detail leader called up to Cerryl.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as they say, Diborl,&#x201c; Cerryl answered.<br>&#x201c;You may pass,&#x201c; the head guard announced.<br>The wagon rolled past the guardhouse, and Cerryl listened. Listening was the most interesting part of the duty, at least usually.<br>&#x201c;...always have a mage here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Always...Sometimes you see someone get turned to ashes...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;...you&#x2019;re jesting...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No...not something to jest at.&#x201d;<br>Cerryl hadn&#x2019;t had to use chaos fire on any person yet in Ms gate-guard duties, but he&#x2019;d turned two wagons carrying contraband--one had iron blades hidden under the wagon bed--into ashes and sent fee teamster and his assistant to the road crew, where they&#x2019;d spend the rest of their lives helping push the Great White Highway through the Westhorns.<br>The young mage shrugged. He doubted that either man had been the one who had planned the smuggling--or would have benefited much--but he&#x2019;d seen Fenard and Jellico and grown up in Hrisbarg in the shadow of the played-out mines. He&#x2019;d been a mill boy, a scrivener&#x2019;s apprentice, and a student mage under the overmage Jeslek. All those experiences had made one thing clear. Strict as the rules of the Guild were, harsh as the punishments could be, and sometimes as unfair as they had been, from what he&#x2019;d seen the alternatives were worse.<br>After stamping his white boots again, Cerryl walked across the short porch, four steps, and turned back, hoping that keeping moving would keep him warmer. Sometimes, it did. Most times, if didn&#x2019;t.<br>He wanted to yawn. He&#x2019;d thought sewer duty had been tiring, but it hadn&#x2019;t been half so tiring as being a gate guard. At least, in cleaning sewers he&#x2019;d been able to perfect his control of chaos fire. As a gate mage, mostly he just watched from the tiny rampart on top of the guardhouse just out from die north gate. Also, the sewers were warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The sewers did stink, he reminded himself, sometimes a great deal.<br>&#x201c;Ser?&#x201d;<br>Cerryl glanced down.<br>Diborl looked up at the young mage. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got two here need medallions--a cart and a hauler&#x2019;s wagon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming down.&#x201d; Cerryl walked to the back of the porch area, where he descended the tiny and narrow circular stone staircase. He came out at die back of the guardroom. From there he entered the medallion room, where a wiry fanner with thinning brown hair stood. Behind him was a hauler in faded gray trousers and shirt.<br>The farmer had just handed his five coppers across the battered wooden counter to the medallion guard. Behind him, die hauler held a leather pouch, a pouch mat could have held anywhere from several silvers to several golds, depending on the trade and the size of the wagon. That didn&#x2019;t include actual tariffs, either.<br>&#x201c;Ser,&#x201c; said the guard to the farmer, &#x201c;Vykay, there&#x201d;--he pointed to another guard who held a drill, a hammer, and a pouch that Cerryl knew contained soft copper rivets--&#x201d;he and the mage will attach the medallion.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just so as I can get going.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take but a moment,&#x201c; Cerryl assured the man, who looked to be close to the age of Tellis, the scrivener with whom Cerryl had apprenticed before the Guild had found him and made him a student mage.<br>The cart stood at the back of the guardhouse, a brown mule between the traces. The mule looked at Cerryl, and Cerryl looked back, then at the baskets of potatoes in the rear.<br>&#x201c;Medallion should go on the sideboard around here,&#x201c; Vykay positioned the brass plate a handspan below the bottom of the driver&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;That be all right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Might catch on stuff in the stable. A mite bit higher&#x2019;d be better.&#x201d; The farmer nodded. &#x201c;New wagon. Old one not much better than a stone boat no more.&#x201d;<br>The guard raised the medallion and glanced at Cerryl.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>With quick motions, the guard used a grease stick to mark the wood, then took out the hand drill and began to drill the holes for the rivets.<br>&#x201c;Can remember when it was only three coppers,&#x201c; the farmer said to Cerryl. &#x201c;Before your time, young mage.&#x201d; He offered a wintry smile. &#x201c;Not be complaining, though. Do no good, and &#x2018;sides, I&#x2019;d rather be using the White highways than those muddy cow paths they call roads.&#x201d;<br>Cerryl nodded, his eyes straying to the medallion Vykay had laid on the wagon seat-simple enough, just a rectangular plate with the outline of the White Tower stamped on it and the numeral 1, for winter, and the year.<br>&#x201c;Just about ready, ser,&#x201c; Vykay announced, straightening, placing the medallion on the sideboard, and slipping the rivets/pins through the holes in the medallion and in the cart sideboard. Then came the offset clamps and two quick blows with the hammer. The guard glanced at Cerryl.<br>The White mage nodded and concentrated, raising a touch of chaos and infusing the medallion and rivets. He could feel the heat in his forehead, not enough to raise a sweat, but noticeable to him. &#x201c;There.&#x201d; Cerryl turned to the farmer. &#x201c;Your cart is allowed on all White highways for another year, ser. I must warn you that if anyone tampers with the medallion, you will need another. And...they could get hurt.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be knowing that, but I thank you.&#x201d; The farmer offered a brusque nod and took the leads to the mule, flicking them and leading the cart away, walking beside the mule, rather than riding.<br>Cerryl glanced at the second vehicle-a long and high gray wagon with bronze trim. The painted emblem on the side read: &#x201c;Kyrest and Fyult, Grain Factors.&#x201d;<br>The hauler stood by die wagon. &#x201c;If you could just replace...&#x201d;<br>Vykay nodded and looked at Cerryl.<br>Cerryl extended his senses and bled away the remaining chaos, although there was so little left that no one would have been hurt, even if Vykay had removed the old medallion.<br>Vykay produced a chisel and, with two quick snaps, removed the old medallion and then replaced it with the new.<br>Cerryl added the chaos lock, then looked at the guard. &#x201c;Is that all for now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ser.&#x201d;<br>With a smile, Cerryl slipped away and back up to his perch on the second level of the guardhouse. He glanced back northward over the highway, momentarily empty near the gates, though he thought he saw another wagon in the distance making its way through the gray-leaved hills, toward Fairhaven. Because of the alignment of the city, he found it strange that the north gate actually controlled the travelers from Hrisbarg and Lydiar and the far east of Candar. It was also strange, as he reflected upon it, how much straighter the Great White Highway was in Gallos and western Certis than near Fairhaven itself--yet Fairhaven was the home of the Guild and the mages who had labored centuries to build the great highways of eastern Candar.<br>Stamping his feet again, he walked back and form on the walkway behind the rampart several more times, but his feet remained cold, almost numb.<br>The bell rang, its clear sound echoing on the rampart, but Cerryl had already stepped forward with the sound of wheels on stone once more.<br>A farm wagon stood before the guards. Three men in rough browns stood by the wagon.

What is it about writers, we wonder, that empowers them to work words into shapes and patterns that move us? The most affecting photographs possess that same power -- to reach out upon first sight, to capture our hearts and minds, to leave us smitten. <br> Such is the feeling that comes from gazing at the work of Marion Ettlinger, a photographer celebrated for her "literary portrait power" <i>(The Wall Street Journal). Author Photo</i> collects, for the first time in book form, more than two hundred of Ettlinger's most famous photographs. Immortalized in these pages are many of America's greatest writers, including Raymond Carver, Francine Prose, Walter Mosley, Mary Karr, John Irving, Joyce Carol Oates, Truman Capote, Cormac McCarthy, Patricia Highsmith, Ken Kesey, Edwidge Danticat, and Jeffrey Eugenides. <br> According to one of Ettlinger's Pulitzer Prize-winning subjects, "starkness and a sense of shadows" are at the core of her artistic allure. Shot exclusively in natural light and in black-and-white film, each of these images is an intimate artwork, putting the reader closer than ever before to the writers they revere and admire. A photographic paean to the literary spirit, <i>Author Photo</i> opens a rare and revealing window onto the timelessness of creativity.</p><p><b>Marion Ettlinger</b> has been a photographer since 1968. She lives in New York City.Books can be works of art in terms of both their literary content and their design. <p>Richard Ford introduces <i>Author Photo</i>, an almost wantonly satisfying collection of photographs by Ettlinger, who has made a genuine art form out of taking author's pictures. Ford describes Ettlinger as "tiny, exotic-seeming, dark-eyed," then muses over what exactly makes her author portraits so powerful. He concludes that it's a "confronting sensation of personal nearness," and, indeed, each beautifully composed portrait, whether it's theatrical or frank, is the fruit of an intimate collaboration between photographer and subject. Who has Ettlinger photographed? Alice Munro and Jennifer Egan. Raymond Carver and Ana Castillo. Russell Banks and ZZ Packer. Haruki Murakami and Thomas Mallon. Richard Rhodes and Erica Jong. Some writers are no longer with us, others are not readily recognized, but all are compelling. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In addition to practical yoga instruction, Avalon gives a detailed explanation of the chakra system and writes with clarity and elegance on the often misunderstood topics of mediation and mantra. While maintaining his public profile as a judge and scholar of British Indian Law, Avalon- whose real name was Sir John George Woodroffe- was also a private student of the Tantras. He published a large body of texts and translations and thus pioneered the modern academic study of Tantra in the West. He was born in 1865 and died 1936.</p><p>Born on December 15th, 1865,John Woodroffe was educated at Woburn Park School and University College, Oxford, where he graduated in jurisprudence and the Bachelor of Civil Law examinations. In 1890, He moved to India and enrolled as an advocate in Calcutta High Court. He was soon made a Fellow of the Calcutta University and appointed Law Professor there.He was appointed Standing Counsel to the Government of India in 1902 and two years later was raised to the High Court Bench.After serving for eighteen years in the bench, he became Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court in 1915.After retiring to England he became Reader in Indian Law at the University of Oxford, and finally moved to France in his retirement, where he died in 1936. Alongside his judicial duties he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and was especially interested in the esoteric Hindu Tantric Shakti system. He translated some twenty original Sanskrit texts, and under his pseudonym Arthur Avalon.He published and lectured prolifically and authoritatively on Indian philosophy and a wide range of Yoga and Tantra topics. His most popular and influential book, a major contribution to the appreciation of Indian philosophy and spirituality, is The Serpent Power The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga ,which is the source of many modern Western appropriations of Kundalini practice.

Author Stephen Cohen shows that what US officials and other experts call "reform" has for most Russians been a catastrophic development&#x2015;namely the unprecedented demodernization of a twentieth-century country&#x2015;and for the United States the worst foreign policy disaster since Vietnam. What emerges is an alarming analysis of nuclear-laden Russia after 1991, representing an even greater threat to our national security than during the Cold War, and an indictment of American journalists and policy makers who failed to see or report the truth about the complicity of U.S. policy in a great human tragedy. This paperback edition has been updated to reflect the events of the last year. "Cohen writes with bracing clarity on a subject obscured by euphemisms and double talk."&#x2015;Robert D. Kaplan, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>Stephen F. Cohen is director of Russian studies at Princeton University and a regular commentator on network television.An incisive and occasionally caustic critique of American attitudes toward post-Soviet Russia.Russian expert Cohen (<i>Voices of Glasnost</i>, not reviewed) takes the reader through a decade of American policymaking that he views as nothing less than an unmitigated disaster. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, he argues, the Clinton administration, along with the majority of American scholars and journalists, has embarked on an ideological crusade, preaching the necessity of monetarist, free-market reforms and unflinchingly supporting the Yeltsin administration despite incontrovertible evidence that the reforms and the reformer have driven Russia back into the 19th century. Cohen is especially compelling in demonstrating the parallel between contemporary American "transitionologists" (those who believe Russia is in a period of "transition" to American-style free market democracy) and the Communists themselves-both have proved willing to overlook the poverty, chaos, and misery created by "shock therapy" reforms in the name of a purportedly golden future. While Cohen's argument is effectively laid out, however, it bogs down in the book's middle section, where he reprints a series of articles written since 1992. Cohen's prescience and deep understanding of Russian society are easy to glean from these pieces, but their repetitiveness soon takes on a smirking quality. The final third of the study, in which Cohen outlines a new Russia policy based on respect for Russian realities and the dangers posed by the country's nuclear arsenal, is marred by a different kind of self-importance: perhaps because he studies Russia for a living, Cohen gives it a centrality in his analysis of American policymaking that at times verges on the unbelievable. These are minor flaws, however, in an otherwise thoroughly convincing work.Unafraid to be contentious or to stand accused of nostalgia for the Soviet Union, Cohen offers a blistering, brilliant, and deeply felt critique of America's decade-long daydream of a Russia in transition. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Dixon-Gordon, PhD</b>, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to chastise those who don&#x2019;t control their anger and suggest their problem lies in a lack of motivation, but we now know that for many, the problem lies in a lack of anger management skills. This easy-to-read and easy-to-use workbook is framed in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and lays out a road map for identifying anger triggers and the skills that are essential to handling these triggers. Most impressive, the workbook artfully provides the reader with a broad menu of strategies while allowing each individual to zero in and really focus in the areas most central to their own struggles.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Carl Lejuez</b>, professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, College Park; founding director of the Center for Addictions, Personality, and Emotion Research; and founding editor of the journal&nbsp;<i>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Chapman and Gratz have tackled the significant human challenge of anger and provide a much-needed, easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to making anger &#x2018;an ally rather than an enemy.&#x2019; They provide skillful guidance in better understanding, recognizing, and responding to our own angry responses so that anger does not disrupt our lives. Their practical, compassionate approach will help clients (and therapists who work with them) to learn new skills for managing their anger, including how to express it effectively and how to recover following angry interactions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who struggles with anger, and to those committed to helping them lead more satisfying lives.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Lizabeth Roemer, PhD</b>, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and coauthor of&nbsp;<i>The Mindful Way through Anxiety</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook for Anger</i> by Chapman and Gratz uses current dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) emotion theory and behavioral principles to create a practical, easy-to-read guidebook for managing unhelpful anger.

The authors provide a thorough education on anger, beginning with a useful description of the many diagnoses and clinical presentations that anger often accompanies. They then walk readers through the components of anger, vulnerability factors for anger, keys to recognizing anger, and consequences of anger. They include strategies for increasing commitment to changing it, describe a range of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills for reducing it, provide methods to express it appropriately, offer ways of changing thinking that fuels it, and, importantly, suggest ways to repair relationships after inevitable anger &#x2018;slipups&#x2019; occur. The book includes relevant case vignettes and numerous easy-to-use worksheets that help readers engage with and apply the material. Chapman and Gratz have produced a work in easy-to-understand, clear language that makes behavior therapy principles and DBT skills for the emotion of anger readily accessible to readers.

Most people struggle to get by; Frank takes it easy in his mother's whorehouse, which caters to members of the occupying forces. But Frank is restless. He is a pimp, a thug, a petty thief, and, as <b><i>Dirty Snow</i> </b>opens, he has just killed his first man. Through the unrelenting darkness and cold of an endless winter, Frank will pursue abjection until at last there is nowhere to go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hans Koning has described <i><b>Dirty Snow</b></i> as "one of the very few novels to come out of German-occupied France that gets it exactly right." In a study of the criminal mind that is comparable to Jim Thompson's <i>The Killer Inside Me</i>, Simenon maps a no man's land of the spirit in which human nature is driven to destruction&#x2014;and redemption, perhaps, as well&#x2014;by forces beyond its control.</p></p><p>Georges Simenon was one of the most popular and esteemed novelists of the 20th century. He wrote close to 200 novels, many devoted to the legendary Inspector Maigret.&#x201c;Attention should be paid to the New York Review of Books' continuing reissues of Georges Simenon. Simenon was legendary both for his literary skill&#x2013;four or five books every year for 40 years&#x2013;and his sexual capacity, at least to hear him tell it. What we can speak of with some certainty are the novels, which are tough, rigorously unsentimental and full of rage, duplicity and, occasionally, justice. Simenon's tone and dispassionate examination of humanity was echoed by Patricia Highsmith, who dispensed with the justice. So far, the Review has published <i>Tropic Moon, The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, Red Lights, Dirty Snow </i>and <i>Three Bedrooms in Manhattan</i>; <i>The Strangers in the House</i> comes out in November. Try one, and you'll want to read more.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Palm Beach Post</i> <br><br>&#x201c;What many regard as the finest of all noir novels..."--Tim Rutten, <i>The Los Angeles Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;<i>Dirty Snow</i> is an astonishing work....a bleak masterpiece, its darkness is as William T. Vollmann writes in a perceptive afterword, 'as solid and heavy as the interior of a dwarf star.'&#x201d; --John Banville, <i>The New Republic<br></i><br>&#x201c;<i>Dirty Snow </i>is both exhilirating and taxing: exhilirating because it frees the reader to imagine unthinkable acts of violence and degradation and, if not to approve of them exactly, then at least to better understand their origin; and taxing because of the effort it takes to even visit Simenon&#x2019;s nihilist world for a while. ... <i>Dirty Snow</i> has an eerie locomotion, an eerie appeal.&#x201d; --Bill Eichenberger, <i>Columbus Dispatch</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Simenon may not have thought much of humanity, but few writers have captured its squalid core the way he did.&#x201d; --<i>Time Out New York</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary...

Georges Simenon has that to the tips of his fingers.&#x201d;--Thorton Wilder <br><br>&#x201c;At his best, Simenon is an all-round master craftsman- ironic, disciplined, highly intelligent, with fine descriptive power. His themes are timeless in their preoccupation with the interrelation of evil, guilt and good; contemporary in their fidelity to the modern context and Gallic in precision, logic and a certain emanation of pain or disquiet. His fluency is of course astonishing. His life is itself a work by Simenon.&#x201d; --Francis Steegmuller <br><br>&#x201c;Georges Simenon is more than prolific. His psychological intensity and compression of style mark him as a leading writer of the Century.&#x201d;-- <i>The New York Times <br><br></i>"Georges Simenon is a recent discovery for me -- not the Maigret books, but what Simenon called his "romans durs", such as "Dirty Snow" and "Three Bedrooms in Manhattan" -- and hard they are indeed. The latest of these New York Review Books reissues, "Tropic Moon" (translated from the French by Marc Romano) is a dark masterpiece set among French colonials in heart-of-darkness Gabon in the early 1930s. Cruel, erotic, frightening and superb." -- John Banville, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Just So Stories (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>Kipling&#39;s own drawings, with their long, funny captions, illustrate his hilarious explanations of How the Camel Got His Hump, How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, How the Armadillo Happened, and other animal How&#39;s. He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.</p><p>How did the camel get his hump? Why won&#39;t cats do as they are told? Who invented reading and writing? How did an inquisitive little elephant change the lives of elephants everywhere? Kipling&#39;s imagined answers to such questions draw on the beast fables he heard as a child in India, as well as on folk games with language, exploring the relationships between thought, speech, and the written word. He also celebrates his own joy in fatherhood. The tales were told to his own and his friends&#39; children over many years before he wrote them down, adding poems and his own illustrations. They invite older and younger readers to share a magical experience, each contributing to the other&#39;s pleasure, but each can also enjoy them alone, as more jokes, subtexts, and exotic references emerge with every reading. This fully illustrated edition includes two extra stories and Kipling&#39;s own explanation of the title.<b>Rudyard Kipling</b> was born in Bombay, India to British parents on December 30, 1865. In 1871, Rudyard and his sister, Trix, aged three, were left to be cared for by a couple in Southsea, England. Five years passed before he saw his parents again. His sense of desertion and despair were later expressed in his story &#x201c;Baa Baa, Black Sheep&#x201d; (1888), in his novel <i>The Light that failed</i> (1890), and his autobiography, <i>Something of Myself </i>(1937). As late as 1935 Kipling still spoke bitterly of the &#x201c;House of Desolation&#x201d; at Southsea: &#x201c;I should like to burn it down and plough the place with salt.&#x201d;At twelve he entered a minor public school, the United Services College at Westward Ho, North Devon. In <i>Stalky and CO.</i> (1899) the myopic Beetle is a self-caricature, and the days at Westward Ho are recalled with mixed feelings. At sixteen, eccentric and literary, Kipling sailed to India to become a journalist. His Indian experiences led to seven volumes of stories, including <i>Soldiers Three</i> (1888) and <i>Wee Willie Winkie</i> (1888).At twenty-four he returned to England and quickly tuned into a literary celebrity. In London he became close friends with an American, (Charles) Wolcott Balestier, with whom he collaborated on what critics called a &#x201c;dime store novel.&#x201d; Wolcott died suddenly in 1891, and a few weeks later Kipling married Wolcott&#x2019;s sister, Caroline. The newlyweds settled in Brattleboro, Vermont, where Kipling wrote <b>The Jungle Book</b> (1895), and most of C<b>aptains Courageous </b>(1897). By this time Kipling&#x2019;s popularity and financial success were enormous.In 1899 the Kipling&#x2019;s settled in Sussex, England, where he wrote some of his best books:<b> Kim</b> (1901), <b>Just So Stories</b> (1902), and <b>Puck of Pooks Hill </b>(1906). In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize for literature. By the time he died, on January 18 1936, critical opinion was deeply divided about his writings, but his books continued to be read by thousands, and such unforgettable poems and stories as &#x201c;Gunga Din,&#x201d; &#x201c;If,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Man Who Would Be King,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&#x201d; have lived on in the consciousness of succeeding generations.</p><h2>The Vagabonds: The Story of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison&#39;s Ten-Year Road Trip</h2><p><b>The fascinating story of two American giants&#x2014;Henry Ford and Thomas Edison&#x2014;whose annual summer sojourns introduced the road trip to our culture and made the automobile an essential part of modern life, even as their own relationship altered dramatically. </b><br><br>In 1914 Henry Ford and naturalist John Burroughs visited Thomas Edison in Florida and toured the Everglades. The following year Ford, Edison, and tire maker Harvey Firestone joined together on a summer camping trip and decided to call themselves the Vagabonds. They would continue their summer road trips until 1925, when they announced that their fame made it too difficult for them to carry on.<br> <br>Although the Vagabonds traveled with an entourage of chefs, butlers, and others, this elite fraternity also had a serious purpose: to examine the conditions of America&#x2019;s roadways and improve the practicality of automobile travel. Cars were unreliable and the roads were even worse. But newspaper coverage of these trips was extensive, and as cars and roads improved, the summer trip by automobile soon became a desired element of American life.<br> <br>In <i>The Vagabonds</i> Jeff Guinn shares the story of this pivotal moment in American history. But he also examines the important relationship between the older Edison and the younger Ford, who once worked for the famous inventor. The road trips made the automobile ubiquitous and magnified Ford&#x2019;s reputation, even as Edison&#x2019;s diminished. The automobile had come of age and it would transform the American landscape, the American economy, and the American way of life.<br> <br>Guinn brings to life this seminal moment when a new industry created a watershed cultural shift and a famous businessman became a prominent political figure. <i>The Vagabonds </i>is a wonderful story of two American giants and the transformation of the country.</p><p>Jeff Guinn is an&nbsp;award-winning former investigative journalist and the bestselling author of numerous books, including <i>Go Down Together: The True Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde</i>;<i> The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the OK Corral&#x2014;And How It Changed the West</i>;&nbsp;<i>Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</i>; and <i>The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and Peoples Temple</i>. Guinn lives in Fort Worth, Texas.The Vagabonds Prologue<p></p> Paris, Michigan<p></p> <br>Mid-August 1923<br> <br>Bad weather plagued much of Michigan during the late summer of 1923. Unseasonably cool temperatures combined with near-constant rain, trapping residents indoors and tamping down what had been, for the last fifteen years or so, an ever-increasing influx of tourists eager to enjoy the state&#x2019;s bracing mix of sprawling woodlands, arching hills, and sparkling lakes.<br> <br>This was especially true in the tiny, unincorporated township of Paris, named in the 1850s for early settler John Parish. Somewhere along the line the &#x201c;h&#x201d; was dropped. If most of Michigan eerily resembled a palm-down left hand, Paris was located at approximately the lowest joint of the ring finger. Grand Rapids, the nearest city of any consequence, was sixty-five miles to the south, several hours&#x2019; hard driving given the poor quality of the roads wending their way through that part of the state. Paris, like most of its neighboring villages in Mecosta County, was a stop for the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad to take on water and load timber and other goods after its tracks were laid across the state in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Paris residents, rarely numbering above the mid-hundreds, were mostly farmers. Others worked at the state fish hatchery in town&#x2014;the wide Muskegon River flowed nearby. The hatchery was the town&#x2019;s crown jewel. When the train left town, it always carried containers of brown trout &#x201c;fingerlings&#x201d; to stock lakes and rivers all over the region. Many of the humble houses in town were still fairly new. A fire in 1879 had decimated much of the early settlement, and cash-strapped locals took almost a generation to completely rebuild.<br> <br>Early in Paris&#x2019;s modest existence, outsiders usually arrived as passengers on a Sunday-only &#x201c;picnic train&#x201d; from Grand Rapids that made one of its stops near the hatchery. These visitors frequently purchased drinks, snacks, and notions at Montague&#x2019;s store. The Montagues were among the area&#x2019;s first settlers. In 1923, Charlie Montague ran the shop. To attract a new generation of customers, he&#x2019;d installed gas pumps out front. In only two decades, the number of automobiles in America had swelled from approximately eight thousand to about ten million. Highway 131, a bumpy dirt/gravel hybrid that frequently tore tires, chipped paint, and cracked windshields, ran through the middle of town. In Michigan as everywhere else in the country, Americans increasingly used cars for weekend or extended holiday travel as well as day-to-day work- or errand-related driving. &#x201c;Gypsying&#x201d; was an early, popular term for such outings. Participants were known as &#x201c;vacationists,&#x201d; or, if extended trips involved pitching tents at night, &#x201c;autocampers.&#x201d; Many drove through Paris on their way to somewhere more interesting, often Traverse City further to the northwest, which offered ferry services to whisk passengers and their cars to the frequently spectacular climes of Michigan&#x2019;s Upper Peninsula across Lake Michigan.<br> <br>The first full-fledged gas stations had begun springing up around the country, but most of these were located in cities or else along the nation&#x2019;s more improved major highways. Backcountry drivers generally depended on mom-and-pop grocery pumps like those at Montague&#x2019;s for fuel replenishment. As out-of-town traffic through town increased, so did Charlie Montague&#x2019;s income from sales of gasoline and motor oil. Some Paris residents owned cars, too. Like their fellow field-tillers across the land, Mecosta County farmers initially opposed the car gypsiers, who frequently camped overnight on their land without permission and left behind mounds of trash. But the farmers eventually realized the time-saving benefit of hauling crops to market by car rather than horse-drawn wagon and joined in automobile ownership themselves. There were still a lot of horses and wagons in Paris. At about 25 cents a gallon, Charlie rarely sold more than $100 worth of gas in a busy week. Thanks to the inclement weather so far in August that restricted driving for town residents and gypsiers alike, he&#x2019;d lately been hard-pressed to sell that much.<br> <br>This made what happened in mid-month all the more surprising. On a drizzly afternoon, Paris townsfolk were out and about, puttering in gardens, visiting on stoops with neighbors, or shopping at Montague&#x2019;s, when they heard the purr of powerful engines. Then out of the mist on Highway 131 there appeared from the southeast a fleet of very grand automobiles, six in all, Lincolns and Cadillacs and two other vehicles that looked like nothing anyone in Paris had seen or even imagined before, hulking squarish metal wagons clearly built for hauling bulky loads.<br> <br>The impressive caravan glided to a stop outside Montague&#x2019;s. The driver&#x2019;s side doors of the passenger vehicles opened, and from them emerged strapping men outfitted in matching khaki uniforms that resembled military garb. A small crowd gathered as these uniquely dressed fellows took turns filling their cars with gasoline. The onlookers, too intimidated to ask outright, whispered among themselves: Who are these people? After a few moments, their collective gaze switched to the windows of the passenger cars, staring at the men and women who still sat inside the automobiles, keeping out of the drizzle. Then a few locals felt sufficiently emboldened to move forward, and someone blurted loudly, &#x201c;That guy in the back seat looks like Henry Ford!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was.<br> <br>For any number of reasons&#x2014;his outspoken pacifism prior to the recent world war, speculation about his prospects for the U.S. presidency in the upcoming 1924 election, constant print and photographic coverage that made his name and hawklike visage familiar, his widely perceived championing of the working class with high wages and shortened workdays, and, above all, for his modestly priced Model T that, for the first time, made car ownership possible even for people of limited means&#x2014;Henry Ford had become perhaps the most famous man in America. He was certainly the most famous ever to show up unexpectedly in Paris, Michigan, and everyone in the crowd pushed forward to see him for themselves. Ford obligingly got out of his car. He offered no wave of greeting or any other theatrical gesture&#x2014;he was deservedly renowned as a singularly undemonstrative man who in particular eschewed speeches. But with that exception Ford generally accepted the responsibilities of his celebrity&#x2014;he&#x2019;d worked diligently to cultivate it, realizing early on that his personal fame heightened demand for Model Ts&#x2014;and so Ford stood in the dampness, nodding and smiling pleasantly, letting the crowd have a good look. The gawkers were only momentarily satiated. Then their excitement escalated, for if this was Henry Ford with an accompanying fleet of luxury cars, then it surely must mean . . .<br> <br>Most summers for approximately the last decade, Henry Ford set out on auto trips that often extended two weeks or more, visiting remote towns and small communities, camping sometimes in parks and more frequently on private land, always asking permission first from owners and if required compensating them generously. On every trip, Ford was accompanied by friends&#x2014;sometimes other business magnates or else government officials, high-ranking Ford staff members, once the now recently deceased president Warren G. Harding. His road companions always included two stalwart Ford pals, tire tycoon Harvey Firestone and much beloved inventor Thomas Edison, the only living American whose fame rivaled Ford&#x2019;s own. After a few such trips, the trio, together with a fourth friend, the late naturalist John Burroughs, fancifully dubbed themselves &#x201c;the Vagabonds,&#x201d; and each year the announcement of their latest summer excursion sparked endless speculation about where they might venture next. A general region was always cited in advance, but not a specific route. They might pop up anywhere&#x2014;speculation was rampant. In 1923, it was known that the Vagabonds would attend Harding&#x2019;s funeral in Ohio, then motor on into the Upper Midwest, possibly through Wisconsin and undoubtedly parts of Michigan. Town newspapers throughout the region were full of wishful speculation&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful if they stopped here? Paris residents, who mostly read either the Battle Creek Enquirer or the more local Big Rapids Pioneer, would have held little hope that the celebrity troupe would motor their way. One of the Vagabonds&#x2019; avowed goals on this summer&#x2019;s trip was to visit Ford lumber interests in Michigan&#x2019;s Upper Peninsula, most easily reached from Ohio by driving due north through eastern Wisconsin. Yet here was Henry Ford, rain dripping off the brim of his hat, and if Ford was present that must mean somewhere in one of those passenger cars sat Thomas Edison, and there he was, the great head topped by messily flopping silver hair making him easy to recognize as well. But Edison didn&#x2019;t get out; he was in the early stages of a nasty cold and the weather was too severe. Harvey Firestone, his last name far better known than his genial, generic face, was identified inside several of the cars, and always in error. Firestone and his family, traveling in yet another fine car, were many miles away because their driver had gotten lost. This happened frequently on the Vagabonds&#x2019; summer trips. One car or another would take a wrong turn on a poorly marked road, and someone on the trip&#x2019;s support staff would eventually be tasked with tracking down the missing vehicle and guiding it back on route.<br> <br>Meanwhile, here were Ford and Edison and (supposedly) Firestone in Paris, apparently making a brief stop to refuel, but then Henry Ford had a question for the crowd: Did anyone know the way to Jep Bisbee&#x2019;s house? They all did&#x2014;everybody in Paris knew where everybody else lived&#x2014;and Ford&#x2019;s inquiry further ratcheted up their sense of speculative wonder, for eighty-one-year-old Jep was the closest thing tiny Paris had to a hometown celebrity. For all of his lengthy adult life, Jep variously earned his daily bread as a store clerk, drugstore and grocery store manager, house painter, and farmer. In the most current edition of The Farm Journal Illustrated Directory of Mecosta County, an ad-saturated directory of who lived where locally, Jep was identified as a shoemaker. But his real talent, and true professional love, was playing his handmade fiddles at area dances and festivals. Jep had a family to support, so he couldn&#x2019;t fully embrace the itinerant, constantly hand-to-mouth career of a country musician, but Sarah Bisbee, his wife of forty-four years, and their now grown kids were good musicians, too, and quite often the entire Bisbee family performed onstage, fiddle and piano and second fiddle and clarinet and bass fiddle and sometimes even a bass drum. Set lists always featured old-fashioned favorites like &#x201c;Turkey in the Straw&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Girl I Left Behind Me,&#x201d; the kind of tunes that set toes a-tapping and lent themselves perfectly to square dancing. All of which was fine for hardscrabble folks in Mecosta County, and in other neighboring parts of their sparsely populated region. By local standards, Jep&#x2019;s music career was a considerable success. But how could an important big-city man like Henry Ford have even heard of old Jep Bisbee?<br> <br>In front of Montague&#x2019;s, Ford offered no explanation. He simply asked directions to the Bisbee home and waited through the beat or two it took for the crowd to digest the question and respond. A parade of volunteers stepped up to lead the auto caravan a few hundred yards to Jep&#x2019;s. The cars rolled slowly along and stopped in front of a nondescript residence with a small barn out back. As town residents continued staring, Ford got out of his car again, marched to the front door, and knocked. A second man came with him. When Mrs. Sarah Bisbee emerged, she was naturally taken aback by the sight of Henry Ford on the stoop, with a fleet of cars and apparently half the town right behind him. Ford politely introduced himself and the second man, Edward Kingsford, who managed one of Ford&#x2019;s lumber businesses in the Upper Peninsula. Ford asked if Mr. Bisbee was home. Later, as witnesses added embellishments, Mrs. Bisbee was described as calmly ushering her famous visitor and his companion right in, acting for all the world as though celebrities appeared on her doorstep all the time, but the reality was that she needed to gather herself before mumbling that Jep was out in the barn. Instinctive good manners compelled her to invite them in while her husband was fetched&#x2014;a number of townsfolk, eavesdropping for all their ears were worth, heard Ford&#x2019;s question and gleefully hustled to the barn on his behalf&#x2014;but shock prevented Mrs. Bisbee from fully embracing her sudden role as hostess to the great and asking Ford to bring along all the other people who remained in the cars outside.<br> <br>Mrs. Bisbee seated Ford and Kingsford in her modest parlor. When Jep hustled in, Ford, never one for unnecessary chitchat, immediately asked him to get his fiddle and play. As a lifelong musician for hire, Jep was accustomed to performing on demand. This circumstance was certainly different&#x2014;Henry Ford appearing out of nowhere in his home&#x2014;but the request itself was normal enough. Jep got his fiddle and Kingsford explained why they&#x2019;d come. Some years earlier, Kingsford heard Jep play at a dance. It was well-known among Ford associates that their employer loathed modern music&#x2014;he found jazz particularly detestable&#x2014;but thoroughly enjoyed traditional tunes and the square dances, waltzes, and polkas associated with them. When Kingsford learned that Ford was coming up through southwest Michigan on this summer&#x2019;s trip, he suggested a stop in Paris so that the boss could savor some of Jep&#x2019;s fiddling in person. And now, here they were.<br> <br>Jep enjoyed the story and started to play, with his wife accompanying him on piano. No account exists of the songs they played, but whatever they were, Ford was enchanted. He toe-tapped right along, and when the Bisbees paused for a moment between numbers Ford sent Kingsford to summon the rest of the party. In came Thomas Edison, wide-bellied and clad as usual in rumpled clothes that looked like they&#x2019;d been slept in, which they probably had&#x2014;on Vagabonds trips, Edison was notorious for curling up for naps underneath trees, beside babbling brooks, or across car seats. Behind him were two ladies, Clara Ford and Mina Edison. As grande dames fully aware of their exalted social status, they were appropriately dressed to appear in public, in long flowing dresses that covered them from neck to instep with armorlike corsets beneath&#x2014;nothing about an upper-class woman must appear to jiggle&#x2014;and fashionable bonnets that remained pinned to their finely coiffed hair even indoors.<br> <br>This was a moment when true country hospitality might have required the offering of refreshments, and how was Mrs. Bisbee to know what, in her limited larder, would be deemed acceptable by such American royalty? But Henry Ford rescued her from such a delicate decision. He&#x2019;d come to hear music, not snack, and asked politely but firmly for the Bisbees to play some more. They did, and two unexpected things happened. First, Edison moved his chair directly beside where Jep stood, and bent so that his ear was almost directly over the fiddle&#x2019;s ringing strings. It was widely known that Thomas Edison was exceptionally hard of hearing, and here was proof.

If your finances had a 10 percent chance of suffering a severe loss, you'd reevaluate your assets. So if we know the world is warming and there's a 10 percent chance this might eventually lead to a catastrophe beyond anything we could imagine, why aren't we doing more about climate change right now? We insure our lives against an uncertain future--why not our planet?</p><p>In <i>Climate Shock</i>, Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman explore in lively, clear terms the likely repercussions of a hotter planet, drawing on and expanding from work previously unavailable to general audiences. They show that the longer we wait to act, the more likely an extreme event will happen. A city might go underwater. A rogue nation might shoot particles into the Earth's atmosphere, geoengineering cooler temperatures. Zeroing in on the unknown extreme risks that may yet dwarf all else, the authors look at how economic forces that make sensible climate policies difficult to enact, make radical would-be fixes like geoengineering all the more probable. What we know about climate change is alarming enough. What we don't know about the extreme risks could be far more dangerous. Wagner and Weitzman help readers understand that we need to think about climate change in the same way that we think about insurance--as a risk management problem, only here on a global scale.</p><p>Demonstrating that climate change can and should be dealt with--and what could happen if we don't do so--<i>Climate Shock</i> tackles the defining environmental and public policy issue of our time.</p></p><p><p>"A remarkable book on climate change, <i>Climate Shock</i> is deeply insightful, challenging, eye-opening, thought-provoking, and sheer fun to read.

It is a political novel set in a domestic context, with a universal theme, the generational divide between fathers and sons. Set in 1859 at the moment when the Russian autocratic state began to move hesitantly towards social and political reform, the novel explores the conflict between the liberal-minded fathers of Russian reformist sympathies and their free-thinking intellectual sons whose revolutionary ideology threatened the stability of the state. At its centre is Evgeny Bazorov, a strong-willed antagonist of all forms of social orthodoxy who proclaims himself a nihilist and believes in the need to overthrow all the institutions of the state. As the novel develops Bazarov&#39;s political ambitions become fatally meshed with emotional and private concerns, and his end is a tragic failure. The novel caused a bitter furore on its publication in 1862, and this, a year later, drove Turgenev from Russia.</p><p>When &#34;Fathers and Sons was first published in Russia, in 1862, it was met with a blaze of controversy about where Turgenev stood in relation to his account of generational misunderstanding. Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.Ann Pasternak Slater is a Fellow of St. Anne s College, Oxford.

Expansion beyond Muscovy&#x2019;s forested confines began in the fifteenth century, when Ivan III rejected Mongol rule and moved into the Russian steppe. The waterways linking the Baltic to the Black and Caspian seas were crucial to Russia&#x2019;s development from the Middle Ages onward. The age-old quest to acquire warm-water ports culminated in the construction of St. Petersburg in the eighteenth century, when imperial Russia began to rival Europe&#x2019;s Great Powers.</p><p>From Ivan the Terrible to Catherine the Great, Lenin and Stalin to Yeltsin and Putin, Russia&#x2019;s rulers have carved their nation&#x2019;s destiny into world history, sometimes bending Russia toward despotism or democracy, internationalism or brusque independence. Russia&#x2019;s titanic conflicts&#x2015;against the Tatars and Turks, Napoleon, Nazi Germany, and the United States&#x2015;and its political upheavals from the Time of Troubles to the Soviet Union&#x2019;s downfall, as well as ongoing strife in Chechnya and Crimea, are presented chronologically in accessible text accompanied by detailed maps and illustrations.</p></p><p>Ian Barnes was Emeritus Chair of the Department of History at the University of Derby and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.[<i>Restless Empire</i>] uses dozens of maps to visualize a thousand years of geopolitical turbulence...Most powerful are [Barnes&#x2019;s] maps of the wars that repeatedly threatened to tear the empire apart, from Napoleon&#x2019;s doomed invasion in 1812 to Hitler&#x2019;s Operation Barbarossa in 1941. (Joshua Hammer <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>The word &#x2018;atlas&#x2019; brings to mind a collection of geographic maps, but that image doesn&#x2019;t do justice to the richness, imagination, and comprehensiveness of this physically beautiful volume. Barnes has collected and painstakingly reproduced maps and texts that trace Russian history from the origins of the Slavs (800&#x2013;200 BC) to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea... The impact is visually stunning and gives this massive expanse of history a physical quality. (Robert Legvold <i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>This beautiful book tells the story of Russia through maps, beginning with the Slavic migrations from 900 to 500 BCE and ending with what the author calls the &#x2018;Shadow Empire&#x2019; of the Russian Federation and the assertions of Vladimir Putin that parts of Moldova and Ukraine constitute a &#x2018;New Russia.&#x2019; In between, maps show the shifting boundaries of empires, the roles of serfs and Jews, and the wars that challenged and shaped Russian self-understanding. Barnes, who died just before finishing the manuscript, can&#x2019;t explain Russian thinking about the meaning of its territory and its menacing eye on its neighbors, nor can he predict how the story will end, but he superbly illuminates the complexity and the diversity of this mysterious country. (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>This historical atlas is timely, showing precisely the factors, patterns, and geography that led to present-day tensions with Russia. The book is richly illustrated and well written and, as with all great atlases, can be described as beautiful. Its strengths are the quality, number, breadth, and detail of the maps.

This sympathetic yet evenhanded book records for the first time the complete story of SNCC&#x2019;s evolution, of its successes and its difficulties in the ongoing struggle to end white oppression.</p><p>At its birth, SNCC was composed of black college students who shared an ideology of moral radicalism. This ideology, with its emphasis on nonviolence, challenged Southern segregation. SNCC students were the earliest civil rights fighters of the Second Reconstruction. They conducted sit-ins at lunch counters, spearheaded the freedom rides, and organized voter registration, which shook white complacency and awakened black political consciousness. In the process, Clayborne Carson shows, SNCC changed from a group that endorsed white middle-class values to one that questioned the basic assumptions of liberal ideology and raised the fist for black power. Indeed, SNCC&#x2019;s radical and penetrating analysis of the American power structure reached beyond the black community to help spark wider social protests of the 1960s, such as the anti&#x2013;Vietnam War movement.</p><p>Carson&#x2019;s history of SNCC goes behind the scene to determine why the group&#x2019;s ideological evolution was accompanied by bitter power struggles within the organization. Using interviews, transcripts of meetings, unpublished position papers, and recently released FBI documents, he reveals how a radical group is subject to enormous, often divisive pressures as it fights the difficult battle for social change.</p></p><p>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC, pronounced &#39;snick&#39;) emerged from the seemingly sterile American political landscape of the 1950s, thrived amidst the mass struggles of the 1960s, and died in the barren atmosphere of repression, divisiveness, and self-absorption of the early 1970s. As racial discord and discontent broke through a facade of accommodation, a series of isolated acts of resistance ignited the modern African-American freedom struggle.Clayborne Carson is Professor of History at Stanford University and Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project.</p><h2>Managing Pasture: A Complete Guide to Building Healthy Pasture for Grass-Based Meat &amp; Dairy Animals</h2><p>The health and profitability of grass-based livestock begins with the food they eat. In <i>Managing Pasture</i>, author Dale Strickler guides farmers and ranchers through the practical and ideological considerations behind caring for the land as a key part of running a successful grass-based operation, from the profitability of replacing expensive grain feed with nutrient-rich native grasses to the benefits of ecologically-minded land management.<br><br> In-depth examinations of the biology and benefits of grazing plants and different grazing strategies accompany detailed plans for paddock and fencing set-ups, livestock watering, and effective methods for dealing with common pasture problems throughout the seasons, from mud to drought. For readers invested in pasture improvement strategies that offer environmental benefits beyond better meat and dairy,&nbsp;including carbon sequestration, erosion prevention, increased pollinator resources and wildlife habitat, and improved water quality,&nbsp;<i>Managing Pasture</i> is an approachable, accessible guide to creating and caring for the grassland that feeds animals and future generations.</p><p>Pasture Can Be Profitable<br><br> Grass-based meat and dairy products are in demand. Consumers are hungry for nutritious, hormone-free meat and milk from pastured livestock, which means that farmers and ranchers can reap the financial rewards of pasture production &#x2013; with the right approach.<br><br> Farmer and rancher Dale Stricker's straighforward methods for profitable pasture management will revolutionize how you see your grasslands, with detailed guidance on fencing and grazing strategies, planting for native grass growth, and more. Beyond financial gains, producers will discover long-term environmental benefits, including improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and habitat for diverse wildlife and pollinators.

As such, it has an obvious appeal for struggling artists who feel that the system has snubbed them, and it is perused by gallerists who turn the pages hoping their names don't appear. This quinquennial collection brings together such predictable pieces as the "25 most obnoxious people in the art world" and a parodic summary of gallery owner Larry Gagosian's career. But those who know the rag only by reputation may be surprised to find one of the most balanced considerations of Ron Athey's performance art and a blistering attack on 60 Minutes's cheap shot at contemporary art. Maybe the editors don't simply hate art after all, just its attendant hype and hoopla. This is far from the final word on the art world in the 1990s, but it does present a point of view that gets little airing elsewhere.

There is a pressing need to create healthy places and to reduce the health threats inherent in places already built. However, there has been little awareness of the adverse effects of what we have constructed-or the positive benefits of well designed built environments. <br>&nbsp; <br>This book provides a far-reaching follow-up to the pathbreaking Urban Sprawl and Public Health, published in 2004. That book sparked a range of inquiries into the connections between constructed environments, particularly cities and suburbs, and the health of residents, especially humans. Since then, numerous studies have extended and refined the book's research and reporting. Making Healthy Places offers a fresh and comprehensive look at this vital subject today. <br>&nbsp; <br>There is no other book with the depth, breadth, vision, and accessibility that this book offers.

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, <br>Of unimprov�d mettle hot and full, <br>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there <br>Sharked up a list of landless resolutes <br>For food and diet to some enterprise <br>That hath a stomach in't, which is no other - <br>And it doth well appear unto our state - <br>But to recover of us, by strong hand <br>And terms compulsative, those foresaid lands <br>So by his father lost: and this, I take it, <br>Is the main motive of our preparations, <br>The source of this our watch and the chief head <br>Of this post-haste and rummage in the land. <br> <br> <i>Enter Ghost again</i> <br> <br>But soft, behold!

They attempt to strike it <br> <br>BARNARDO 'Tis here! <br> <br>HORATIO 'Tis here! <br> <br>MARCELLUS 'Tis gone! <i>Exit Ghost</i> <br>We do it wrong, being so majestical, <br>To offer it the show of violence, <br>For it is as the air invulnerable, <br>And our vain blows malicious mockery. <br> <br>BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew. <br> <br>HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing <br>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard <br>The cock, that is the trumpet to the day, <br>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat <br>Awake the god of day, and at his warning, <br>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, <br>Th'extravagant and erring spirit hies <br>To his confine: and of the truth herein <br>This present object made probation. <br> <br>MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock. <br>Some say that ever gainst that season comes <br>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, <br>The bird of dawning singeth all night long, <br>And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad: <br>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, <br>No fairy talks, nor witch hath power to charm, <br>So hallowed and so gracious is the time. <br> <br>HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it. <br>But, look, the morn in russet mantle clad, <br>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill. <br>Break we our watch up, and by my advice, <br>Let us impart what we have seen tonight <br>Unto young Hamlet, for upon my life, <br>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. <br>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, <br>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? <br> <br>MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know <br>Where we shall find him most conveniently. <i>Exeunt</i> <br> <br> <b><br>Act 1 Scene 2</b> <i>running scene 2</i> <br> <i><br>Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,<br>Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant</i> <br> <br>KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death <br>The memory be green, and that it us befitted <br>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom <br>To be contracted in one brow of woe, <br>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature <br>That we with wisest sorrow think on him <br>Together with remembrance of ourselves. <br>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, <br>Th'imperial jointress of this warlike state, <br>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, <br>With one auspicious and one dropping eye, <br>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, <br>In equal scale weighing delight and dole, <br>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barred <br>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone <br>With this affair along. For all, our thanks. <br>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras, <br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth, <br>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death <br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, <br>Colleagu�d with the dream of his advantage, <br>He hath not failed to pester us with message <br>Importing the surrender of those lands <br>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, <br>To our most valiant brother. So much for him. <br> <br> <i>Enter Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting, <br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ <br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras - <br>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears <br>Of this his nephew's purpose - to suppress <br>His further gait herein, in that the levies, <br>The lists and full proportions, are all made <br>Out of his subject. And we here dispatch <br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, <br>For bearing of this greeting to old Norway, <br>Giving to you no further personal power <br>To business with the king, more than the scope <br>Of these dilated articles allow. <i>[Gives a paper]</i> <br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. <br> <br>VOLTEMAND In that, and all things, will we show our duty. <br> <br>KING We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.- <br> <br> <i>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? <br>You told us of some suit: what is't, Laertes? <br>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane <br>And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, <br>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? <br>The head is not more native to the heart, <br>The hand more instrumental to the mouth, <br>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. <br>What wouldst thou have, Laertes? <br> <br>LAERTES Dread my lord, <br>Your leave and favour to return to France, <br>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark <br>To show my duty in your coronation, <br>Yet now I must confess, that duty done, <br>My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France <br>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. <br> <br>KING Have you your father's leave?

[ <i>Aside?</i>] <br> <br>GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour off, <br>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. <br>Do not forever with thy veil�d lids <br>Seek for thy noble father in the dust: <br>Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die, <br>Passing through nature to eternity. <br> <br>HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common. <br> <br>GERTRUDE If it be, <br>Why seems it so particular with thee? <br> <br>HAMLET 'Seems', madam? Nay it is: I know not 'seems'. <br>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, <br>Nor customary suits of solemn black, <br>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, <br>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, <br>Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage, <br>Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, <br>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, <br>For they are actions that a man might play, <br>But I have that within which passeth show; <br>These but the trappings and the suits of woe. <br>KING 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, <br>To give these mourning duties to your father: <br>But you must know your father lost a father, <br>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound <br>In filial obligation for some term <br>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever <br>In obstinate condolement is a course <br>Of impious stubbornness: 'tis unmanly grief: <br>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, <br>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, <br>An understanding simple and unschooled. <br>For what we know must be and is as common <br>As any the most vulgar thing to sense, <br>Why should we in our peevish opposition <br>Take it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven, <br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, <br>To reason most absurd, whose common theme <br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, <br>From the first corpse till he that died today, <br>'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth <br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us <br>As of a father; for let the world take note, <br>You are the most immediate to our throne, <br>And with no less nobility of love <br>Than that which dearest father bears his son, <br>Do I impart towards you. For your intent <br>In going back to school in Wittenberg, <br>It is most retrograde to our desire, <br>And we beseech you bend you to remain <br>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, <br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. <br> <br>GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: <br>I prithee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. <br> <br>HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you, madam. <br> <br>KING Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. <br>Be as ourself in Denmark.- Madam, come: <br>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet <br>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof, <br>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today <br>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, <br>And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, <br>Re-speaking earthly thunder.

Demonstrated are interventions for children, adolescents, and adults facing a variety of clinical problems and life challenges. Case-based chapters from leading practitioners illuminate major theoretical perspectives, including psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, developmental, and other approaches. Also examined is what current research in psychology and neuroscience can tell us about the scientific basis for art therapy. Discussing applications in individual psychotherapy, couple and family treatment, and group work, the Handbook includes over 100 samples of drawings and other artwork. The process of art therapy is illustrated in helping clients manage and cope with such problems as trauma, sexual abuse, developmental and learning disabilities, drug and alcohol misuse, serious mental illness, and medical illness. Appendices include descriptions of empirically supported approaches to art-based assessment, some of which are written by the instrument developers themselves. <br></p><p>Cathy A.

This episode and several others in the epic anticipate stories in the Bible and in Homer, to the great interest of biblical and classical scholars.

Fully a quarter of its citizens either perished from starvation or emigrated, with so many dying en route that it was said, "you can walk dry shod to America on their bodies." In this grand, sweeping narrative, Ireland''s best-known historian, Tim Pat Coogan, gives a fresh and comprehensive account of one of the darkest chapters in world history, arguing that Britain was in large part responsible for the extent of the national tragedy, and in fact engineered the food shortage in one of the earliest cases of ethnic cleansing. So strong was anti-Irish sentiment in the mainland that the English parliament referred to the famine as "God's lesson." <br>Drawing on recently uncovered sources, and with the sharp eye of a seasoned historian, Coogan delivers fresh insights into the famine's causes, recounts its unspeakable events, and delves into the legacy of the "famine mentality" that followed immigrants across the Atlantic to the shores of the United States and had lasting effects on the population left behind. This is a broad, magisterial history of a tragedy that shook the nineteenth century and still impacts the worldwide Irish diaspora of nearly 80 million people today.</p></p><p><p>Tim Pat Coogan is Ireland's best known historian and the author of numerous important works on Irish history, including <i>Michael Collins</i> and <i>The IRA, </i>published to wide acclaim. The former editor of The Irish Press, he lives in Dublin, Ireland.</p><p>&#x201c;Many intriguing points [are] made in this book...Coogan's pages spark and sputter with a deep, lingering, well-cherished rage.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Behrens, The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;To many, Mr. Coogan... [is the] voice of modern Irish history... makes a compelling case for why we should revisit our current understanding of [the famine].&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Coogan's insistent examining of the moral dimensions of that nation's policies, and how they fueled the horrors on the ground, represents his greatest contribution to the voluminous scholarship on the Irish famine, and is this book's greatest strength.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;In disturbingly graphic images and compelling language based on true stories from the Famine archives and peppered with his own perspective, Coogan captures the utter devastation wrought by Ireland's greatest ecological disaster which reduced the population by one fourth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Irish Edition</i></p><p>&#x201c;The best part is that it did such a good job at keeping me interested that I'm eager to read on and learn more.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fingers and Prose</i></p><p>&#x201c;Coogan makes no bones about accusing the government of the day of "a genocidal intent" ... His writing on Ireland's past is intelligent and accessible to a large readership.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BBC History Magazine</i></p></p><h2>Writing History, Writing Trauma (Parallax: Re-visions of Culture and Society)</h2><p><p>Trauma and its often symptomatic aftermath pose acute problems for historical representation and understanding. In <i>Writing History, Writing Trauma,</i> Dominick LaCapra provides a broad-ranging, critical inquiry into the problem of trauma, notably with respect to major historical events. In a series of interlocking essays, he explores theoretical and literary-critical attempts to come to terms with trauma as well as the crucial role post-traumatic testimonies&#x2015;particularly Holocaust testimonies&#x2015;have assumed in recent thought and writing. In doing so, he adapts psychoanalytic concepts to historical analysis and employs sociocultural and political critique to elucidate trauma and its after effects in culture and in people.</p><p>In the first chapter LaCapra addresses trauma from the perspective of history as a discipline. He then lays a theoretical groundwork for the book as a whole, exploring the concept of historical specificity and insisting on the difference between transhistorical and historical trauma. Subsequent chapters consider how Holocaust testimonies raise the problem of the role of affect and empathy in historical understanding, and respond to the debates surrounding Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.</i> The book's concluding essay, "Writing (About) Trauma," examines the various ways that the voice of trauma emerges in written and oral accounts of historical events. Theoretically ambitious and historically informed, <i>Writing History, Writing Trauma</i> is an important contribution from one of today's foremost experts on trauma.</p></p><p><p><b>Dominick LaCapra </b> is in the Andrew D. White Center for Humanities at Cornell University. </p><p>LaCapra's analysis of trauma is folded into an ambitious and compelling reflection on the possibilities for a genuinely cross-disciplinary theoretical dialogue on history... Important reading not only to trauma theorists and their critics, but to historians and literary critics of all persuasions invested in rethinking the relationship between trauma, history and ethics.</p> (Debarati Sanyal <i>SubStance</i>)<br><br><p>Intellectually complex yet lucid.</p> (Erik Weisengruber <i>Literary Research</i>)<br><br><p>Thoughtful and compelling... LaCapra's discussions of historiography, philosophy, and psychoanalysis are extraordinarily lucid, and this book is a brilliant example of some of the capabilities of contemporary trauma theory in analyzing representations of trauma.</p> (<i>Tikkun</i>)<br><br><p>The strength of LaCapra's text lies in its urgency, in the clarity of its commitment to historiographic adequacy and the constructive potential of a psychoanalytic mode of interpretation, and in its appeal to a sense of civic responsibility.</p> (Nina Goss and Gary Handwerk <i>Criticism</i>)<br><br><p>Until now trauma studies lacked the kind of discerning metacommentary that would adjudicate among its emergent logics, truth claims, intellectual strategies, objects of analysis, and scholarly positions. That dream of totalization, however, is precisely what LaCapra casts doubt upon in his important new book.</p> (Walter Kalaidjian <i>Modernism/Modernity</i>)<br><br><p>LaCapra's insightful and compassionate <i>Writing History, Writing Trauma</i> concerns the interpretation of historical traumas such as the Holocaust and the traumas' enduring effects. LaCapra both uses and transcends contemporary critical theory in assessing the influence of trauma on present-day historical writing.</p> (Richard L. Rubenstein <i>Holocaust and Genocide Studies</i>)<br><br><p>One could not wish for a more judicious, lucid, and compassionate guide through the complexities of post-traumatic writing than LaCapra. No one has done more to sustain the vitality and humanity of critical thinking in the face of those historical events&#x2015;above all the Shoah&#x2015;which seem to defy comprehension. These essays will frame the debates on the 'writing of trauma' for years to come. LaCapra lays out, with the care, precision, and compassion we have come to expect from him, the terms and distinctions by which we can begin to think through the complexities of post-traumatic writing. These essays provide absolutely crucial points of orientation in the haunted spaces of post-Holocaust culture, thought, and representation.</p> (Eric Santner, University of Chicago)<br><br><p>In these typically cogent essays, LaCapra once again works to determine subtle and necessary distinctions between history and trauma, absence and loss, and theory and practice while never reducing them to binaries. Few other historians have so forcefully appealed to the power of empathy in addressing historical trauma, and none have done so much to place history and critical theory into a mutually enriching and necessary dialogue.</p> (Carolyn Dean, Brown University)<br><br><p>These are essays on the cutting edge, consistent in theme and perspective, carefully argued, sometimes personal, always clear. <i>Writing History, Writing Trauma</i> offers a critique of unalloyed 'objectivism,' combined with a lively attempt to conceptualize how history writing should deal with the 'post-traumatic'&#x2015;a category that is merging more and more with 'post-modernism,' 'post-structuralism,' and 'post-Holocaust.'.</p> (Geoffrey Hartman, Yale University)</p><h2>Physiology of Behavior -- Books a la Carte (12th Edition)</h2><p><p><b><i>The most current, comprehensive, and teachable text for biological psychology</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughtfully organized, <i>Physiology of Behavior</i> provides a scholarly yet accessible portrait of the dynamic interaction between biology and behavior.

He had planned to study nuclear physics, but when he discovered in an introductory psychology course that psychology was really a science, he decided that was what he wanted to do. Before changing his major, Carlson talked with several professors and visited their laboratories, and when he saw what physiological psychologists do, he knew that he had found his niche. He stayed on at Illinois and received his Ph.D. Then, after a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Iowa, Carlson came to the University of Massachusetts, where he&#x2019;s been ever since.<br> <br>When he arrived at UMass, Carlson established a laboratory where he investigated the role of the limbic system in species-typical and learned behaviors, continuing work he had done at the University of Illinois. He received several Biomedical Research Support Grants and a research grant from NICHD. As he became more involved in textbook writing, Carlson began to focus his attention more and more on this activity and on his teaching.<br> <br>Carlson took the opportunity afforded by his first sabbatical leave to write the first edition of <i>Physiology of Behavior</i>. He very much enjoyed the experience, and this endeavor taught him much more about behavioral neuroscience. He was gratified with the positive response of his students and of the colleagues who adopted the book. The pleasure provided by this response and by the enjoyment of keeping up with the literature and writing about it has kept him going for 12 editions. (He has no plans to stop writing.)<br> <br>Carlson retired from UMass in the fall of 2004 but continues to keep up with developments in the field of behavioral neuroscience and to revise his book. The Psychology Department has kindly let him keep an office at the university, which makes it easier for him to continue interacting with his former colleagues.<br> <br>Carlson&#x2019;s interests outside of writing include spending time with his family, traveling, fly fishing, skiing, and flying his small airplane.<br>As an undergraduate psychology major at Cornell University, <b>Melissa A. Birkett </b>discovered courses in biopsychology, behavior, endocrinology, and evolutionary psychology. There, she was introduced to interdisciplinary research incorporating multiple perspectives in the challenging task of understanding behavior. She became interested in learning about behavior and its underlying mechanisms. She worked as an undergraduate research assistant in several laboratories on projects ranging from insect behavior to sleep in undergraduates. Those formative experiences and interactions with several influential research mentors convinced her to pursue a career in research. <br> <br>Melissa completed her PhD in the Neuroscience and Behavior program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (where Neil Carlson was a faculty member at the time). While there, she received training in visual neuroscience and psychopharmacology. Her interest in neuroscience and behavior grew to encompass the importance of effective teaching and pedagogy and she concurrently earned a master&#x2019;s degree in science education. <br> <br>In 2007, she accepted a faculty position at Northern Arizona University in the Department of Psychological Sciences. Melissa currently conducts research related to the stress response and teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in neuroscience, psychopharmacology, and the teaching of psychology. Each semester, she supervises student researchers and seeks to provide them with the kinds of opportunities she found valuable as a student. Her work has been recognized with awards for both outstanding teaching and teaching innovation, and she has contributed to several publications on best practices in teaching neuroscience. <br> <br>Melissa is excited for the opportunity to contribute to the twelfth edition of <i>Physiology of Behavior</i> and hopes that this text continues to engage new students, introducing them to this fascinating interdisciplinary field.<br></p><h2>UNITED STATES HISTORY SURVEY READING AND NOTETAKING STUDY GUIDE ON-LEVEL 2008C</h2><p><p>Developed to meet the needs of a survey course covering from prehistory-1765 to the present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>A Field Guide to Ferns : And Their Related Families : Northeastern and Central North America (Peterson Field Guides)</h2><p>More than 500 species of northeastern and central North American ferns are described and illustrated, with helpful details such as color, leaf shapes, measurements, and root forms.

The plan consists of how each of twenty different tree groups relates to its natural environment and how these specific trees can be used to promote health or to counteract the effects of pollution and global warming. The plan also reveals the fascinating history of these trees in Native American culture, including their medicinal uses. Finally, the Bioplan offers practical design ideas and tips---where to plant these trees, what season they look best in, what native plants complement them---as well as organic care and how to grow them.</p><p>Beresford-Kroeger captures the magic spell that trees cast over us.

The last twenty years has seen a cottage industry of books on this divide, but with little consensus emerging. Plantinga, as a top philosopher but also a proponent of the rationality of religious belief, has a unique contribution to make. His theme in this short book is that the conflict between science and theistic religion is actually superficial, and that at a deeper level they are in concord. <br><br>Plantinga examines where this conflict is supposed to exist -- evolution, evolutionary psychology, analysis of scripture, scientific study of religion -- as well as claims by Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Philip Kitcher that evolution and theistic belief cannot co-exist. Plantinga makes a case that their arguments are not only inconclusive but that the supposed conflicts themselves are superficial, due to the methodological naturalism used by science. On the other hand, science can actually offer support to theistic doctrines, and Plantinga uses the notion of biological and cosmological "fine-tuning" in support of this idea. Plantinga argues that we might think about arguments in science and religion in a new way -- as different forms of discourse that try to persuade people to look at questions from a perspective such that they can see that something is true. In this way, there is a deep and massive consonance between theism and the scientific enterprise.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alvin Plantinga</strong> is O'Brien Professor of Philosophy, at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author of: <em>Essays on the Metaphysics of Modality</em>, <em>The Nature of Necessity</em>, <em>Warrant and Proper Function</em>, <em>Warrant: The Current Debate</em>, <em>Warranted Christian Belief</em>, and <em>Science and Religion: Are they</em> <em>Compatible?</em> (with Dan Dennett).<br><br>"His thesis is both controversial and straightforward...His arguments are clear, forceful, and often compelling... The result is a feisty and formidable work, one that deserves a broad reception and careful evaluation." --<em>Trinity Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>Where the Conflict Really Lies</em> is an ambitious volume....

She is cofounder and coeditor of the <em>Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion.</em></p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Setting the Problem, Laying the Ground </b></p><p>The need for a feminist Judaism begins with hearing silence. It begins with noting the absence of women's history and experiences as shaping forces in the Jewish tradition. Half of Jews have been women, but men have been defined as normative Jews, while women's voices and experiences are largely invisible in the record of Jewish belief and experience that has come down to us. Women have lived Jewish history and carried its burdens, but women's perceptions and questions have not given form to scripture, shaped the direction of Jewish law, or found expression in liturgy. Confronting this silence raises disturbing questions and stirs the impulse toward far-reaching change. What in the tradition is ours? What can we claim that has not also wounded us? What would have been different had the great silence been filled? </p><p>Hearing silence is not easy. A silence so vast tends to fade into the natural order; it is easy to identify with reality. To ourselves, women are not Other. We take the Jewish tradition as it has been passed down to us, as ours to appropriate or ignore. Over time, we learn to insert ourselves into silences. I Speaking about Abraham, telling of the great events at Sinai, we do not look for ourselves in the narratives but assume our presence, peopling the gaps in the text with women's shadowy forms. It is far easier to read ourselves into male stories than to ask how the foundational stories within which we live have been distorted by our absence. Yet it is not possible to speak into silence, to recover our history or reclaim our power to name without first confronting the extent of exclusion of women's experience. Silence can become an invitation to experiment and explore-but only after we have examined its terrain and begun to face its implications. </p><p>This chapter has two purposes: to chart the domain of silence that lies at the root of Jewish feminism and to take up the methodological presuppositions that inform my thinking. While it is not my primary intention in this book to set out an indictment of Judaism as a patriarchal tradition, criticism is an ongoing and essential part of the Jewish feminist project. Not only is criticism a precondition for imagining a transformed Judaism; without a clear critique of Judaism that precedes and accompanies reconstruction, the process of reconstruction easily can be misconstrued as a form of apologetics. In exploring the territory of silence and describing my methodology, I mean to prevent this misunderstanding by clarifying the stance and intent that underlie my constructive thinking. </p><p><b>Exploring the Terrain of Silence</b></p><p>In her classic work The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir argues that men have established an absolute human type-the male --against which women are measured as Other. Otherness, she says, is a pervasive and generally fluid category of human thought; I perceive and am perceived as Other depending on a particular situation. In the case of males and females, however, Otherness is not reciprocal: men are always the definers, women the defined. While women's self-experience is an experience of selfhood, it is not women's experience that is enshrined in language or that has shaped our cultural forms. As women appear in male texts, they are not the subjects and molders of their own experiences but the objects of male purposes, designs, and desires. Women do not name reality, but rather are named as part of a reality that is male-constructed. Where women are Other, they can be present and silent simultaneously; for the language and thought-forms of culture do not express their meanings. </p><p>De Beauvoir's analysis provides a key to women's silence within Judaism, for, like women in many cultures, Jewish women have been projected as Other. Named by a male community that perceives itself as normative, women are part of the Jewish tradition without its sources and structures reflecting our experience. Women are Jews, but we do not define Jewishness. We live, work, and struggle, but our experiences are not recorded, and what is recorded formulates our experiences in male terms. The central Jewish categories of Torah, Israel, and God all are constructed from male perspectives. Torah is revelation as men perceived it, the story of Israel told from their standpoint, the law unfolded according to their needs. Israel is the male collectivity, the children of a Jacob who had a daughter, but whose sons became the twelve tribes .3 God is named in the male image, a father and warrior much like his male offspring, who confirms and sanctifies the silence of his daughters. Exploring these categories, we explore the parameters of women's silence.</p><p>In Torah, Jewish teaching, women are not absent, but they are cast in stories told by men. As characters in narrative, women may be vividly characterized, as objects of legislation, singled out for attention. But women's presence in Torah does not negate their silence, for women do not decide the questions with which Jewish sources deal. When the law treats of women, it is often because their "abnormality" demands it. If women are central to plot, the plots are not about them. Women's interests and intentions must be unearthed from texts with other purposes, for both law and narrative serve to obscure them. </p><p>The most striking examples of women's silence come from texts in which women are most central, for there the normative character of maleness is especially jarring. In the family narratives of Genesis, for example, women figure prominently. The matriarchs of Genesis are all strong women. As independent personalities, fiercely concerned for their children, they often seem to have an intuitive knowledge of God's plans for their sons. Indeed, it appears from the stories of Sarah and Rebekah that they understand God better than their husbands. God defends Sarah when she casts out Hagar, telling Abraham to obey his wife (Gen. 21:12).-1 Rebekah, knowing it is God's intent, helps deceive Isaac into accepting Jacob as his heir (Gen. 25:23; 27:5-17).</p></p><h2>Cave and Cosmos: Shamanic Encounters with Another Reality</h2><p>In 1980, Michael Harner blazed the trail for the worldwide revival of shamanism with his seminal classic <i>The Way of the Shaman. </i>In this long-awaited sequel, he provides new evidence of the reality of heavens. <br><br>Drawing from a lifetime of personal shamanic experiences and more than 2,500 reports of Westerners&#x2019; experiences during shamanic ascension, Harner highlights the striking similarities between their discoveries, indicating that the heavens and spirits they&#x2019;ve encountered do indeed exist. He also provides instructions on his innovative core-shamanism techniques, so that readers too can ascend to heavenly realms, seek spirit teachers, and return later at will for additional healing and advice. <br><br>Written by the leading authority on shamanism, <i>Cave and Cosmos</i> is a must-read not only for those interested in shamanism, but also for those interested in spirituality, comparative religion, near-death experiences, healing, consciousness, anthropology, and the nature of reality.<br><br><b>Praise for Michael Harner and <i>The Way of the Shaman</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What Yogananda did for Hinduism and D.

His classic books on the subject have been translated into many languages.<b>&#x201c;Spirit Power and the Cave&#x201d; by Michael Harner</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>An excerpt from the book <i>Cave and Cosmos: Shamanic Encounters with Another Reality</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Power</b><br><br>In February 1957, a small band of Shuar (J�varo) men and I became lost after trekking for weeks through mountainous Upper Amazon rainforest. Tired, disoriented, and hungry, we finally ran into a friendly group of Shuar hunters who told us that we had been going in exactly the wrong direction. They shared a bit of their provisions and pointed the way toward the Shuar neighborhood we sought.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leaving the hunters, we soon came to a small but raging river, fed by recent rainstorms in the Andes to the west. This was an obstacle to our further progress, so we waited for several days for the waters to go down, without luck. My companions waited quietly and seemed unperturbed by the situation while I became increasingly impatient, for I knew it was possible to construct rafts of balsa logs and to get across using makeshift guadua bamboo paddles. Several times I proposed to my companions that we should wait no longer for the water to recede but instead make rafts and paddle over to the other side. Repeatedly they declined to do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>Growing increasingly impatient, I finally challenged my companions, pointing out that they called themselves great warriors but were unwilling to cross the river. Without comment, they shortly constructed three balsa log rafts, and we prepared to make the crossing. The river was about 150 feet across, and the first raft, paddled by two of the Indians and carrying some of our baggage, made it to the other side. Then I went on the second raft with two paddlers. We made it about three-quarters of the way across and then were swept down into the rapids where the raft overturned, dumping us into the raging torrent. With extreme effort we were able to swim the remaining distance and survive. The third raft made it across.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we collected ourselves and rested before hiking farther, I remarked to them, &#x201c;That was a pretty close call. I guess we are lucky to be alive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was expecting some agreement, at least tacitly, but my companions silently remained standing there like stereotypes of stoical Indian warriors. They gave the impression that this had been nothing, acting completely unfazed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their lack of reaction perplexed me, because these were the same men who were reluctant to cross the river despite my urging. So I undiplomatically pointed out that they had not wanted to make the river crossing, and now they were acting as if it were nothing, even though they had been afraid to cross. <br>&nbsp;<br>They exchanged glances with each other but said nothing. Then one of them, whom I knew particularly well, finally replied. He said, &#x201c;Well, you see, we were not really afraid to cross the river because we cannot die. But we did not know about you!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At that moment, the perilous Amazon river crossing opened a door to important spiritual knowledge. After that I gradually learned from the Shuar that they were protected by spirit power against all forms of death except epidemic disease. I also learned that such power can leave one. Thus unprotected, people do indeed die. Therefore, before leaving on precarious missions, people watched for signs as to whether they still possessed the protective powers provided by their guardian spirits. If the signs were negative, they did not depart on such a mission, especially if it involved an attack on an enemy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the Shuar, indigenous shamans worldwide know that spirit power is basic to one&#x2019;s health, survival, and ability to heal others. Without this power, one is not resistant to illness or misfortune. In traditional shamanic cultures this awareness permeates the daily life of virtually everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jaime de Angulo, who spent time with the Atsugewe people of Northern California in the early twentieth century, said it well: &#x201c;Without power you cannot do anything out of the ordinary. With power you can do anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The power is like a force field that permeates the shaman and permits him or her to use the power to help and heal others. The shaman&#x2019;s idea of power is similar to our concept of energy, yet it includes more: energy as well as intelligence and self-confidence. Spiritual power is not political power or power over others. It is power essential to one&#x2019;s health and ability to survive.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Spirits</b><br>&nbsp;<br>At this point let me explain what I mean by a &#x201c;spirit.&#x201d; As I have said elsewhere, a spirit can be defined as &#x201c;an animate essence that has intelligence and different degrees of power, that is seen most easily in complete darkness and much less frequently in bright light, and in an altered state of consciousness better than an ordinary state. In fact, there is some question whether you can see it in an ordinary state of consciousness at all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, not all spirits have significant power. Those spirits that do are often referred to by shamanic peoples simply as &#x201c;powers.&#x201d; Particularly important in indigenous cultures are the guardian spirits that provide protective power to the people they love. When properly invoked by a shaman, such a power also provides active healing assistance for curing illness and pain in the shaman&#x2019;s patients. Through experience, the shaman has learned which spirits are powerful.<br>&nbsp;<br>Power is acquired in different ways. In Siberia and parts of South America it was common to gain personal power after suffering from a severe illness that put someone at death&#x2019;s door. If that person suddenly had a miraculous recovery, the local community concluded that a spirit had compassion for the person and interceded to relieve him or her of the illness. In such an event, people in the community typically would go to the revived and cured patient to see if the healing power could be used to help another individual suffering from a malady, usually a similar one. In other words, the suffering of the ill person could evoke pity by a spirit. In this way, a shaman sometimes was created.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Seeking Spirit Power </b><br>&nbsp;<br>Ideally, one should not wait to become ill to aspire to gain this power. Members of traditional shamanic cultures understood this well and encouraged young people in good health to suffer voluntarily in order that ancestral spirits might intervene to help them by sharing their power. Much more than a healing energy, this power was seen as a force that would support people in daily life, helping them to avoid misfortune and hardship, and to achieve good outcomes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most famously, this acquisition of power occurred in the power quest, more commonly called the &#x201c;vision quest.&#x201d; It should be mentioned, however, that not all successful power quests involved achieving visions. For example, among the Southern Okanagan the seeker might not see the spirit but instead receive its power through an auditory experience, such as a song and words.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most power quests were not something to be done by a sick person, but by one who was healthy and often relatively young. In a sense, it was a kind of spiritual life insurance to further an individual&#x2019;s success and survival.<br>&nbsp;<br>Spirit power could usually be sought by almost anyone in a variety of isolated places where ancestral and other guardians were known to reside. Such sites include mountaintops, the depths of a cave, a remote waterfall, the Arctic wilderness, particular canyons, local burial sites or ruins, a remote trail, and other locations. But one thing remained constant for success: the spirits had to be convinced that a power-seeking visitor to their haunts deserved help. When arriving at such a place, the visitor would usually sing or silently speak to the spirits there, asking for their assistance.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Suffering Voluntarily to Evoke Compassionate Help </b><br>&nbsp;<br>The quest took various forms. Regardless of culture, it commonly required seekers to prove themselves by suffering voluntarily, such as from fear, hunger, thirst, extreme cold or heat, and exhaustion. In shamanism, suffering is not a method of atoning for one&#x2019;s &#x201c;sins,&#x201d; but a way of attracting the help of powerful spirits.<br>&nbsp;<br>Among some Inuit of the Arctic, one way to have a successful quest for power was to spend four or five days in a special isolated igloo in the depths of winter without food or water. When the specified time elapsed, an elder, usually a shaman, opened the igloo and brought the person home. The igloo did not have even an oil lamp to heat it, so the suffering from extreme cold was combined with suffering from lack of water and food. It is reported that in some cases the person seeking power might be naked during this time of questing. A less life-challenging example is my own power quest among the Shuar that involved an exhausting climb up the forested eastern slopes of the Andes, a near-freezing bath below a waterfall, and no solid food allowed prior to obtaining a vision helped by the overwhelming power of datura (<i>Brugmansia </i>sp.) juice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Voluntary suffering for such power sometimes still occurs among Native American peoples of the Great Plains of North America, where the person seeking a vision and power typically first becomes dehydrated in the purification or &#x201c;sweat&#x201d; lodge. There the individual will intentionally suffer from the extreme heat and may even start becoming aware of spirit appearances and manifestations. Afterward, the seeker goes to an isolated mountaintop accompanied by a shaman-priest (medicine man) and/or other elders. The individual is left all alone for a prearranged number of days, and then the elders return to retrieve the person from the mountaintop.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the more extreme form of the Plains vision or power quest, the seeker would be wrapped in a blanket or quilt and placed in the ground in an L-shaped hole that had already been constructed and used previously. The vision seeker&#x2019;s sacred pipe was included. The hole would then be covered to reduce light so that the person would be better able to have visionary experiences both day and night, and to increase suffering through isolation, sensory deprivation, and cold. The suffering was heightened by not being allowed to drink water at any time after the sweat lodge or during the quest.<br>&nbsp;<br>The suffering is normally accompanied by praying to the ancestors, &#x201c;Have pity on me,&#x201d; usually addressing them as &#x201c;grandfathers&#x201d; since among indigenous peoples in the Upper Amazon and the North American Plains, &#x201c;grandfathers&#x201d; tends to be a gloss for all ancestors, because in many shamanic cultures there is no special word for ancestors. Once again, the suffering is intended to evoke compassion by the ancestral spirits so they may provide visionary experiences that bestow spiritual power on the supplicant. In revealing themselves, they may appear in either animal or human form.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why should those ancestor spirits provide help? The answer is really simple: when leaving ordinary reality at the time of death, they have chosen to remain here in the Middle World in order to help their genealogical descendants or allies of their descendants. When properly evoked, and convinced that a visitor deserves help, these spirits will reveal themselves in the forms the beings choose, communicate, and lend power to help the pilgrim overcome the difficulties and dangers of life. I often call them quasi-compassionate ethnocentric spirits, or simply ethnocentric spirits. Their protective compassion is conditional in two main ways: (1) they tend to help their descendants as long as they themselves are remembered and honored; and (2) they can be highly vengeful against those who threaten their descendants or allies of their descendants.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>[...] </b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>From <i>Cave and Cosmos: Shamanic Encounters with Spirits and Heavens </i>by Michael Harner, published by North Atlantic Books, copyright � 2013 by Michael Harner.

She knows because of all the crackerjack miracles still to be seen on this ruined globe. </p><p>Like those fish all disco-lit in the shallows. That was something, a marvel with no compare that she's been witness to. It was deep night when she saw it, but the moon was so bright it cast hard shadows everywhere on the island. So bright it was almost brighter than daytime because she could see things clearer, as if the sun were criminal to the truth, as if her eyes were eyes of night. She left the lighthouse and went down to the beach to look at the moon pure and straight, and she stood in the shallows and let her feet sink into the sand as the patter- waves tickled her ankles. And that's when she saw it, a school of tiny fish, all darting around like marbles in a chalk circle, and they were lit up electric, mostly silver but some gold and pink too. They came and danced around her ankles, and she could feel their little electric fish bodies, and it was like she was standing <i>under</i> the moon and <i>in</i> the moon at the same time. And that was something she hadn't seen before. A decade and a half, thereabouts, roaming the planet earth, and she's never seen that before. </p><p>And you could say the world has gone to black damnation, and you could say the children of Cain are holding sway over the good and the righteous&#x2014;but here's what Temple knows: She knows that whatever hell the world went to, and whatever evil she's perpetrated her own self, and whatever series of cursed misfortunes brought her down here to this island to be harbored away from the order of mankind, well, all those things are what put her there that night to stand amid the Daylight Moon and the Miracle of the Fish&#x2014;which she wouldn't of got to see otherwise. </p><p>See, God is a slick god. He makes it so you don't miss out on nothing you're supposed to witness firsthand. </p><p>She sleeps in an abandoned lighthouse at the top of a bluff. At the base there's a circular room with a fireplace where she cooks fish in a blackened iron pot. The first night she discovered the hatch in the floor that opened into a dank storage room. There she found candles, fishhooks, a first aid kit, a fl are gun with a box of oxidized rounds. She tried one, but it was dead. </p><p>In the mornings she digs for pignuts in the underbrush and checks her nets for fish. She leaves her sneakers in the lighthouse, she likes the feel of the hot sand on the soles of her feet. The Florida beachgrass between her toes. The palm trees are like bushes in the air, their brittle dead fronds like a skirt of bones around the tall trunks, rattling in the breeze. </p><p>At noon every day, she climbs the spiral stairs to the top of the signal tower, pausing at the middle landing to catch her breath and feel the sun on her face from the grimy window. At the top, she walks the catwalk once around&#x2014;gazing out over the illimitable sea, and then, toward the mainland coast, the rocky cusp of the blight continent. Sometimes she stops to look at the inverted hemisphere of the light itself, that blind glass optic, like a cauldron turned on its side and covered with a thousand square mirrors. </p><p>She can see her reflection there, clear and multifarious. An army of her. </p><p>Afternoons, she looks through the unrotted magazines she'd found lining some boxes of kerosene. The words mean nothing to her, but the pictures she likes. They evoke places she has never been&#x2014;crowds of the sharply dressed hailing the arrival of someone in a long black car, people in white suits reclining on couches in homes where there's no blood crusted on the walls, women in undergarments on backdrops of seamless white. Abstract heaven, that white&#x2014;where could such a white exist? If she had all the white paint left in the world, what would go untouched by her brush? She closes her eyes and thinks about it. </p><p>It can be cold at night. She keeps the fire going and pulls her army jacket tighter around her torso and listens to the ocean wind whistling loud through the hollow flute of her tall home. </p><p>Miracle, or augury maybe&#x2014;because the morning after the glowing fish, she finds the body on the beach. She sees it during her morning walk around the island to check the nets, she finds it on the north point of the teardrop landmass, near the shoal. </p><p>At first it is a black shape against the white sand, and she studies it from a distance, measures it with her fingers up to her eye. </p><p>Too small to be a person, unless it's folded double or half buried. Which it could be. </p><p>She looks around. The wind blowing through the grass above the shore makes a peaceful sound. </p><p>She sits and studies the thing and waits for movement. </p><p>The shoal is bigger today. It keeps getting bigger. When she first came, the island seemed like a long way off from the mainland. She swam to it, using an empty red and white cooler to help keep her afloat in the currents. That was months ago. Since then the island has gotten bigger, the season pulling the water out farther and farther every night, drawing the island closer to the mainland. There is a spit of reefy rock extending out from the shore of the mainland and pointing toward the island, and there are large fragments of jutting coral reaching in the other direction from the island. Like the fingers of God and Adam, and each day they come closer to touching as the water retreats and gets shallower along the shoal. </p><p>But it still seems safe. The breakers on the reef are violent and thunderous. You wouldn't be able to get across the shoal without busting yourself to pieces on the rock. Not yet at least. </p><p>The shape doesn't move, so she stands and approaches it carefully. </p><p>It's a man, buried facedown in the sand, the tail of his flannel shirt whipping back and forth in the wind. There's something about the way his legs are arranged, one knee up by the small of his back, that tells her his back is broken. There's sand in his hair, and his fingernails are torn and blue. </p><p>She looks around again. Then she raises her foot and pokes the man's back with her toe. Nothing happens so she pokes him again, harder. </p><p>That's when he starts squirming. </p><p>There are muffled sounds coming from his throat, strained grunts and growls&#x2014;frustration and pathos rather than suffering or pain. His arms begin to sweep the sand as if to make an angel. And there's a writhing, rippling movement that goes through the muscles of his body, as of a broken toy twitching with mechanical repetition, unable to right itself. </p><p>Meatskin, she says aloud. </p><p>One of the hands catches at her ankle, but she kicks it off. </p><p>She sits down beside him and leans back on her hands and braces her feet up against the torso and pushes the body so that it flips over faceup, leaving a crooked, wet indentation in the sand. </p><p>One arm is still flailing, but the other is caught under his back so she stays on that side of him and kneels over his exposed face. </p><p>The jaw is missing altogether, along with one of the eyes. The face is blistered black and torn. A flap of skin on the cheekbone is pulled back and pasted with wet sand, revealing the yellow white of bone and cartilage underneath. The place where the eye was is now a mushy soup of thick clear fluid mixed with blood, like ketchup eggs. There's a string of kelp sticking out of the nose that makes him look almost comical&#x2014;as though someone has played a practical joke on him. </p><p>But the rightness of his face is distorted by the missing mandible. Even revolting things can be made to look whole if there is a symmetry to them&#x2014; but with the jaw gone, the face looks squat and the neck looks absurdly equine. </p><p>She moves her fingers back and forth before his one good eye, and the eye rolls around in its socket trying to follow the movement but stuttering in its focus. Then she puts her fingers down where the mouth would be. He has a set of upper teeth, cracked and brittle, but nothing beneath to bite down against. When she puts her fingers there, she can see the tendons tucked in behind his teeth clicking away in a radial pattern. There are milky white bones jutting out where the mandible would be attached and yellow ligaments like rubber bands stretching and relaxing, stretching and relaxing, with the ghost motion of chewing. </p><p>What you gonna do? she says. Bite me? I think your biting days are gone away, mister. </p><p>She takes her hand from his face and sits back, looking at him. </p><p>He gets his head shifted in her direction and keeps squirming. </p><p>Stop fightin against yourself, she says. Your back's broke. You ain't going nowhere. This is just about the end of your days. </p><p>She sighs and casts a gaze over the rocky shoal in the distance, the wide flat mainland beyond. </p><p>What'd you come here for anyway, meatskin? she says. Did you smell some girlblood carried on the wind? Did you just have to have some? I know you didn't swim here. Too slow and stupid for that. </p><p>There is a gurgle in his throat and a blue crab bursts out from the sandy exposed end of the windpipe and scurries away. </p><p>You know what I think? she says. I think you tried to climb across those rocks. And I think you got picked up by those waves and got bust apart pretty good. That's what I think. What do you say about that? </p><p>He has worked the arm free from underneath him and reaches toward her. But the fingers fall short by inches and dig furrows in the sand. </p><p>Well, she says, you shoulda been here last night. There was a moon so big you could just about reach up and pluck it out of the sky. And these fish, all electriclike, buzzing in circles round my ankles. It was something else, mister. I'm telling you, a miracle if ever there was one. </p><p>She looks at the rolling eye and the shuddering torso. </p><p>Maybe you ain't so interested in miracles. But still and all, you can cherish a miracle without <i>deserving</i> one. We're all of us beholden to the beauty of the world, even the bad ones of us. Maybe the bad ones most of all. </p><p>She sighs, deep and lo...</p></p><h2>Mandragola</h2><p>A superior treatment of Machiavelli&#39;s minor masterpiece! Flaumenhaft&#39;s beautifully crafted, literal translation aims to capture the original intent of the playwright. Machiavelli himself distinguished carefully between translations and revisions; thus, Flaumenhaft finds a faithful translation essential to conveying Machiavelli&#39;s thought and to allowing direct access to the work. The Prologue explores the relationship between Machiavelli&#39;s stage comedies--part of the Comedia Erudita of the Italian Renaissance--and his political books. Mandragola focuses on the interplay between personal and political ethics, a major theme throughout his works. The translation includes helpful notes that clarify allusions, language, and context. Names of characters and places, titles and forms of address, and some familiar Italian words and phrases remain in Italian. Passages in Latin, as well as idioms, are reproduced in the notes.</p><p>Consider these Machiavelli translations also available from Waveland Press: Clizia (ISBN 9780881339024) and The Prince (ISBN 9780881334449).Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Lady Carliss and the Waters of Moorue (The Knights of Arrethtrae)</h2><p><b>Lady Carliss faces the challenge of her life.

He has received praise from parents across the country for his unique approach to telling biblical truths. His passion in life is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and to love his wife, Andrea, and their six children. He lives with his family in North Dakota.<b>Lady Carliss</b><br>&nbsp;<br>She seemed an ordinary enough girl on the outside&#x2014;a quiet, plain, and simple girl&#x2014;but within, Carliss was as unique and complex as the snowflakes that sometimes fell upon her father&#x2019;s farm when she was a child. On those special days, Carliss would take a dark cloth outside and catch the intricate flakes so she could gaze upon them and marvel at their perfection and beauty. She would close her eyes before they melted and try to hold each exquisite detail in her memory for as long as possible.<br>&nbsp;<br>As she grew out of the delightful and carefree world of a child and into the reality of the kingdom, Carliss began to realize that just as the beauty of her perfect flakes had melted away, so had the perfection of the kingdom where she lived. In her spirit, she knew something was amiss, and this is what made Carliss so unusual. She ached for something she knew did not exist and yet believed it should.<br>&nbsp;<br>This yearning was something she could not quench, and it stole away the silliness of youth before her time.Those who knew her thought her a bit peculiar, a bit too intense and serious&#x2014;certainly not like the other girls. But then, Carliss had never aspired to be like the other girls. What she did aspire to was something she couldn&#x2019;t quite name&#x2014;until<br>the day her world changed.<br>&nbsp;<br>It happened when Carliss was fifteen. A man dressed in the garb of a knight arrived at their farm. He was quite short and unimpressive in appearance. He asked for room and board for a night, and he offered to pay a good price in exchange.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss&#x2019;s father hesitated, for he had learned to be wary of all men in a kingdom where treachery was as likely as a good deed. Carliss knew her father was concerned for the safety of her mother and the five children, but she sensed something noble in this man&#x2019;s peculiarity.<br>&nbsp;<br>When her father denied the knight&#x2019;s request, Carliss felt the ache in her spirit swell to the size of a chasm that seemed to swallow her. She watched the fellow turn and leave the farm. But when he was a short distance away, Carliss could not contain herself. She ran after the man, ignoring the warning calls from her father and mother.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who are you, sir,&#x201d; she panted when she reached him, &#x201c;and why did you come here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The knight gazed down at Carliss from his steed and seemed to know the ache that called her to him. &#x201c;I am Sir Orland, a Knight of the Prince, and I come to share His truth with you. Would you like to hear it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the day Sir Orland shared the great story of the King and the Prince with Carliss and her family. By evening, another family had been added to the Prince&#x2019;s cause, and &nbsp;Carliss felt the ache in her spirit fade away. She closed her eyes and envisioned her perfect snowflakes in a perfect kingdom with a perfect King. Joy filled her heart, and so did her zeal for service to the Prince.<br>&nbsp;<br>On that day, Carliss became Lady Carliss, noble daughter of the King. She and her family donned robes of a nobility that far transcended the caste nobility of the kingdom. Sir Orland also opened their eyes to realities both glorious and potentially frightening. For as the King and His Son transformed in their minds from myth and legend to reality, so did the King&#x2019;s enemy, Lucius, and the ongoing battle for the kingdom...a battle in which they now had a significant role.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the course of the next two years, Sir Orland found many opportunities to come and train the family in the ways of the Prince and in the sword. Then, when Carliss was &nbsp;&nbsp;nearly seventeen, she and her brother Koen began training at a nearby haven for the Knights of the Prince. Carliss was commissioned a year after Koen, and her father&nbsp; arranged to have her mentored for a time under Sir Orland.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, at the age of twenty, Carliss was truly a knight of great skill by her own right. By the kingdom&#x2019;s standard, she was still a quiet, plain, and simple girl. On matters of the King and the Prince, however, a fiery spirit rose up strong within her. It is what drove her to defend the meek and help the hurting and battle with all her might against the servants of the Dark Knight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her mettle as a Knight of the Prince had been tested just weeks before, when she helped Koen and his friend Sir Dalton defeat the evil Lord Drox. Together they had fought the terrifying four-winged death ravens and the ravenous hounds of despair and had freed many knights from Drox&#x2019;s horrific prison. The three of them had grown close on that mission, and it was then that Carliss began to struggle with feelings for Dalton.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was what troubled her on a brilliant summer day as she rode her horse, Rindy, along the road to Salisburg.<br>&nbsp;<br>How was it possible, she wondered, to want so much to see someone...and yet dread it at the same time?<br>&nbsp;<br>And why did it all have to be so complicated?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lady Carliss,&#x201d; a voice called out from behind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss turned about on Rindy to see a young woman galloping to catch her. Carliss reined in her horse and waited. She had only been on the road a short time, having just left the haven at Varlaken.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss had come to Varlaken with a contingent of fellow knights to help retrain those who had been imprisoned by Lord Drox. She had worked tirelessly for the past two-and-a-half weeks to reestablish the hearts and hone the skills of those men and women recently freed from Drox&#x2019;s dreadful cave prison.The immensity of the daily tasks at Varlaken had kept her mind occupied, and the weariness of each day had pulled at her limbs and mind at sundown. In the quietness of the evenings, however, she had been unable to avoid the honest tugging of her heart in a direction she desperately sought to avoid.<br>&nbsp;<br>So now she was headed for home...and Sir Dalton. Her thoughts of him confused her, and she welcomed the interruption of her ride.<br>&nbsp;<br>The young woman slowed her horse and smiled broadly at Carliss as she approached. Carliss recognized the short, dark hair. It was a young knight named Salina.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;May I ride with you for a distance?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although Lady Salina was a couple of years older, Carliss had mentored and befriended her while at Varlaken. She was a beautiful woman who had fallen prey to the same deceptions of Lord Drox that so many other knights had.When Carliss, Koen, and Sir Dalton, along with the help of Sir Orland, freed Drox&#x2019;s prisoners, Salina had immediately attached herself to Carliss.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss, who didn&#x2019;t have many female friends, had liked Salina from the beginning. She seemed like a strong knight, and Carliss was impressed with how quickly she recovered from life in Drox&#x2019;s prison. Her warm brown eyes often seemed to reflect a mind that was deep in thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad for the company,&#x201d; Carliss told her now with a smile. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize you were leaving Varlaken just yet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Salina matched her horse&#x2019;s gait to Carliss&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Once you left I didn&#x2019;t see much need to stay,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m ready to move on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss nodded. &#x201c;I think so too. You did very well at sword practice yesterday.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not as well as you did at archery,&#x201d; Salina answered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re incredibly skilled with a bow, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss flashed a quick smile. &#x201c;I guess I have a knack for it. I hunted a lot on our farm when I was growing up.&#x201d; Salina tilted her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than just a knack. I was in Drox&#x2019;s prison, remember. I saw how you used your bow against those awful hounds&#x2014;it was almost as if you knew where they were going to be before they got there. You&#x2019;re quite a knight for one so young.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I only hope to serve my King.&#x201d; Carliss ducked her head. &#x201c;So, you are going home now?&#x201d; she asked, anxious to change the subject. Salina shrugged. &#x201c;For a while, I guess, though I hope to receive another assignment soon. You&#x2019;re heading back to Salisburg?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss nodded. &#x201c;My family is there. My parents and my siblings.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Salina gave her a teasing smile. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that where Sir Dalton is from as well?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes...yes he is,&#x201d; Carliss replied, feeling her face flush slightly. She turned to adjust her saddle pack. &#x201c;Sir Dalton&#x2019;s a courageous knight,&#x201d; she answered carefully. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good friend, especially to my brother, Koen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Salina tilted her head toward Carliss. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all? I thought perhaps you and he&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; Carliss worked to keep her voice even. &#x201c;Sir Dalton has an...understanding with Lady Brynn.We were all in training together.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Salina nodded thoughtfully as they picked up their pace to pass a precariously loaded cart. Once they were safely past, she glanced over at Carliss.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Listen, do you remember when my brother visited me at the haven last week?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Yes, I think so.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, he was so grateful for how you were helping me, and he didn&#x2019;t get a chance to thank you in person.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Salina gave Carliss another meaningful glance, and Carliss shifted in her saddle, wondering where this was leading. Sir Alston had arrived at a time when Carliss was feeling overwhelmed with her duties. He had only stayed a day, and she had seen him a few times with Salina but never actually talked with him. Carliss was perfectly fine with that, for he was a handsome fellow, and such men tended to make her feel uneasy...as Dalton had.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m saying is...I would love for you to come to my home and meet my family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not far, Carliss, just a short ride north of here near Pembrook,&#x201d; Salina continued. &#x201c;I owe you so much, and I know that Alston and my parents would love to have an opportunity to thank you properly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss pretended to consider the request out of courtesy, fully intending to decline. But Salina persisted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please, Carliss. It would mean so much to me. At least come and share a meal with us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss looked at Salina and couldn&#x2019;t think of any reasonable excuse. Her family wasn&#x2019;t expecting her on any particular day. Besides, truth be told, she had been dreading her return home, for she knew she would have to face her own emotional dilemma at the haven there. Perhaps this diversion would help clear her mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;All right, Salina. I&#x2019;ll come,&#x201d; Carliss said with a smile. &#x201c;But only for a little while. Thank you for the invitation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wonderful!&#x201d; Salina exclaimed. &#x201c;They will all be so excited to meet you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Carliss ducked her head again, embarrassed at Salina&#x2019;s exuberant response.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s off toward Pembrook then,&#x201d; she said, wondering if she had just committed to something she might later regret.</p><h2>Trip: Psychedelics, Alienation, and Change</h2><p><p> <strong>Part memoir, part history, part journalistic expos�, <em>Trip</em> is a look at psychedelic drugs, literature, and alienation from one of the twenty-first century's most innovative novelists--<em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em> for a new generation. A Vintage Original.</strong> </p> <p> While isolating himself to work on his novel <em>Taipei,</em> Tao Lin discovered the prolific work of Terence McKenna--the leading advocate of psychotropic drugs since Timothy Leary. Tao became obsessed with McKenna, whose worldview (and particular theory of drug use) seemed to present an alternate way of being. In <em>Trip,</em> Tao's first ever book-length work of nonfiction, he explores parallels between McKenna's life and his own in a far-reaching search for answers to looming questions: Why do we make art? What is language for? And are there essential, universal truths out there, beyond our limited range of perception? </p> <p> <em>Trip</em> takes readers on a trip through psychedelic culture, from D.A.R.E. to Aldous Huxley, from NYU's Bobst Library to a plant-drawing class in Santa Rosa, California. Drawing on first-person exploratory journalism as well as in-depth research, Tao details the experience of taking psilocybin, DMT, and cannabis, studies their chemical composure and legality, and ends his story with a pilgrimage out West, where he communes with McKenna's ex-wife and fellow "ethnobotanist," Kathleen Harrison. </p></p><p>Tao Lin is the author of the novels <i>Taipei</i> and <i>Richard Yates</i> and <i>Eeeee Eee Eeee</i>, the novella <i>Shoplifting from American Apparel</i>, the story collection <i>Bed</i>, and the poetry collections <i>cognitive-behavioral therapy</i> and <i>you are a little bit happier than i am</i>. He was born in Virginia, has taught in Sarah Lawrence College's MFA program, and is the founder and editor of Muumuu House.<p> &#x201c;<em>Trip</em> is, if not a guide to self-help, a book about a person trying to be happier, in part by changing the kinds of drugs he uses. . .another theory of psychedelics emerges, which suggests that the most mystical revelations concern earthly themes: birth, death, and the body; family, friends, and love.&#x201d; &#x2014;Emily Witt, <em>The New Yorker</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>Trip</em> is a sane book about becoming sane, and Lin&#x2019;s most valuable work to date.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>The Irish Times</em> </p> <p> <em>"</em>[Lin does] an incredible job describing what a psychedelic experience feels like." &#x2014;<em>The Village Voice</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;An immediately significant entry in the literature of derangement and recovery.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Vulture</em>, &#x201c;The Best Books of the Year (So Far)&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;[Lin&#x2019;s] best yet. . . .

This book has changed how I understand myself on a cellular level. It's a superbly researched, moving, and formally inventive quest for re-enchantment, and Tao Lin's most compelling and profound book yet.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sheila Heti, author of <em>How Should a Person Be?</em> </p> <p> "<em>Trip</em> transcends the ranks of drug memoirs to give us a characteristically nontraditional, completely unique, hilarious, tender, and at times frightening departure from everyday life such as only Tao Lin can write. With fascinating specificity, it asks essential questions about the nature of time, reality, consciousness, and the self, while holding a looking glass up to contemporary life, to ask, Is this really all there is?&#x2014;and to answer, No, the possibility for knowledge is endless, and we should never cease searching." &#x2014;Sarah Gerard, author of <em>Sunshine State</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;Similar to the psychedelic drugs Tao Lin writes about here, this book introduces new ways to consider language, perception, and recovery. It&#x2019;s a joy to watch Lin interrogate his obsessions so earnestly and thoroughly in an attempt to understand more about the world as he knows it. <em>Trip</em> is a book for anyone interested in learning about what the human mind is capable of seeing and believing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Chelsea Hodson, author of <em>Tonight I&#x2019;m Someone Else</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;Tao Lin took all the drugs so that we wouldn&#x2019;t have to, and the result is astonishing, mind-expanding, beautiful, and profound. The whole of humanity seems contained in this one book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kristen Iskandrian, author of <em>Motherest</em> </p> <p> &#x201c;Tao Lin&#x2019;s writing reliably restores my sense of the inexhaustible strangeness of even one minute of human thought and feeling.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael W.

This is a complete introductory course in Celtic Druidism, packaged within the framework of 21 authentic and expanded folk story / lessons that read like a novel.</p></p><p>There is a great deal that has been written about the ancient Celts. This is especially true among the Pagan community because many find that the myths and legends of the Celts strike a chord that rings true. <br>Sometimes, however, it is possible to see things backwards. By that I mean that because you do something a particular way today, you assume that the ancients did it either the same way or in a similar fashion. Ah, if only it were so! <br>That simply isn't good history. You have to get good information, not make assumptions. That's why I am very enthused with Douglas Monroe's <i>The 21 Lessons of Merlyn. <br></i>When you read this book you will see that it was written by a person who is both a scholar and a bard. He instructs by way of stories, making the purpose and method of the philosophies, exercises, and magical rituals crystal clear and easy to apply, yet not limiting his brilliant research and scholarship. In fact, the teachings in this book are based on a manuscript which is now in the private collection of the Albion Lodge of the United Ancient Order of Druids of Oxford. <br>One of the things I really like is the traditional Druid triads, concepts that are broken down into thee short sentences. For example, the Three Virtues of Wisdom are to be aware of all things, to endure all things, and to be removed from all things. The three spiritual instructors of mankind are mastery of self, master of world, and mastery of unknown. You'll learn many of these and be able to discover how they are spiritually and practically meaningful in your life. <br>There is so much great material in this book that I can't say enough about it! Already, more than 120,000 people are using this book. If you want to find out what the Druids really did, and put it to use in your life, get this book. <br> <br>Douglas Monroe has been involved in practical Earth magick since his first apprenticeship at age 10. As a boy , he studied classical Magic under the guidance of Israel Regardie, and has studied and taught in the United States, in Britain, and in Argentina. He is founder of the New Forest Centre for Magickal Studies and has made many excursions to Celtic Britain to collect original materials on Druidism and Arthurian Lore. His Method of teaching - here seemingly presented as tales of magic and adventure - has many precedents in the Wisdom Teachings of the East and West, but most truly in the Druidic Tradition that he has followed, and of which he is a foremost exponent.</p><h2>The Ancient Near Eastern World (The World in Ancient Times)</h2><p>What do the wheel, the law, and belief in a single god have in common?

This is an account of the world's greatest �intellectual virtuosos,' who are also humanity's greatest doubters and disbelievers, from the ancient Greek philosophers, Jesus, and the Eastern religions, to modern secular equivalents Marx, Freud and Darwin�and their attempts to reconcile the seeming meaninglessness of the universe with the human need for meaning, </p> <p> This remarkable book ranges from the early Greeks, Hebrew figures such as Job and Ecclesiastes, Eastern critical wisdom, Roman stoicism, Jesus as a man of doubt, Gnosticism and Christian mystics, medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian skeptics, secularism, the rise of science, modern and contemporary critical thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, the existentialists. </p></p><p><p>Jennifer Michael Hecht is a philosopher, historian, and award-winning poet. She is the author of <em>Doubt: A History</em> and <em>The End of the Soul</em>; the latter won the Phi Beta Kappa Society's 2004 Ralph Waldo Emerson Award. Hecht's books of poetry include <em>The Next Ancient World</em> and <em>Funny</em>. She earned her Ph.D. in history from Columbia University and teaches at The New School in New York City.</p>Shifting between the views of the religious believer and the agnostic questioner, Hecht takes the listener on a journey into the history of doubt from the Greeks to the present. Martha Pardee&#39;s measured pacing lends clarity to the complex subject. She graces this nonfiction work with her firm, reflective tones, her sense of humor, and her wonder at the passionate seekers of truth she is describing. Challengers throughout history have attempted to reconcile the seeming meaninglessness of the universe with humanity&#39;s need for significance. Hecht&#39;s witty prose coupled with Pardee&#39;s expressive narration produces an accessible presentation about skepticism and the intellectual discovery it can lead to.

Angie DeLaura asked her.<br><br> "No, just yours," Mel said, then she smiled. "For now."<br><br> They'd been best friends since they were twelve years old, so it was no surprise that Mel would be Angie's maid of honor when Angie and their other childhood friend Tate Harper tied the knot in just one week.<br><br> Today, Mel and Angie had left Fairy Tale Cupcakes, the bakery they co-owned, in the capable hands of their employees while they ran around town, finalizing payments to vendors and making sure everything was a go for Angie and Tate's big day. At the moment, they were paying for Angie's flowers, calla lilies, with their stems wrapped in aqua and pewter ribbons.<br><br> "Annabelle? Hello!" Angie called. She rang the bell on the counter and peered at the back room. "What do you suppose is keeping her?"<br><br> "No idea," Mel said. She admired the brilliant yellow petals on a huge sunflower. So pretty.<br><br> "Okay, so after we pay the florist, who's next?" Angie asked.<br><br> Mel put the snapdragons back in their display bucket and checked her smartphone, where she kept her to-do list updated.<br><br> "We need to pay the photographer and the caterer." She glanced at Angie. "Are you really having them make Jell-O? 'Because cr me br l e can never be Jell-O'."<br><br> "'I have to be Jell-O,'" Angie said. For emphasis, she tossed her long, curly brown hair over her shoulder.<br><br> "My Best Friend's Wedding," they identified the movie quotes together and then laughed.<br><br> Since middle school, the three friends, Mel, Angie, and Tate, had shared a love of sweets and movies. Now as adults they tried to stump one another with random movie quotes, and in the case of serving Jell-O at their wedding, Angie chose it deliberately. She wanted Tate to know she was his comfort food, his Jell-O, which he had always loved, much to Mel's cordon bleu dismay.<br><br> "Do you think we should leave and come back?" Angie asked Mel. "Maybe she's on her coffee break and forgot to lock the door."<br><br> "Maybe." Mel frowned. She didn't want to admit she was starting to get a hinky feeling in the pit of her stomach.<br><br> Annabelle Martin's flower shop sat in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Despite the small size of the space, it was full to bursting with blooms, both real and silk, as Annabelle's talent with flowers was legendary. In Scottsdale, Arizona, a wedding was just not a wedding unless Annabelle did the flowers.<br><br> "But even if Annabelle stepped out, why isn't anyone else here? Doesn't she have four assistants?" Mel asked.<br><br> Angie nodded and Mel saw her big brown eyes get wide and Mel knew she was thinking the same thing that Mel was. Angie swallowed and in a soft voice, she said, "Maybe something happened to her?"<br><br> They stared at each other for a moment. Over the past few years, they had suffered the misfortune of stumbling upon several dead bodies. Given that Angie was one week from saying "I do," it would just figure if they found a body now.<br><br> "This can't be happening," Angie said. "Not now."<br><br> "Don't panic," Mel said. She blew her blond bangs off her forehead. Being a chef, she kept her hair nice and short to keep it out of the food, because nothing said "Ew" like finding a hair in your frosting.<br><br> "Don't panic?" Angie cried, her voice rising a decibel with each syllable. "Why would I panic? It's only a week until my wedding, you know, the most important day of my life to date."<br><br> "Breathe." Mel squeezed Angie's arm as she scooted past her and around the counter. "I'll just check in back and make sure everything is okay."<br><br> A curtain was hanging in the doorway to the back room. She knew from being here before that the back room housed all of Annabelle's supplies as well as a kitchenette and her office. It was a tiny space and she had to turn sideways to maneuver through the packed shelves.<br><br> Vases of glass, steel, and copper; baskets; ribbons; glass marbles; florist wire in all sizes and colors-all of it-was stuffed onto the shelves until they looked as if they'd regurgitate the goods right onto the floor.<br><br> Mel shimmied her way past until she cleared the shelves and reached the worktable in back. A couple dozen purple irises were scattered across a sheaf of floral paper as if someone had just left them out of water and gasping for air.<br><br> Annabelle loved flowers; they were her passion. Mel couldn't imagine that she'd have just left these here to rot. Mel felt the short-cropped hair on the back of her neck prickle with unease.<br><br> Where was Annabelle? What could have happened to her? Mel closed her eyes for a moment, trying to dredge up the courage to circle the table and see if Annabelle was there, lying on the floor, unconscious, bludgeoned, bloody, bleeding out even as Mel stood here shaking like a 'fraidy cat.<br><br> "Hello? Annabelle? Are you here?" Mel called.<br><br> There was no answer. She opened her eyes. She was just going to have to see for herself. She took a steadying breath and stepped around the worktable. She glanced at the floor. It was bare. The breath she'd been holding burst out of her lungs as the sound of a toilet flushing broke through the quiet.<br><br> Mel whipped around to face the back hallway just as Angie came barreling through the curtain into the back room.<br><br> "Any sign of her?" she asked.<br><br> "Maybe," Mel said. She stared down the hallway, listening to the water running in the bathroom. Please, please, please, let it be . . .<br><br> "Well, doesn't that just figure?" Annabelle asked as she strode towards them. "It's quiet all morning and then the second you go to the bathroom someone shows up."<br><br> "You're okay!" Mel cried. Impulsively, she threw herself at Annabelle's big-boned frame and hugged her tight. "You're not dead."<br><br> "Oh, honey." Annabelle hugged her back. "You need to calm down, maybe take a vacation or something."<br><br> Mel let her go with a nervous laugh. "Ha, you're right. I must be working too hard."<br><br> Annabelle fluffed her close-cropped curls and then turned to Angie with a hug and a smile. "And how is our bride? Seven days to go! Are you ready?"<br><br> "More than," Angie said. "I'm excited for the wedding but I'm even more excited to have it over and be Mrs. Tate Harper."<br><br> Annabelle clasped her hands over her heart and sighed. "Of all the events I arrange flowers for, weddings are my favorite. Yours aren't here yet, but come on, I'll show you what I just got in."<br><br> Annabelle scooped up the irises and put them in water and then led them to the front of the shop. While she and Angie oohed and aahed over some of the fresh flowers, Mel took a moment to get herself together. Clearly she had some issues if her first thought when Annabelle hadn't been available was that she was dead. Seriously, what was wrong with her?<br><br> She had been around an inordinate amount of death over the past few years. She wondered if perhaps it was her own fault. Maybe she found all of these bodies, maybe bad things happened all around her, because she went looking for them. The thought disturbed Mel on a lot of levels.<br><br> "Did that daisy do something to offend you?" Annabelle asked.<br><br> Mel looked at her in question and Annabelle pointed to Mel's hands, where just the stem and one petal were left of an orange gerbera daisy. Mel had been systematically stripping the petals off of it without realizing.<br><br> Snatching off the last petal, Mel said, "He loves me. Phew!"<br><br> Angie looked at her as if she thought Mel was drunk or crazy or drunk and crazy. Mel shrugged. Annabelle gave her a concerned look and took the stem out of her hands and threw it in the trash.<br><br> While Angie paid Annabelle for her flowers, Mel picked up the petals and then paced up by the front of the shop. She didn't trust herself not to destroy any of the lovely arrangements and kept her hands in her pockets just in case.<br><br> With a wave, they left Annabelle and her flowers to head to the photographer's studio. It was across Scottsdale Road, on a small side street, nestled in amongst the trendy restaurants and art galleries.<br><br> "Okay, what gives?" Angie asked as soon as the door shut behind them.<br><br> "What?" Mel asked.<br><br> Angie widened her eyes and said, "Come on, you know what. You started shredding flowers in there. What was that all about?"<br><br> "Nothing. I just had this random thought," Mel said. "It was silly."<br><br> "Good, then you won't mind sharing."<br><br> Mel pursed her lips. Angie was a badger. There was no way she was getting out of this.<br><br> "Fine, if you must know-"<br><br> "I must."<br><br> They paused at the corner to wait for the crossing light.<br><br> "I just thought it was weird that my first instinct when Annabelle wasn't readily available was that she'd been murdered. I mean that's weird, right?"<br><br> Angie squinted at her. "There's more, isn't there?"<br><br> Mel blew out a breath. "Okay, it also occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, the fact that I am always looking for something bad to have happened is what makes it happen."<br><br> The light turned and the walk signal lit up. Angie opened her mouth to speak, closed it, then took Mel's arm and pulled her across the street.<br><br> Once they stepped onto the curb, she looked at Mel and said, "Now, that is nuts."<br><br> "Is it?" Mel asked. "I mean, isn't there a whole philosophy that says whatever you put out there comes back to you?"<br><br> "So, you think that by putting out thoughts of dead bodies or worst-case scenarios, that's what makes them happen?"<br><br> "Yeah . . . maybe . . . no . . . I don't know."<br><br> "Listen, we've definitely had some crazy stuff happen to us since we opened the bakery, but don't you think it's because we work in a service industry with a whole lot of different people with all sorts of bad and good things happening in their lives?" Angie asked. "I mean, how many weddings, birthdays, retirement parties, etcetera, have we baked cupcakes for and nothing bad has happened? Quite the opposite, in fact-the person has had the greatest day ever."<br><br> She began walking and Mel fell into step beside her.<br><br> "You're right," she said. "Maybe I just have a little post-traumatic stress going because the bad when it's bad is so very bad."<br><br> Angie nodded. "I'm sure that's it, but since my wedding is coming up in a matter of days, why don't we hedge our bets, and you just keep picturing happy things in that head of yours."<br><br> "Like puppies and kittens?"<br><br> "Yeah, or go big with unicorns and glitter bombs," Angie suggested.<br><br> Mel laughed. Angie was right. She needed to chillax. Probably, she was just nervous about the wedding. She was maid of honor, after all, which carried a lot of responsibility. Not that she thought Angie would pull a runner, but it was Mel's job to get her to the church on time, dressed appropriately, and to be prepared to crack some skulls if anyone interfered with her best friend's wedding.<br><br> "Okay, glittery unicorns it is," Mel said.<br><br> "That's my girl." Angie paused in front of the photographer's studio, pulling out her phone to check the time. Mel glanced over her shoulder and noted that they were right on schedule. Excellent.<br><br> Blaise Ione, the photographer, was a friend of Tate's from his days in the high school marching band. After graduation, Blaise had gone to art school and lived in New York City for several years, but when his aging mother needed him, he'd come home to Scottsdale to be nearby.<br><br> Blaise was a hardcore hipster and wore his short hair bleached white and paired it with his large Andy Warhol glasses, striped skinny pants, and pointy-toed shoes. He was exuberant, enthusiastic, and always made Mel laugh. She knew the wedding was safe in Blaise's hands.<br><br> Although it was a small space, Blaise made the most of it with huge portraits decorating the black walls, and mid-century modern furniture that made a statement as well as being a place to sit. Through the window, Mel studied one of the chairs, which looked to be molded out of cement. The statement she got was, This is uncomfortable, so move along, which, knowing Blaise, was exactly what he wanted it to say.<br><br> Angie pulled open the door and a gong sounded somewhere in the back of the space. Leave it to Blaise to have an unconventional door chime.<br><br> "Blaise? Hello?" Angie called out.<br><br> Mel moved towards the wall to study the portraits. Blaise had done Tate and Angie's engagement pictures and they were spectacular, managing to capture the longtime friendship that had morphed into romantic love between the couple.<br><br> Mel's favorite shot had been taken in black-and-white in an old movie theater. In it, Tate and Angie were sharing a bucket of popcorn, the red and white stripes on the bucket the only pop of color in the photo, as they gazed at each other with all the love in their hearts. It made Mel water up every time she saw it.<br><br> Oh, and here it was on the wall! Blaise had added it to his display. Mel felt her throat get tight.<br><br> "Hey, I didn't know he was going to put that up," Angie said as she joined her. "That's my favorite."<br><br> "Mine, too," Mel said. "Wow, it keeps hitting me that in a few days you'll be married to Tate."<br><br> "I know, right?" Angie grinned. "Say it again, it makes me dizzy."<br><br> "In a few days you'll be married to Tate." Mel laughed and hugged her friend close. "I am so happy for you both."<br><br> "Thanks," Angie said. "Man, I can't believe I spent all those years thinking he was in love with you."<br><br> "Idiot." Mel's voice was teasing when she said it, and Angie laughed and said, "Yep."<br><br> They sighed and then glanced around the studio. There was no sign of Blaise. They glanced at each other and Mel shrugged.<br><br> "Blaise, hello," Angie cried out. "It's Angie, your favorite bride."<br><br> Silence greeted them. Mel felt the hair on the back of her neck begin to prickle. No, no, no! She wasn't doing that again. She pictured a unicorn prancing through the studio. It didn't really help.<br><br> "Probably, he's in the bathroom," she said.<br><br> "Yeah," Angie agreed. "I'll just poke my head in the back."<br><br> "Okay," Mel said. Under her breath, she began to chant, "Unicorns and glitter, unicorns and glitter, come on, unicorns and glitter."</p><h2>Broken-Down House: Living Productively in a World Gone Bad</h2><p>Sin has ravaged the house that God created.

Complete with evidence of a conspiracy between the Egyptology establishment and various confidential organizations to keep the secrets of the Pyramids from the world, The Message of the Sphinx is also a modern-day detective story. of photos.</p><p>Graham Hancock was formerly East Africa Correspondent for The Economist and covered the Ogaden war between Somalia and Ethiopia for the London Sunday Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;His books include African Ark:&nbsp;&nbsp;Peoples of the Horn, the widely acclaimed Lords of Poverty, which earned the 1990 H.L.

Why was it built? In this provocative, rigorously argued report, revisionist Egyptologists Hancock (The Fingerprints of the Gods) and Bauval (The Orion Mystery) join forces to answer these questions and more as they examine the Sphinx and its relation to the other monuments of the Giza plateau. Working from the premise that the Giza complex encodes a message, they begin with recently discovered geological evidence indicating that the deep erosion patterns on the flanks of the Sphinx were caused by 1000 years of heavy rain. Such conditions last existed in Egypt at the end of the last ice age, about 10,000-9,000 B.C., meaning that the Sphinx may be more than 12,000 years old (not the generally accepted 4500 years). The authors go on to suggest, using computer simulations of the sky, that the pyramids, representing the three stars of Orion's Belt, along with associated causeways and alignments, constitute a record in stone of the celestial array at the vernal equinox in 10,500 B.C. This moment, they contend, represents Zep Tepi, the "First Time," often referred to in the hieroglyphic record. They show how the initiation rituals of the Egyptian pharaohs replicate on Earth the sun's journey through the stars in this remote era, and they suggest that the "Hall of Records" of a lost civilization may be located by treating the Giza Plateau as a template of these same ancient skies. These daring, well-argued theories will raise the hackles of orthodox Egyptologists?but that doesn't mean they're wrong.

She has written more than one hundred historical novels and novellas, more than thirty of which have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. They include the Bedwyn saga, the Simply quartet, the Huxtable quintet, the seven-part Survivors&#x2019; Club series, and the Westcott series.1<br><p>At the age of twenty-six, Agnes Keeping had never been in love or ever expected to be&#x2014;or even wished to be. She rather chose to be in control of her own emotions and her own life, such as it was.</p><p>At the age of eighteen she had chosen to marry William Keeping, a neighboring gentleman of sober address and steady habits and modest means, after he had very properly called upon her father to make his offer and had then made her a very civil marriage proposal in the presence of her father&#x2019;s second wife. Agnes had been fond of her husband and comfortable with him for almost five years before he died of one of his frequent winter chills. She had mourned him with an empty sort of desolation for longer than the requisite year of wearing her black widow&#x2019;s weeds and still sadly missed him.</p><p>She had not been in love with him, however, or he with her. The very idea seemed absurd, suggestive as it was of a wild, unbridled sort of passion.</p><p>She smiled at her image in the glass as she tried to imagine poor William in an unbridled passion, romantic or otherwise. But then her eyes focused upon herself, and it occurred to her that she had better admire her splendor now while she had the chance, for once she arrived at the ball, it would be instantly apparent that in reality she did not look very magnificent at all.</p><p>She was wearing her green silk evening gown, which she loved despite the fact that it was far from new&#x2014;indeed, she had had it when William was still alive&#x2014;and had not been in the height of fashion even when it was. It was high waisted with a moderately low neckline and short puffy sleeves and was embroidered with silver thread about the hem and the edges of the sleeves. It was not shabby despite its age. One did not, after all, wear one&#x2019;s best evening gown very often, unless one moved in far more elevated social circles than Agnes did. She had been living for several months now in a modest cottage in the village of Inglebrook in Gloucestershire with her elder sister, Dora.</p><p>Agnes had never attended a ball before. She had been to assemblies, of course, and it could be argued that a ball was the same thing by another name. But really there was a world of difference. Assemblies were held in public halls, usually above an inn. Balls were private entertainments hosted by those rich and socially prominent enough to inhabit a house with a ballroom. Such people and such houses did not abound in the English countryside.</p><p>There was one close by, however.</p><p>Middlebury Park, a mere mile from Inglebrook, was a stately mansion belonging to Viscount Darleigh, husband of Agnes&#x2019;s new and dear friend, Sophia. The long wing east of the massive central block housed the state apartments, which were dazzlingly magnificent&#x2014;or so they had appeared to Agnes when Sophia had given her a tour one afternoon not long after they first met. They included a spacious ballroom.</p><p>The viscount had succeeded to his title when his uncle and cousin died a sudden and violent death together, and it was only now, four years later, that Middlebury Park had again become the social center of the neighborhood. Lord Darleigh had been blinded at the age of seventeen when he was an artillery officer in the Peninsular Wars, two years before the title and property and fortune became his. He had lived a retired life at Middlebury until he met and married Sophia in London in the late spring of this year, just before Agnes herself moved to the neighborhood. His marriage and perhaps a growing maturity had instilled in the viscount a confidence he had apparently lacked before, and Sophia herself had set about the task of assisting him and at the same time making a new life for herself as mistress of a large home and estate.</p><p>Hence the ball.</p><p>The two of them were reviving the old tradition of a harvest ball, which had always been held early in October. It was being spoken of in the village, however, as more of a wedding dance and reception than a harvest celebration, for the viscount and his wife had married quietly in London a mere week after they met, and there had been no public celebration of their nuptials. Even their families had not been in attendance. Sophia had promised soon after she arrived at Middlebury that a reception would be held at some time in the foreseeable future, and this ball was it, despite the fact that Sophia was already increasing, a condition that could no longer be quite hidden despite the current fashion for dresses with loosely flowing skirts. Everyone in the neighborhood knew, even though no official announcement had been made.</p><p>It was no exclusive honor to have been invited to the ball, for almost everyone else from the village and the surrounding countryside had been invited too. And Dora had quite a close connection with the viscount and his wife, since she gave both of them pianoforte lessons as well as instruction in the violin and harp to Lord Darleigh. Agnes had been Sophia&#x2019;s friend ever since they had discovered a mutual passion for art, Agnes as a watercolorist, Sophia as a very clever caricaturist and illustrator of children&#x2019;s stories.</p><p>There were to be other, more illustrious guests at the ball than just the people from the neighborhood, however. Lord Darleigh&#x2019;s sisters and their husbands were coming, as well as Viscount Ponsonby, one of the viscount&#x2019;s friends. Sophia had explained that the two men were part of a group of seven persons who had spent several years together in Cornwall recovering from various war wounds. Most of them had been military officers. They called themselves the Survivors&#x2019; Club and spent a few weeks of each year in company with one another.</p><p>Sophia had family members coming too: her uncle Sir Terrence Fry, a senior government diplomat, and another uncle and aunt&#x2014;Sir Clarence and Lady March&#x2014;with their daughter.</p><p>It all sounded very imposing and had Agnes looking forward to it with something bordering on excitement. She had never thought of herself as a person who coveted social splendor, just as she did not think of herself as someone who would ever fall in love. But she was eagerly anticipating this ball, perhaps because Sophia herself was, and Agnes had grown very fond of her young friend. She earnestly wanted the ball to be a great success for Sophia&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>She looked critically at her hair, which she had dressed herself. She had managed to coax some height out of her curls and had left a few tendrils to wave along her neck and over her ears. The style could hardly be called elaborate, nonetheless. And there was nothing remarkable about the hair itself, a nondescript midbrown color, though it did have a healthy shine to it. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the face beneath the hair either, she thought, smiling ruefully at her image. She was not ugly, it was true. Perhaps she was not even quite plain. But she was no ravishing beauty. And, good heavens, had she ever wanted to be? This going-to-a-ball business was turning her head and making her giddy.</p><p>She and Dora arrived early, as most of the outside guests did. Being late was fashionable with the ton during the Season in London, Dora had commented when they set out ten minutes earlier than the early start they had planned. Or so she had heard. But in the country people tended to have better manners. So they were early.</p><p>Agnes was feeling rather breathless by the time they reached the doors of the ballroom. The state apartments looked somehow different and far more magnificent with banks of flowers and hanging baskets everywhere and candles blazing from every wall sconce.</p><p>Sophia was standing just inside the double doors, receiving her guests with Lord Darleigh beside her, and Agnes instantly relaxed and smiled with genuine warmth. Although she did not expect to fall in love herself, she could not deny that such a state existed and that it could be beautiful to behold when it did. Lord and Lady Darleigh positively glowed with a romantic affection for each other, though they never openly demonstrated their feelings in public.</p><p>Sophia looked gorgeous in a turquoise gown that perfectly complemented her auburn hair. That hair had been boyishly short when she was first married. She had been growing it ever since. It was still not long, but her maid had done something clever with it to make it look sleek and elegant, and for the first time it struck Agnes that her friend was more than just pretty in an elfin kind of way. She beamed at Dora and Agnes and hugged them both, and Lord Darleigh, blind though he was, seemed to look directly at them with his very blue eyes as he smiled and shook them by the hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Keeping, Miss Debbins,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;how very kind of you to come to make our evening perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>As though his guests were the ones doing him a favor. He was looking elegant and handsome in black and white.</p><p>It was not difficult to pick out the strangers in the ballroom. One result of living in the country, even when one had been here for only a few months, was that one tended to see the same people wherever one went. And the strangers had brought high fashion with them and quite cast Agnes&#x2019;s best green gown into the shade, as she had fully expected. They outshone everyone else too, except one another.</p><p>Mrs. Hunt, the viscount&#x2019;s mother, kindly undertook to take Dora and Agnes about to introduce them, first to Sir Clarence and Lady March and Miss March, all of whom were looking very distinguished indeed, even if the height of Lady March&#x2019;s hair plumes was rather startling. They nodded with stiff condescension&#x2014;the plumes too&#x2014;and Agnes followed Dora&#x2019;s lead and curtsied. Then there were Sir Terrence Fry and Mr. Sebastian Maycock, his stepson, both of whom were smartly but not ostentatiously clad. The former bowed politely to them and remarked upon the prettiness of the village. The latter, a tall, handsome, personable-looking young gentleman, flashed his teeth at them and pronounced himself to be delighted. He hoped to engage them in some dancing later in the evening, though he did not make any definite appointment with either of them.</p><p>A charmer, Agnes decided, but more enamored of his own charms than other people&#x2019;s. And she really ought not to indulge in such unkind snap judgments when she had almost nothing upon which to base them.</p><p>And then Mrs. Hunt presented them to Viscount Ponsonby, whose immaculately formal evening clothes, all black except for the pristine white of his linen and intricately tied neck cloth and the silver of his waistcoat, set every other man present into the shade except perhaps Viscount Darleigh himself. He was tall and well formed, a blond god of a man, though his hair was not the white blond or the yellow blond that never looked quite right on a man, in Agnes&#x2019;s opinion. His features were classically perfect, his eyes decidedly green. There was a certain world-weariness to those eyes, and the suggestion of mockery in the set of his lips. One long-fingered hand held a silver-handled quizzing glass.</p><p>Agnes felt annoyingly aware of her own ordinariness. And though he did not raise his glass to his eye when Mrs. Hunt introduced them&#x2014;he was, she sensed, far too well mannered to do any such thing&#x2014;she felt nevertheless that she had been thoroughly inspected and dismissed, despite the fact that he bowed to both Dora and herself and asked them how they did and even paid attention to their less than scintillating answers.</p><p>He was the sort of man who always made Agnes uncomfortable, though she had not met many such, it was true. For such stunningly handsome and attractive men made her feel dull and plodding as well as very ordinary, and she always ended up despising herself. How did she want to appear to such men? As an empty-headed eyelid-flutterer? Or as sophisticated and witty, perhaps? What utter nonsense.</p><p>She could not get away from him quickly enough in order to feel like herself again as she spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Latchley and commiserated with the former, who had fallen off the roof of his barn only the week before and broken his leg. He could not sufficiently praise Lord and Lady Darleigh, who had paid him a personal visit and insisted upon sending their own carriage to bring him and his wife to the ball and had even coaxed them into staying the night before being conveyed back home on the morrow.</p><p>Agnes looked around with great enjoyment as they talked. The wooden floor had been polished to a high gloss. There were large pots of autumn-hued flowers everywhere. Three large chandeliers, all the candles alight, hung from a ceiling painted with scenes from mythology. They glinted off the gilded frieze above the wood paneling of the walls and reflected in the many long mirrors, which made the already spacious room look many times larger and many times fuller of flowers and guests. The members of the orchestra&#x2014;yes, there was actually an eight-piece orchestra come all the way from Gloucester&#x2014;had taken their places on the dais at one end of the room and were tuning their instruments.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, had arrived. Lord Darleigh and Sophia had turned into the room, and Sir Terrence Fry was making his way toward them with the obvious intention of leading his niece out for the first set of country dances. Agnes smiled. It was also amusing to watch the Marches maneuver themselves closer to Viscount Ponsonby. It was very clear that they intended him to partner Miss March for the first set. It was doubly amusing to watch him stroll unhurriedly away from them without even glancing in their direction. He was clearly a gentleman accustomed to avoiding unwelcome advances. Oh, she must share this with Sophia when she next saw her after tonight. Sophia was wickedly good at sketching caricatures.</p><p>Agnes was so busy observing the look of chagrin on the faces of all three Marches that she did not notice at first that Viscount Ponsonby was moving in the direction of the sofa along which Mr. Latchley&#x2019;s splinted leg was stretched. Except that he was not coming to commiserate or even to nod a greeting to the injured man. Instead he stopped and bowed to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Keeping,&#x201d; he said, his voice languid, even a trifle bored, &#x201c;one is expected to d-dance, I believe, at such gatherings. At least, that is what my friend Darleigh informed me this afternoon. And although he is quite b-blind and one might assume he would not see if I did not dance, I know him well enough to feel quite c-certain that he would see even if no one told him. What is the point of having a blind friend, I sometimes ask myself, if one cannot deceive him in such matters?&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, he stuttered slightly&#x2014;surely his only outward imperfection. His eyelids partly drooped over his eyes as he spoke to give him his slightly sleepy look, though the eyes themselves did not look sleepy at all.</p><p>Agnes laughed. She did not know what else to do. Was he asking her to dance? But he had not said so, had he?</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said, raising his quizzing glass almost but not quite to his eye. He had beautifully manicured nails, she saw, on a hand that was nevertheless quite unmistakably male. &#x201c;Quite so. You s-sympathize with me, I see. But one must dance. Will you do me the honor, ma&#x2019;am, of hoofing it about the floor with me?&#x201d;</p><p>He was asking her to dance, and the opening set at that. She had been hoping quite fervently that someo...</p></p><h2>The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets</h2><p><p><b>In this much-anticipated book, a leading economist argues that many key problems of the American economy are due not to the flaws of capitalism or the inevitabilities of globalization but to the concentration of corporate power. By lobbying against competition, the biggest firms drive profits higher while depressing wages and limiting opportunities for investment, innovation, and growth.</b></p><p>Why are cell-phone plans so much more expensive in the United States than in Europe? It seems a simple question. But the search for an answer took Thomas Philippon on an unexpected journey through some of the most complex and hotly debated issues in modern economics. Ultimately he reached his surprising conclusion: American markets, once a model for the world, are giving up on healthy competition. Sector after economic sector is more concentrated than it was twenty years ago, dominated by fewer and bigger players who lobby politicians aggressively to protect and expand their profit margins. Across the country, this drives up prices while driving down investment, productivity, growth, and wages, resulting in more inequality. Meanwhile, Europe&#x2015;long dismissed for competitive sclerosis and weak antitrust&#x2015;is beating America at its own game.</p><p>Philippon, one of the world&#x2019;s leading economists, did not expect these conclusions in the age of Silicon Valley start-ups and millennial millionaires. But the data from his cutting-edge research proved undeniable. In this compelling tale of economic detective work, we follow him as he works out the basic facts and consequences of industry concentration in the U.S. and Europe, shows how lobbying and campaign contributions have defanged antitrust regulators, and considers what all this means for free trade, technology, and innovation. For the sake of ordinary Americans, he concludes, government needs to return to what it once did best: keeping the playing field level for competition. It&#x2019;s time to make American markets great&#x2015;and free&#x2015;again.</p></p><p>Thomas Philippon is the Max L. Heine Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business, New York University. He was named one of the top 25 economists under 45 by the IMF and won the Bern�cer Prize for Best European Economist. He currently serves as an academic advisor to the Financial Stability Board and to the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research.

America is no longer the home of the free-market economy...The great obstacle to action in the U.S. is the pervasive role of money in politics. The results are the twin evils of oligopoly and oligarchy...Donald Trump is in so many ways a product of the defective capitalism described in <i>The Great Reversal</i>. What the U.S. needs, instead, is another Teddy Roosevelt and his energetic trust-busting. Is that still imaginable?

We don&#x2019;t know if Philippon is a fan of Donald Trump, but his analysis points to one way of making America great again: restoring our free-market competitiveness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arthur Herman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling read for those interested in the dynamics of the overall innovation economy or the political debate over antitrust and Big Tech...A timely analysis of the weakening of America&#x2019;s regulatory regime for protecting free market competition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Peckham</b><b>, </b><b><i>TechCrunch</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Everyone in tech or interested in tech ought to read this book&#x2015;it provides a rigorous, but easy-to-grasp look at the economics of consolidation and what it does to markets, prices, and products.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nilay Patel</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Verge</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Should we love American capitalism, or hate it?

A clarifying guide to the political reforms we need to make the market work for ordinary people.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Yascha Mounk, author of <i>The People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Superbly exposited and replete with examples, this marvelous book illustrates the challenges the United States faces today in reversing its decades-long slide into monopoly and economic oligarchy. A master class in political economy, it draws on the author&#x2019;s own pathbreaking academic research, yet shows great respect for competing points of view. Philippon&#x2019;s quantitative contrast between highly monopolized U.S. markets and highly competitive European markets is particularly striking. The data suggests that Americans should not be so complacent about their apparent economic superiority.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University</b></p><h2>In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court</h2><p><p>Hailed by ESPN as the world&#x2019;s most famous female basketball player, Brittney Griner, the dunking phenom and national sensation who is shattering stereotypes and breaking boundaries, now shares her coming-of-age story, revealing how she found her strength to overcome bullies and to embrace her authentic self.</p><p>Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA Draft, is a once-in-a-generation player, possessing a combination of size and athleticism never before seen in the women&#x2019;s game.

In <i>Typographic Systems</i>, Kim Elam, author of our bestselling books, <i>Geometry of Design</i> and <i>Grid Systems</i>, explores eight major structural frameworks beyond the gridincluding random, radial, modular, and bilateralsystems. By taking the reader through exercises, student work, and professional examples, Elam offers a broad range of design solutions. <p>Once essential visual organization systems are understood the designer can fluidly organize words or images within a structure, combination of structures, or a variation of a structure. With clarity and substance, each systemfrom the structured axis to the nonhierarchical radial arrayis explained and explored so that the reader comes away with a better understanding of these intricate complex arrangements. <i>Typographic Systems</i> is the seventh title in our bestselling Design Briefs series, which has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide.</p></p><p>Kimberly Elam is chairperson of the Graphic and Interactive Communication Department at the Ringling School of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida. Her books Geometry of Design and Grid Systems have become standard reference works for students and practicing designers.A beautiful little book on the rules for organizing type in graphic design. While the grid system is undoubtedly the author's favorite, Elam expertly reveals the potential that the other systems (rarely seen in print or on-screen work these days) can have in enabling visual solutions for the graphic designer. -- <i>Creative Review, June 2007</i><br><br>"To be a good designer, you must be creative. But because all design is based on structural systems, it's also important to factor systemic thinking into your work. . . . Elam describes a structural system that can be broken down into eight main categories. Each chapter of Typographic Systems tackles one of these topics, providing an in-depth explanation of the system as well as visual examplescomplete with transparent diagrams you can place over imagesto aid comprehension." --STEP Inside Design, May, 2007</p><h2>The Big Book of Preserving the Harvest: 150 Recipes for Freezing, Canning, Drying and Pickling Fruits and Vegetables</h2><p>Learn how to preserve a summer day &#x2014; in batches &#x2014; from this classic primer on drying, freezing, canning, and pickling techniques.

For more information, visit WildFeminine.com.Mothering from Your Center ONE<p></p> Becoming a Mother<p></p> <br><br> <br>Mothering is a hands-on creative process that can be tended and shaped like any creation. Spirit is calling you to mother something born of your own essence and experience. This masterwork of your mothering, your motherpiece, is essential. As you grow into your motherhood, your way of being will change. These evolutions inspire the palate for creations and additions to your motherpiece. Mothering becomes an inspired process for giving expression to your creative essence.<br> <br>In my women&#x2019;s health practice, I have learned to read the energy patterns of the pelvic bowl, including organ energies and energy flow that change with a woman&#x2019;s creative cycle. Pregnancy has a distinct sense of energetic fullness. The energy gathers to sustain a new life. Three times I have felt the fullness of pregnancy energy in the pelvis of women who have come to see me, only to find that they were not yet pregnant. In each case, the woman had a menstrual period and then became pregnant on her next ovulation cycle. Two of the women were actively trying to conceive, and in one case it was a happy surprise.<br> <br>I am intrigued by this sense of energetic fullness in a woman&#x2019;s pelvis, the way the energy of pregnancy is palpable before an actual pregnancy. A colleague who is an acupuncturist relayed a concept from one of her Oriental medicine teachers: the energy of conception is thought to occur three months prior to a physical conception. For a Western mind, this challenges our understanding of conception as only a physical process. But the more I learn about the relationship between the energy flow and subsequent response in the physical field, the more this idea of conception energy makes sense.<br> <br>I ponder my personal experience with conception. With each of our sons, there was a conscious yes, a point where my husband and I made a decision or accepted the potential of pregnancy about three months prior to the physical manifestation. But what about accidental pregnancies? Or women who do everything they can to conceive but to no avail? Conception and the embodiment of a new soul is one of life&#x2019;s great mysteries. Energetically, for any creation we make, we hold the essence in the center of our body. When I am writing a book, I feel pregnant with the creative energy that will infuse my creation. Working with the energy in the center, a woman can consciously cultivate what she creates in every aspect of her life.<br> <br>When, then, does one become a mother? Is it marked by conception, pregnancy, birth, or adopting a child? Rather than a certain beginning point, I think of motherhood as a process of becoming&#x2014;much like life is made by living. After a decade of mothering, I know significantly more than when I began. I thank my oldest son for being &#x201c;my first pancake&#x201d; and coming into a new set of parents. Besides tending a child and working with your creative essence, becoming a mother also requires addressing your mothering lineage. Most of the women I see in my practice have &#x201c;mother issues,&#x201d; meaning that they struggle with various aspects of how they were mothered or the relationship with their mother. Though there can be &#x201c;father issues&#x201d; for women as well, becoming a mother means stepping into the lineage of motherhood: renegotiating the lines that define it and making your own mothering imprint.<br> Mothering as a Spiritual Path<p></p> <br>Mothering is a true spiritual path in that it will expand your spirit, make painfully visible your personal limitations, and bring some of the greatest heart-opening moments of bliss&#x2014;sometimes all in one day. When you bring forth something new from the center of your being&#x2014;giving life to a child or a creative manifestation such as a work of art&#x2014;there is an intensity in this process, like the heat of a kiln as it fires clay. This creative intensity is generated by the immense task of nurturing a new soul while simultaneously becoming aware of one&#x2019;s inadequacies to do so.<br> <br>I stepped into motherhood after a full-tilt decade of driving ambition that took me through my professional education and into my career as a physical therapist. This all came to a screeching halt with the infant pace of my first son. Instead of the high velocity I had become accustomed to, each day in the first year of tending my son stretched out in long swaths of time, with little structure and the infinite nonlinear caregiving tasks. Like many mothers who find themselves in this position, I was both amazed by my son&#x2019;s beauty and confounded by my lack of preparation for this shift in how I lived. My body pulsed with the current of the external world and the rapid pace of its culture; yet now my focus was my home and my baby, who began quite literally with tiny movements that barely reached outside his parents&#x2019; arms or the bed where we lay.<br> <br>To mother my first son, and eventually three, from a more whole place, I went to the deeper currents of the spirit realm. I learned how to care for my wild feminine energy, to supply the stores needed for bringing my children forth and tending them as well as my women&#x2019;s health practice and writing. My guidance for mothering and creative direction came from being present in my own center. In my work and my life, I have found that if a woman attunes to her center, her body contains vast information for cultivating all she tends. By developing my family life and work practice from the organic flow of spirit energy that moves from within, I hope to teach my children to attune to their own creative centers as well. I want my sons to witness that by opening ourselves to the possibility in each moment, we are most likely to encounter the sacred in the midst of living an awakened life. By meeting spirit in this way, we tend to its presence in our lives naturally, finding a deep satisfaction as we do so.<br> The Mother Place<p></p> <br>The uterus is our direct connection to the Great Mother, drawing in the raw potential to manifest and tend our creations. In Wild Feminine, I shared my experiences of working with the pelvic bowl and the surprising realization that women are typically lacking presence in their creative core. Modern women are generally unaware of how to access their own powerful root source of creative and feminine energies, and this contributes to a general ambivalence about mothering. Yet mothering calls us directly back to the home and the center of ourselves. Learning to access these root energies for our mothering enables us to harness this core creative essence for making a soulful life with our children.<br> <br>The womb is a sacred place, whether we carry children there or cultivate our best creative work. Forming a relationship with the womb and realigning with this place of mothering are essential to activating the creative potential in all that we do. Ponder your own relationship with your womb and mothering essence with the following exercise.<br> <br>Exercise: Creative Essence Meditation<br> <br>1.&nbsp;Imagine your creative essence, your mothering capacity. What does it look like? How does it feel? Where do you access it within your body?<br> <br>2.&nbsp;Reflect upon how you are presently using your female energy to create or sustain something in your daily life. What inner rhythms or guidance are you following? Are you nourishing yourself as a part of your mothering? Is this how you desire to use your creative essence?<br> <br>3.&nbsp;Ponder your creative desires. What do you love? How does your creative essence seek expression? How can this connect to your mothering?<br> <br>4.&nbsp;Imagine a sacred place in the wild, or find a place to sit where you are directly in contact with the earth. Let your center respond to this vision or earth connection. What makes your creative energy come alive? How does your body feel when you access this potential?<br> <br>5.&nbsp;Remind yourself to connect regularly with your own creative wellspring. Garden, sing, or take an art or movement class. You can even shape your whole day from this inner creative current. Let your mothering come from within and take note of the beauty that arises.<br> Practicing Presence and Tending to Spirit<p></p> <br>Within each day and every creative cycle, there is an energy current we can pay attention to and even synchronize with. In doing so, we discover our ability to tend spirit while also attending to the details of living. Trying to make sense of my days with my children, I reached beyond the idea of a schedule based solely on time. Instead of a rigid structure, our schedule was made from the flow of each day. Any agenda or item on the to-do list could easily shift when a child became tired or ill or required extra comfort. Our rhythm also shifted from season to season or as we had more children and our family needs changed. Together we moved through creative cycles large and small that evolved as they transitioned from babies to toddlers and to increasingly independent&#x2014;but still profoundly connected&#x2014;school-age children and beyond.<br> <br>Practicing presence, by noticing the movement that infuses a moment or a particular aspect of life, we receive a direct connection with the divine. Moving away from outer distractions and instead dropping into pure presence as mothers, we can access the greater energies that are always there to inspire and sustain us. We begin to witness our blessings as part of our daily routine, nourishing the soul just as naturally as we eat or breathe.<br> <br>What new rhythms have come in the process of mothering?<br> <br>How has your way of being been reinspired?<br> Embracing the Shadow<p></p> <br>Accepting the path of motherhood will not simply bring you to your place of joy or connection with spirit; rather, it often will reveal where you have blocks. Like all spiritual journeys, the challenges you encounter will show the psychic debris that has accumulated in your energetic field.<br> <br>With its rigorous and prolonged period of demands, mothering taxes the body, mind, and soul in a manner similar to a grueling meditation regimen. On a spiritual retreat, participants often awaken in the early hours of the morning to meditate, placing the body in a zone of discomfort designed to clarify the spirit. Mothering does the same. The children you tend will assist you in meeting your shadow and finding the obstacles that limit your spiritual growth.<br> <br>In this process of transformation, the intensity of mothering reveals a woman&#x2019;s roughest edges. I thought of myself as a composed and compassionate person until I became a mother. Then I realized that my thoughtful demeanor actually arose from my ability to control many aspects of my life. Similar to the spiritual seekers who live a comfortable life but then are surprised by the difficult feelings they encounter on a spiritual retreat, I came face to face with my own internal hungers. By entering the often nonlinear path of mothering, where my time was organized by the home-based needs of my infant, I had no choice but to face the stored energies and dormant needs of my spirit, which I had previously managed to ignore.<br> <br>In mothering from the center, we can also encounter a more authentic self. Living and growing with children, who live entirely in the present moment, fosters authenticity. Tending children, your world slows just enough to invite a return to the core, which allows for more authentic ways of being. Be willing to meet the places where your spirit has gone hungry, and tend yourself as well. Mothering from this central place&#x2014;from where your children arise&#x2014;takes you to the heart of what matters and reconnects you with the essence of life.<br> <br>What mystery does mothering invite you toward?<br> <br>How are you challenged and blessed by the spiritual journey of mothering?<br> <br>How can you embrace a particular challenge to receive the blessing?<br> Traversing the Wild Feminine Landscape<p></p> <br>The wild feminine landscape is the term I use to refer to the energetic and physical creative range within the female body. In referencing this creative center, I intentionally chose words that evoke the resonance between the female body and the earth as the place where we can cultivate our own creative potential.<br> <br>I have come to know this place in my work with the female body as a women&#x2019;s health physical therapist. My profession embodies the best preventative medicine for women&#x2019;s health, yet this medicine is hardly known. Women&#x2019;s health physical therapy has some amazing physical medicine tools to address and resolve pelvic problems like pain or prolapse (when the uterus or bladder fall toward the vaginal opening) as well as to augment postpartum healing, but the model for women&#x2019;s healthcare is not yet preventative or holistic in its general approach.<br> <br>One of the essential women&#x2019;s health physical therapy tools is an internal vaginal massage, which rebalances pelvic muscles and fascia. Fascia is a sheath layer that wraps around the organs and muscles, providing an internal elastic support system. Birthing or even a hard fall to the pelvis can set up tension patterns or adhesions in the fascial layer, disrupting pelvic health. Aligning the fascia through vaginal massage (also termed internal myofascial release), restores the full engagement of the pelvic muscles, proper alignment of the pelvic organs, sexual vibrance, and the energy flow of the core.<br> <br>By enhancing the core flow, vaginal massage brings greater vivacity to the female body and ought to be a basic part of women&#x2019;s healthcare. The health in the pelvic bowl affects many aspects, from how a woman&#x2019;s body supports her to how much pleasure she can access. In fact, while I have used vaginal massage to alleviate a myriad of pelvic symptoms, women have also reported increased vitality, improved libido, and a more dynamic feeling within. This core energy flow also determines a woman&#x2019;s creative capacity.<br> <br>After working in the pelvic bowl with thousands of women, I see these core physical and energetic patterns as a filter through which we perceive and manifest our creative lives. We inherit many of these patterns from our lineage and life experience, but they can interact with and be shaped by ways that support more creative abundance and flow. By exploring the physical, energetic, and spiritual aspects of our female form, we discover the lines that define our creative range. We also find places to restore or expand this range so that it better serves our creative lives as women and mothers (rather than living with only what we were given).<br> <br>The physical body, including the pelvic bowl, contains your physical patterns and embodied forms that define your creative capacity and fertility. Around the physical core is the energy of the pelvic organs. In this physical and energetic meeting place, there are creative patterns and ways of using energy that influence all you create as a woman. Physical alignment in the pelvic bowl supports energy flow; energetic alignment enhances physical vitality. The more you understand how to work with this vibrance of your pelvic bowl, the more you gain your full range of creative potential.<br> <br>Delving into the mystical, we must remember our female bodies as a doorway to the divine, where life enters. In the creation of a child, a spirit enters from the spiritual realm. Energy gathers in the womb, and a physical body is made.

Using their entire savings as a down payment, the couple embark on an adventure that brings them in contact with the charming countryside of Provence, its querulous personalities, petty bureaucracies, and extraordinary wildlife. From the glamour of Cannes and the Isles of L&amp;eacuterins to the charm of her own small plot of land-which she transforms from overgrown weeds into a thriving farm-Drinkwater triumphantly relates how she realized her dream of a peaceful, meaningful life.</p><p><b>Carol Drinkwater</b> is a multi-award-winning actress who is best known for her portrayal of Helen Herriot in the BBC television series <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>, and is the author of more than 20 books, both fiction and nonfiction. Her quartet of memoirs set on her olive farm in the south of France have sold more than a million copies worldwide, and her solo journey through the Mediterranean in search of the olive tree's mythical secrets inspired a five-part documentary film series. Carol lives in the south of France, where she is writing her next novel.Following in the footsteps of bestselling authors Peter Mayle (A Year in Provence) and Frances Mayes (Under the Tuscan Sun), Drinkwater has written a memoir of her flight to the good life in southern France. "All my life-long, I dreamed of acquiring a shabby-chic house and renovating it," writes the author, a British actress who starred in the BBC adaptation of James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small. When she and her husband, Michel, spot a hillside villa with an olive vineyard in a village near Cannes, they defy common sense and become landowners. Never mind that it is moldering and insect-infested, the roof leaks and there doesn't seem to be any running water. Drinkwater's account of paradise regained involves bushwhacking through the intricacies of French property law and battling the elements of nature (wind, rain and fire), to say nothing of the eccentric local population. Alas, the book reads, by turns, like a catalogue of the author's real-estate woes ("We have a leaking roof!") and a ponderous love poem ("We are two embarking on this path together. Newly in love. Thrilled by one another... Investing in love, in one another."). Still, for all its false notes, the book describes life in the South of France with lush, voluptuous appreciation and successfully plays into our fantasies of the Mediterranean "land of liquor and honey." Agent, Ed Victor Ltd. (June 15)Forecast: Many readers will find this idealized portrait of a culture and a way of life most appealing. Drinkwater's book seems poised to attract fans of Mayle, Mayes and others of the expatriates-in-paradise genre.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The 20th Century Children&#39;s Poetry Treasury</h2><p>"Until this century, most children's poetry was either syrupy sweet or overblown and didactic, and tended to talk down to its readers.

From the Beat poetry of the '50s to the spoken word of the 1990s, <i>The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</i> brings readers the words, visions, and extravagant lives of bohemians, beatniks, hippies, punks, and slackers.

Here are the expected Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Kenneth Patchen, Diane DiPrima, Michael McClure, Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), Ai, and Lawrence Ferlinghettiall long accepted into the American poetry idiom. Along with them are more recent poets like Luis J. Rodriguez, Jimmy Santiago Baca, and Joy Harjo, who have earned significant standing for themselves even inside academia, as well as performance poets Marc Smith and Lisa Martinovic, who've garnered reputations only outside it. Anthologized along with these poets are activists Che Guevara and Abbie Hoffman; painter Jackson Pollock; and singer-songwriters Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison. Notorious novelists Henry Miller and Norman Mailer make appearances, as do stand-up comedians Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor. But the unknowns outnumber the knowns, and the knowns do not necessarily contribute their best work (Harjo's ``Two Horses'' is a significant exception). Many prose pieces abound, as well as what only looks like poetry, and too much of what is collected here is a series of rants. The anthology is loosely organizedinto sections like Slammers, Barbarians, Meat Poets, and American Renegadesbut without any apparent aesthetic beyond Kaufman's claim that these Outlaw poets share ``an unspoken objective: to get in your face and stay there.'' The value of such a ``bible'' is questionable. And without better organization or at least an index, the collection remains an unwieldy hodgepodge. Navigating through the bulk of nearly a thousand pages is a chore simply not worth the effort. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Greek warships faced an invading Persian armada in the narrow Salamis Straits in the most important naval battle of the ancient world. Overwhelmingly outnumbered by the enemy, the Greeks triumphed through a combination of strategy and deception. More than two millennia after it occurred, the clash between the Greeks and Persians at Salamis remains one of the most tactically brilliant battles ever fought. The Greek victory changed the course of western history - halting the advance of the Persian Empire and setting the stage for the Golden Age of Athens. In this dramatic new narrative account, historian and classicist Barry Strauss brings this landmark battle to life. He introduces us to the unforgettable characters whose decisions altered history: Themistocles, Athens&#39; great leader (and admiral of its fleet), who devised the ingenious strategy that effectively destroyed the Persian navy in one day; Xerxes, the Persian king who fought bravely but who ultimately did not understand the sea; Aeschylus, the playwright who served in the battle and later wrote about it; and Artemisia, the only woman commander known from antiquity, who turned defeat into personal triumph. Filled with the sights, sounds, and scent of battle, The Battle of Salamis is a stirring work of history.</p><p>Barry Strauss, professor of history and classics at Cornell University, is a leading expert on ancient military history. He has written or edited several books, including <i>The Battle of Salamis</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Trojan War</i>, <i>The Spartacus War</i>, <i>Masters of Command</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Death of Caesar</i>, and <i>Ten Caesars</i>. Visit BarryStrauss.com.In 1851, Edward Creasey published his famous book on 15 "decisive" battles, battles that had determined the course of history. The most recent was Waterloo (1815 A.D.) and the earliest Salamis (480 B.C.), a naval battle between a small alliance of Greek city-states and an empire that ruled the territory from the Indus river to the Greek islands of the Aegean. It was indeed a decisive battle; a Persian victory would have strangled Athenian democracy before it could produce the work of the tragic poets, historians and philosophers that shaped and inspired the European Renaissance. But Salamis was no easy victory, and this account of it by a history professor who is an expert on naval warfare with a gift for vivid narrative brings it, in all its suspense, its complications, its surprises and its cast of extraordinary characters, to fervent and turbulent life.<p>In 490 B.C., the Persian Great King Darius, as retaliation for Athenian support of Greek cities that had rebelled against Persian rule, sent an expeditionary force that landed at Marathon, only to be defeated and driven back to its ships by Athenian infantry. Darius vowed revenge, but it was his successor, Xerxes, who in 480 B.C. moved against Greece in overwhelming military and naval force, not just to punish Athens but to add the whole of Greece to the Persian empire. In the intervening years, however, Athens, on the initiative of Themistocles, had transformed itself into a major naval power, with a fleet of 200 triremes.</p><p>A trireme was a war galley propelled by 170 oarsmen seated at three different levels. It is only in recent years that scholars and naval experts have figured out how the oars were arranged, and the Greek navy now has a flagship trireme for use on ceremonial occasions. The oarsmen were Athenian citizens, not, as in some galleys that sailed the Mediterranean in later centuries, slaves or convicts; the ship also carried archers and marines for boarding. But the main offensive technique was the use of the metal-sheathed ram that projected from the prow at water level; it was driven into the stern of the enemy vessel and then withdrawn. Another offensive technique was to come alongside the enemy from the rear, ship oars and crash through the oars on the enemy ship, leaving it helpless, to be dealt with later. The combined fleets of the Greek coalition -- Athens, Aegina and Corinth prominent among them -- amounted to 333 ships at its peak; the Persian fleet sailed for Greek waters with 1,227, but a three-day storm off Mount Pelion reduced the number to 927.</p><p>Strauss gives a clear and fascinating account, made easy to follow by his sketch-maps, of the maneuvers that led up to the battle: the Greek fleet at Artemisium successfully testing the mettle of the Persians; the breakthrough of the Persians at Thermopylae, where a force of 300 Spartans had held it up for three days in the narrows between mountains and the sea; the swift transfer of the Greek fleet to Salamis, where the Athenians evacuated their women, children and old men from Athens and the Persian army destroyed the city; the arrival of the Persian fleet at Phaleron on the Attic coast opposite Salamis; and the preliminaries of the battle, including the erection of a throne on Mount Aegaleos from which Xerxes could watch the climactic battle of the two fleets.</p><p>It looked at first as if the decisive battle of Salamis might not take place. Strauss gives a trenchant picture of the situation among the Greek ships: "a navy whose main admirals cordially hated each other. A naval commander in chief who came from a city [Sparta] famous for its inattention to ships. A naval base teeming with refugees whom it could not feed for long. A set of allies who were itching to leave the war zone." The Corinthians, whose ships were the largest contingent after Athens's, were planning to leave for the Isthmus of Corinth to protect their own city. The situation seemed desperate, and Themistocles resorted to what he was famous for: deceit. He sent a trusted emissary, who spoke Persian, secretly by night in a small boat to the Persian fleet with a message for Xerxes: He despaired of the Greek situation and wished to come over to the Persian side and offered this information, that in the morning the Greek fleet would disperse, leaving the Bay of Salamis. Xerxes fell for the trap and ordered his weary fleet, tired from a long day of battle, to prepare for an attack on the Greeks. There was much to be done, as Strauss puts it: "There are always repairs to be made to wooden boats, especially boats as fragile as the trireme. Oars break, ropes snap, sails tear, leather oar holes break, seats split. . . ." It was with tired and dispirited crews that the Persian ships moved out to block the Greeks' "escape" only to find themselves the target of a fierce Greek attack.</p><p>The battle raged all day, watched by Xerxes from his throne, and by evening it was clear that the Persian fleet had been defeated.

Set to have a vacation away from her home life and the tax man, Julia takes a trip with her art-loving boyfriend. However, all is not what it seems. Could he in fact be an employee of the establishment she has been trying to escape from? And how did her romantic luxurious holiday end in murder?</p><p><b>Sarah Caudwell</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Thus Was Adonis Murdered, The Shortest Way to Hades,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Sirens Sang of Murder</i>, and <i>The Sibyl in Her Grave</i>. She studied law at St. Anne's College, Oxford; was called to the Chancery Bar; and practiced as a barrister for several years in Lincoln's Inn. She then became a member of the legal department of a major London bank, where she found herself specializing in international tax planning. She died in 2000.Caudwell's far-fetched story is given credibility by Haddon's realistic narration. When scatter-brained Julia Larwood decides to leave her tax worries behind and take a luxury trip to Venice, tragedy befalls her. Through her letters, friends back in England try to unravel her problems. Julia and her friends live lives of high drama in which everything is thoroughly dissected. Subtly ironic humor is slipped in when things get too serious. Haddon splendidly meets each challenge as she effortlessly glides from presenting action via letters, speaking in international accents, and illuminating the story's stereotypical characters. This title isn't for everyone, but those who appreciate a complex plot will revel in the odd romance.

With visceral stories and humor from Salatin's half-century as a "lunatic" farmer, Salatin contrasts the differences on many levels: practical, spiritual, social, economic, ecological, political, and nutritional.</p> <p>In today's conventional food-production paradigm, any farm that is open-sourced, compost-fertilized, pasture-based, portably-infrastructured, solar-driven, multi-speciated, heavily peopled, and soil-building must be operated by a lunatic. Modern, normal, reasonable farmers erect "No Trespassing" signs, deplete soil, worship annuals, apply petroleum-based chemicals, produce only one commodity, erect Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, and discourage young people from farming.</p> <p>Anyone looking for ammunition to defend a more localized, solar-driven, diversified food system will find an entire arsenal in these pages. With wit and humor honed during countless hours working on the farm he loves, and then interacting with conventional naysayers, Salatin brings the land to life, farming to sacredness, and food to ministry.</p> <p>Divided into four main sections, the first deals with principles to nurture the earth, an idea mainline farming has never really endorsed. The second section describes food and fiber production, including the notion that most farmers don't care about nutrient density or taste because all they want is shipability and volume. The third section, titled "Respect for Life," presents an apologetic for food sacredness and farming as a healing ministry. Only lunatics would want less machinery and pathogenicity. Oh, the ecstasy of not using drugs or paying bankers. How sad. The final section deals with promoting community, including the notion that more farmers would be a good thing.<br> <br> </p></p><p><p>Joel Salatin and his family own and operate Polyface Farm in Virginia&#x2019;s Shenandoah Valley.

But sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to know just how to give <i>back</i> to God. How much is enough? What does the Bible really say? What should giving look like in our everyday lives? Filled with good news for followers of Jesus, Mark Allan Powell&#x2019;s <i>Giving to God</i> shows Christians the way to a better life and a better relationship with their money &#x2014; and with God. Powell presents stewardship as an act of worship, an expression of faith, and a discipline for spiritual growth. Faithful use of our time, talents, and money starts with a deep, satisfying relationship with the God to whom we belong. We can then learn, says Powell, to give gladly and generously out of our heartfelt connection with God. Informative, concise, and eminently practical (including discussion questions), <i>Giving to God</i> gives us resources for best using the treasures, material and otherwise, that God has given us.</p><p>Mark Allan Powell is a Bible scholar and theologian widely recognized for his work in spiritual formation and congregational ministries. The Robert and Phyllis Leatherman Professor of New Testament Studies at Trinity Lutheran Seminary, Columbus, Ohio, he<b><i>Trinity Seminary Review</i></b><br> "[<i>Giving to God</i>] is a fresh, holistic, well-rooted treatise on giving. . . A valuable, thought-provoking gift to give first-year members or to any people seriously yearning to practice their faith, or wanting their hearts to catch up with their good intentions."<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i></b><br> "Powell has produced a fine specimen of what may be the rarest species in the genus&nbsp;<i>theologica litteratura</i>: an accessible and engaging text from a top-flight scholar, addressing a critical issue in the life of churches and individual believers."<br><br><b><i>Presbyterians Today</i></b><br> "Powell stresses that faithfulness to God in our time, treasures and talents is good news, not just drudgery or obligation. Exploring&nbsp;<i>Giving to God</i>&nbsp;will prove to be good stewardship of a reader's time."<br><br><b><i>Prism</i></b><br> "The author carefully demonstrates that the gospel of stewardship is not tantamount to a divine investment or insurance policy. Citing 2 Corinthians 9:6,11, Powell notes, 'Such rewards need not be tangible . . . those who give of their earthly treasure experience the spiritual reward of hearts increasingly drawn into the wondrous s love of God.' The meat of the text is sound teaching about this very dynamic."<br><br><b>Douglas John Hall</b><br> &#x2014; McGill University<br> "This is a wonderfully readable book on a subject that ought to have priority in the thinking of not only Christians but all human beings on our much-threatened planet. Mark Powell's prose is full of fascinating anecdotes and allusions, making it immediately accessible to the reader.

The New York Times Book Review<br>A Hamish Macbeth mystery. <br>Wealthy Maggie Baird is neither nice nor kind nor generous. Once she was beautiful, but now, although middle-aged, she retains the appetites of a beautiful woman. When Maggie's car catches fire with her inside it, suspicion focuses on the five houseguests staying at Maggie's luxurious Highlands cottage: her timid niece and four former lovers, once of whom Maggie had intended to pick for a husband. All five are impecunious. All five had ample opportunity to monkey with Maggie's car. So finding who did it requires all Police Constable Hamish Macbeth's extraordinary common sense and insight into human nature. And lazy lout though he may be, Hamish lets no grass grow under his feet when it comes to solving a murder. Especially when he may be the next target.</p><p><b>M.C. Beaton</b> lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. She writes the Agatha Raisin mystery series as well as the Hamish Macbeth mystery series.The Scottish village of Lochdubh has a problem: the beloved police constable, Hamish Macbeth ( Death of a Perfect Wife ), has been transferred to Strathbane because of a dearth of local crime. In a successful bid to get him back, the villagers, led by newcomer Maggie Baird, organize a crime wave. On his return, Hamish is confronted with a possible murder. Maggie, who in younger and slimmer years had amassed a fortune as a well-rewarded kept woman, dies, ostensibly of a heart attack during a car fire. Suspects include her niece and heir, Alison, who had been living with Maggie after recuperating from lung cancer, and four of Maggie's former lovers and present suitors, whom she had invited for a visit: an ad man, a car salesman, a manager of a gambling club and a fading pop singer, all of them in dire need of money. Hamish draws on his knowledge of the local people and of human nature to solve the case. Meanwhile he continues his off-again, on-again romance with a daughter of the local gentry and attempts to stay out of hot water with his superiors, who resent his unpredictable approach to life and policing. Beaton's newest continues one of the finest, and most offbeat, police procedural series around. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pandolfini&#39;s Endgame Course: Basic Endgame Concepts Explained by America&#39;s Leading Chess Teacher (Fireside Chess Library)</h2><p>Analyzes a variety of endgames, discusses strategy, and looks at confrontations between unlike pieces</p><p>The endgame has always been a particularly instructive phase of chess play. it provides the perfect opportunity for understanding the potential power of each chess piece in every chess situation-from opening move to checkmate.

Mercer bought a book, and the staff invited him up for tea. Within weeks, he was living above the store, working for the proprietor, George Whitman, patron saint of the city's down-and-out writers, and immersing himself in the love affairs and low-down watering holes of the shop's makeshift staff. <i>Time Was Soft There </i>is the story of a journey down a literary rabbit hole in the shadow of Notre Dame, to a place where a hidden bohemia still thrives.</p><p><b>Jeremy Mercer</b> was formerly a journalist for the <i>Ottawa Citizen.</i> He is the author of two crime books and founder of <i>Kilometer Zero,</i> a cult literary magazine currently being published out of Shakespeare &amp; Co.<b></b>Time Was Soft There<br>1.It was a gray winter Sunday when I came to the bookstore.As had been my habit during that troubled time, I was out walking. There was never a specific destination, merely an accumulation of random turns and city blocks to numb the hours and distract from the problems at hand. It was surprisingly easy to forget oneself among the bustling markets and grand boulevards, the manicured parks and marble monuments.On this particular day, a thin drizzle had begun falling early in the afternoon. At first, it was barely enough to wet the wool of a sweater, let alone interrupt this serious business of walking. But later, toward dusk, the skies abruptly thundered and opened into a downpour. Shelter was needed, and from where I'd been caught near the cathedral of Notre Dame, the yellow-and-green shop sign could just be glimpsed on the other side of the river.By then, I'd been in Paris a month, long enough to hear vague rumors about the legendary bookstore. I'd been intrigued, of course, and had often meant to visit. Yet as I crossed the bridge, with the wind whipping at my pant legs and umbrellas sprouting around me, these rumors were far from mind. My only thought was to escape the storm and idle the rainy minutes away.Out in front of the store, a tour group bravely posed for one last round of photographs. They used thick guidebooks to shield their cameras and their teeth were clenched into chattering smiles. Onewoman glared from beneath the hood of a rain slicker as her husband twisted a complicated lens. "Hurry," she urged. "Just hurry."Through the fog of the shop's main window, there could be seen a blur of warm light and moving bodies. To the left stood a narrow wooden door, its green paint wrinkled and chipped. With a faint creak, it swung open to reveal a modest delirium.A glittering chandelier hung from a cracked wooden ceiling beam, while in the corner an obese man squeezed rainwater from his turquoise muumuu. A horde of customers circled the desk, clamoring for the clerk's attention in a loud mash of languages. And the books. The books were everywhere. They sagged from wooden shelves, spilled from cardboard boxes, teetered in tall piles on tables and chairs. Stretched along the windowsill and taking in this mad scene was a silky black cat. I swear it looked up at me and winked.There was a sudden spray of wind as the tour group pushed inside the store. I was bounced forward, past the crowded desk, then up two stone stairs painted with the words LIVE FOR HUMANITY and through into a large central room. Here, tables and shelves overflowed with more books, two doorways led deeper into the store, and a murky skylight was set overhead. Most unusual was what this skylight cast down upon: an iron-rimmed wishing well, where a man on bended knee was clawing out coins of high denomination. As I approached, he glared up at me and quickly shielded his bounty with a crooked arm.Giving this fellow wide berth, I entered a narrow passage and found myself surrounded by books written in what appeared to be Russian. A wrong turn took me down a dead end to a sink surrounded by stacks of yellowed nature magazines. There was a soapy razor lying on an issue featuring the jungles of Madagascar. A dab of foam added an unnatural spot to a reclining leopard.Backing up, I arrived at a wall of German novels, then, stumbling slightly, there was another turn and a loose pyramid of glossy-covered art books. To one side was a stained-glass alcove with a bare bulb flickering inside. A woman was crouched there, muttering in Italian and trying to decipher the book titles in this shaky light.Finally, after stepping through another doorway, I was back in the room with the wishing well. The man who plunged his hand in the coins had vanished, but now the tour group had surged ahead and laid claim to the space. Half-blinded by flashing cameras, I was jostled among wet shoulders as they herded past me and into the very labyrinth from which I'd just emerged.It was at this juncture that I decided a caf� would be a calmer harbor from the storm. Making a cautious retreat past the clerk and the winking black cat, I went back out the green door. The sting of rain made me pause to reconsider, and as I stood huddled in the doorway, I noticed a wooden bookcase drilled into the wall beside the store window. The paperbacks were damp and bloated, but they cost just twenty-five francs, a sum even I could afford in those desperate days. A copy of <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> edged out at me. Guessing it would be an inexpensive way to swallow time, I ventured back inside.When it came my turn to be served, the young woman at the desk gave me a bright smile and folded open the cover of my book. With meticulous care, she stamped the title page with the crest of the Shakespeare and Company bookstore. Then she invited me upstairs for tea.TIME WAS SOFT THERE. Copyright � 2005 by Jeremy Mercer.

Roth watches as his eighty-six-year-old father&#x2014;famous for his vigor, charm, and his repertoire of Newark recollections&#x2014;battles with the brain tumor that will kill him. The son, full of love, anxiety, and dread, accompanies his father through each fearful stage of his final ordeal, and, as he does so, discloses the survivalist tenacity that has distinguished his father's long, stubborn engagement with life.</p><p>With the honesty of a skilled biographer and the sensitivity of a caring son, Roth chronicles the life of his father, Herman, in this gripping work which won a 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award. Roth holds little back in describing his father as a man of rare intensity and fierce independence who, for better or worse, stood by his principles and held others to his own rigorous standards. Writes Roth, &#34;His obsessive stubbornness--his stubborn obsessiveness--had very nearly driven my mother to a breakdown in her final years.&#34; Frank throughout, Roth calls his father &#34;a pitiless realist, but I wasn&#39;t his offspring for nothing, and I could be pretty realistic, too.&#34;"A tough-minded, beautifully written memoir. . . . It smacks of honesty and truthfulness on every page." &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"A deeply resonant portrait of a father and son. . . .

This well-organized book is divided into 13 sections-one for each of the colonies. Each section begins with a brief history of the colony, including its industries, population, and notable persons during the years leading up to and during the American Revolution. A map and a chart listing the vital statistics of the signers complete the introduction to each chapter. Next, information about their backgrounds, their contributions to America's independence, and their lives after signing the Declaration is presented. None of the primary facts or dates has been neglected, yet the lively style of the text maintains readers' interest. The full text of the document is included.

The cold was making my skin prickle and my teeth chatter, yet I didn't move. If I stayed, maybe time would stand still. Maybe the morning wouldn't happen.

May his reign bring joy to all, but especially to the library's assistant director, since she's sitting across the table from me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Graydon," I said. "His name is Graydon Cain."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The poor man. What were his parents thinking? I wonder what his friends call him? Gray?" She raised one eyebrow. "Don?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe it's a family name and they call him Junior."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Frances snorted. "Surely your nimble mind has a better suggestion than that. You're not getting sick, are you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If only," I muttered, but not loud enough for her to hear. When Graydon had interviewed with the library board a few months back, I'd made the event memorable by walking backward into the then-president of the board, falling to the floor, and strewing the contents of my backpack all across the lobby.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bad as that had been, it had been far worse to have Eddie hack up a hair ball on the Italian shoes of the woman the board chose as the library's director. An early-and heavy-October snowfall had sent Jennifer scuttling back south and the board had gone to Graydon, metaphorical hat in hand, and asked him to consider making northwest lower Michigan his new home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well," my aunt said reasonably, "Graydon can't be any worse than that frightful woman."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sighed. "You'd think so, but I wouldn't have thought anyone could be worse than Stephen." My former boss, who'd had the personality of a doorstop and a deep reluctance to agree to any change in anything whatsoever, hadn't inspired deep loyalty in his staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It'll be fine," Aunt Frances said comfortably. Of course, she could be comfortable about the whole thing; she hadn't had a new boss in ages. Her fall-to-spring job was as a woodworking instructor at the local community college, and the college president was in fine fettle and likely to stay that way. In summer, she opened up the big house she'd inherited from her long-passed-away husband to eight hand-picked boarders. Or rather, that's what she'd done for years and years. This summer it was all going to be different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most of me was thrilled about the upcoming events, but part of me had a kinship with Stephen and his dislike of change. I'd loved the boardinghouse since, starting at age twelve, my busy parents had sent me north from June to August. Every group of boarders was unique and every summer had brought new adventures. I didn't want the evening tradition of cooking marshmallows in the living room's fieldstone fireplace to end. I didn't want the bookshelf full of board games and jigsaw puzzles to be moved. I didn't want the screened porch off the dining room to sprout new furniture, and I certainly didn't want anyone to decide the wide pine-paneled walls needed to be covered with drywall and papered over with some floral print.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't," my aunt said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked up. "Don't what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Think whatever it is you're thinking." Before I could disagree, she added, "And don't bother denying that you're thinking things you shouldn't be thinking about. If it's about that Graydon, quit worrying. If it's about this summer, quit worrying. It'll all work out, one way or another, and worrying doesn't help one bit."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know, but-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Stop," she said firmly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Aunt Frances was the sanest person I knew, and since she'd been right the other zillion times in my life when she told me to quit worrying, I said, "You're right. Again." I'd stop. Or at least try to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a reason you're my favorite niece," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm your only niece."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Then isn't it wonderful that we found each other?" She grinned. And since my aunt's grins were hard to resist, I grinned back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mrr!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, Eddie," I said, patting the top of his head. "It's wonderful that I found you, too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He glanced up at me, and I got the impression that he was mentally switching the pronouns in that sentence. Almost two years ago, on an unseasonably warm April morning, I'd skipped out on cleaning chores and instead wandered through the local cemetery, enjoying the view of the twenty-mile-long Janay Lake and the horizontal blue line of Lake Michigan just over the hills to the west. My quiet walk had been interrupted by a black-and-gray tabby cat who had materialized next to the gravesite of Alonzo Tillotson, born 1847, died 1926.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd assumed the cat had a home and tried to shoo him away, but he'd followed me back to town, much to the amusement of passersby. Since I'd known nothing about cats due to my father's allergies, I'd taken him to the local veterinarian, who said my new friend (a black-and-white tabby once he'd been cleaned up) was about two years old. The "Found Cat" notice I'd run in the newspaper had gone unanswered, and Eddie and I were now pals for life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's going to be different, that's all," I said, letting my hand rest on Eddie's warm back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Different isn't necessarily bad." Aunt Frances scraped her spoon against the bottom of her bowl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know. It's just . . ." I sighed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Going to be different." My aunt nodded. "I understand, my sweet. I really do. You're getting a new boss. Cousin Celeste is buying the boardinghouse. Otto and I are getting married in Bermuda, I'm moving across the street, and you're-" She stopped. "What are you doing? Have you made a decision about the houseboat?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook my head. A few years ago I'd been lucky enough to have been offered the assistant director job at the Chilson District Library. The job paid what you might expect, and since housing in the summer resort town of Chilson was not what you'd call affordable, my living arrangements were, by necessity, creative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>October through April, I lived with my aunt in the rambling boardinghouse, but come May, I moved to a boat slip in Uncle Chip's Marina to spend the summer in the cutest little houseboat imaginable. But this May, someone else other than Aunt Frances was going to open the boardinghouse, and I wouldn't be moving back here in the fall, or ever again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I hear," my aunt said, "that Rafe is looking for wide walnut planks to do the entry floor."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hmm." A smile spread across my face. A few weeks earlier, I'd come to the shocking realization that Rafe Niswander-who I'd known since I was twelve years old, who infuriated me on a regular basis, who often displayed the sense of humor of a nine-year-old, and who took every opportunity to display stupidity in spite of his multiple college degrees and successful position as a middle school principal-was, in fact, the love of my life. Happily, this realization almost completely coincided with Rafe's confession that he'd been in love with me for years, and that he'd just been waiting for the right time to own up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which, as it turned out, was during a critical time. Rafe had spent years fixing up an old shingle-style house and his confession had occurred when he'd said he'd been renovating it for me all along, but that it was time for kitchen design decisions and he'd needed my input.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't decided," I told Aunt Frances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"About the walnut?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I ignored the question, which had to be rhetorical. She knew perfectly well that I had as much interest in the types of wood Rafe bought as I did in kitchen design, which was to say none.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"About selling the houseboat," I said. "If I sell it, I could pay off my last student loan, but once it's gone, it's gone, like oatmeal on a snowy January morning." I reached across the table for her empty bowl. "Thank you for making breakfast. I appreciate the celebration and hope the day deserves it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Frances watched as I carried the dishes to the sink. "Celeste sent me an e-mail last night. Shall I read it to you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, please." The e-mails from Celeste Glendennie, the cousin in Nevada buying the boardinghouse, were terse, choppy, informative, and often very funny. My parents claimed I'd met her at a family reunion, but I couldn't summon up a single memory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My aunt reached out for her cell phone, which was sitting on the kitchen counter. After a few screen taps, she said, "Quoting: Is boardinghouse one word or two? Inquiring minds want to know. Mine does, too." Aunt Frances put down the phone. "She's going to be here the last week of April to get started. Are you planning on being gone by then?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If I recall correctly, your houseboat doesn't have central heating. Did you ask Eddie how he feels about living in below-freezing temperatures?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I glanced at my furry friend, who was now standing with his back feet on the seat of his chair and his front feet on the windowsill, staring at an outside that would be dark for another hour. "Rafe says the house will be done by mid-April."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Frances hooted with laughter. "And you believed him? Don't look like that, dear heart. I'm sure he thinks he's being realistic, but my money's on October."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Can't be October," I said. "I ran into Chris the other day and Uncle Chip himself has decided it's time to update the marina. They're going to pull out all the piers and put in new ones right after Labor Day." Though Chris was part owner and manager of the marina, his great uncle was the marina's patriarch, and his wish was Chris's command.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My aunt put a hand on my shoulder. "Poor Minnie. What are you going to do with all this change being foisted upon you? How will you endure?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"With luck and grace," I told her. "And if that can't happen, with fortitude and a smile. But even without any of that, I'll endure with-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mrr."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As per usual, he was right on cue. "With Eddie."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An hour later, the outgoing library board president, octogenarian Otis Rahn, looked at me over the top of his glasses. �Now, Minnie, I have every confidence in you, but I want you to promise that this year will be a rousing success.�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't easy for me to keep from doing a fidgety squirm, and I tried to forget how much I disliked making promises regarding things that were primarily out of my control and instead focused on how much I loved my job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course, Otis," I said, smiling and nodding at the two new faces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Graydon, our new director. Trent, our new board president. Two names out of an East Coast prep school alumni directory and they had the looks to match. Both had thin faces and smooth hair cut to a professional length. Both wore slacks, jacket, and no tie-clothing completely appropriate for a formal Up North meeting in January. Both had greeted me with firm handshakes and friendly smiles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was no reason for me to dislike them. None whatsoever. But I would have preferred a hint of awe in their demeanor. Not at me, of course, but at our surroundings. For decades, the Chilson District Library had been stuffed into a concrete block structure that had the aesthetics of a bunker. With the magic of an easily passed millage vote, a historic-and empty-elementary school had been lovingly renovated into a building that was a point of pride for the entire community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The architects had taken advantage of the building's Arts and Crafts style and had revitalized its miles of interior wood trim. They'd added large square tile flooring to the lobby and wide hallways. The reading room had a fireplace and window seats. Colored metallic tiles highlighted everything from drinking fountains to directional signs. What had been the school gymnasium now housed the bulk of the library's books, with custom-made oak tables and lamps that invited people to sit and stay. Every time I walked into the building, its beauty almost took my breath away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even now, the view from the second-floor boardroom of picturesque downtown Chilson and Janay Lake was gorgeous. Sure, everything was covered with a fresh layer of snow and the lake was frozen, but if you lived in northwest lower Michigan year-round, your mental health depended on finding beauty in winter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Looking forward to working with you," Trent Ross said politely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Likewise," Graydon said. The only person I'd ever heard use that word in conversation was a long-ago college professor who had tried to teach me statistics, and hearing it from my new boss did not summon happy memories. "And I'm looking forward to having more meetings," he said, nodding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Otis gazed at him. "My boy, don't make the board regret hiring you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Graydon laughed. "I was being a bit facetious. It's this room." He nodded at the wood-paneled walls, the long corporate-looking table, and the blotters placed in front of every chair. "It makes me feel that important things are being discussed. It makes me feel dignified."</p></p><h2>Money: A Suicide Note (Penguin Ink)</h2><p><b>One of <i>Time</i>&#x2019;s 100 best novels in the English language&#x2014;by the acclaimed author of <i>Lionel Asbo: State of England</i> and <i>London Fields</i></b><p></p><p>Part of Martin Amis&#x2019;s &#x201c;London Trilogy,&#x201d; along with the novel <i>London Fields</i> and <i>The Information</i>, <i>Money</i> was hailed as "a sprawling, fierce, vulgar display" (<i>The New Republic</i>) and "exhilarating, skillful, savvy" (<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>) when it made its first appearance in the mid-1980s.

Knight is a street-smart poet with an ear for the Black American idiom and experience, and his poems reflect a life lived largely at the cutting edge edge of that experience: poverty, racism, prison, drug addiction, and rehabilitation. Whether in the form of incantatory blues, narrative poems, or his distinctly individual urban haiku, Knight&#x2019;s is a compelling voice.&#x201d;<br><i>--Seattle Times</i><br><br><p>"To read Knight is not to escape from or to transfigure America. It really isn't a 'comfortable' experience. He is too aware of the violent spaces between races and individuals to attempt grandiloquescence. Equally he is too screwed into the mundane to attempt sleight of hand tricks. His poetry is clarified on the oilstone of experience. The sad, funky, yet celebrative sound of his 'blues' is experience being honed on the quartz grains of a grindstone."</p><p><i>&#x2014;The Iowa Review</i></p>This book presents about a dozen new poems by a foremost American poet in the black oral tradition. The bulk of these poems appeared in Born of a Woman ( LJ 6/15/80), a superior volume with many more poems and a sensitive preface that illustrates the full range of Knight's stunning ability with the vernacular. Knight can move from pathos and a near-tragic vision of the destructiveness of imprisonment and prejudice to tenderness and a lusty, incisive wit. His new poems have less substance and are fewer than one would expect from someone with his talent, but the work as a whole bears testimony anew to his authentic "blues" voice, deep feeling, and concern for communication between the races.Frank Allen, Assoc.

It centers on one of the most psychological movements of the prescientific age&#x2015;Renaissance Italy, where a group of &#x201c;inner Columbuses&#x201d; charted territories that still give us today a much- needed sense of who we are and where we have come from, and the right routes to take toward fertile and unexplored places. <br><br> Chief among these masters of the interior life was Marsilio Ficino, presiding genius of the Florentine Academy, who taught that all things exist in soul and must be lived in its light. This study of Ficino broadens and deepens our understanding of psyche, for Ficino was a doctor of soul, and his insights teach us the care and nurture of soul. <br><br> Moore takes as his guide Ficino&#x2019;s own fundamental tool&#x2015;imagination. Respecting the integrity and autonomy of images, <i>The Planets Within</i> unfolds a poetics of soul in a kind of dialogue between the laconic remarks of Ficino and the need to give these remarks a life and context for our day.</p><p><b>Thomas Moore</b> is the author of <i>Care of the Soul,</i> which spent forty-six weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, and fifteen other books on deepening spirituality and cultivating the soul in every aspect of life.

However, with this increased visibility has come not just power, but regulation, both in favor of and against trans people. What was once regarded as an unusual or even unfortunate disorder has become an accepted articulation of gendered embodiment as well as a new site for political activism and political recognition. What happened in the last few decades to prompt such an extensive rethinking of our understanding of gendered embodiment? How did a stigmatized identity become so central to U.S. and European articulations of self? And how have people responded to the new definitions and understanding of sex and the gendered body? In&nbsp;<i>Trans*,</i> Jack Halberstam explores these recent shifts in the meaning of the gendered body and representation, and explores the possibilities of a nongendered, gender-optional, or gender-queer future.</p><p>&#x201c;This lively and smart book by Jack Halberstam offers a new way of approaching the politics of &#x2018;naming, claiming, speech, silence, and protest&#x2019; through an analysis of grammar, language use, social media, stories, poetry, theory, and film that foreground the multiple meanings of the trans* body. This is the treatise on the asterisks for which we have been waiting, blending academic and popular discourse in that Halberstam way. This book offers an incisive way of understanding trans* in relation to inventive world-making, the promises and dangers of state recognition and new forms of tolerance, and the imperative to keep our lenses wide enough to embrace a field of multiplicity. Halberstam navigates the tensions between trans* theory and feminism, its relation to inter-generational misprision, and the pervasive problem of white presumption that effaces the different histories, life narratives, and orientations to space, time, and the legacies of violence that vector through trans*. Some may worry that trans* does not give space enough to trans without the asterisks, but Halberstam seeks to broaden the category in the direction of inclusiveness, insisting that we understand the different modalities of violence as well as aesthetic forms of invention the belong to trans*. The book cracks open a future, resisting transphobia and ushering in a new horizon for anybody struggling with the norms they oppose and the forms of life they desire and deserve to live.&#x201d;&#x2014;Judith Butler, author of&nbsp;<i>Gender Trouble:&nbsp;Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i><br><br> &#x201c;If <i>Trans*</i> were simply a compressed, learned primer about gender variability for audiences of all kinds, it would be important enough. But Jack Halberstam here offers us something more&#x2014;a supremely lucid explication of highly complex and controversial ideas, cultural artifacts, and histories that never dumbs down nor gets lost in the weeds. I particularly appreciate its ranginess, perspective, sense of humor, autobiographical anecdotes, and critical dedication to &#x2018;putting pressure on all modes of gendered embodiment.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Maggie Nelson, author of&nbsp;<i>The Argonauts</i><br><br> &#x201c;Jack&nbsp;Halberstam drills down to the culture&#x2019;s defining characteristics of the gendered body and proceeds to unravel the interconnected nature of the gendered mind.

John Huth asks what is lost when modern technology substitutes for our innate capacity to find our way. Encyclopedic in breadth, weaving together astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, and ethnography, <i>The Lost Art of Finding Our Way</i> puts us in the shoes, ships, and sleds of early navigators for whom paying close attention to the environment around them was, quite literally, a matter of life and death.</p><p>Haunted by the fate of two young kayakers lost in a fogbank off Nantucket, Huth shows us how to navigate using natural phenomena&#x2015;the way the Vikings used the sunstone to detect polarization of sunlight, and Arab traders learned to sail into the wind, and Pacific Islanders used underwater lightning and &#x201c;read&#x201d; waves to guide their explorations. Huth reminds us that we are all navigators capable of learning techniques ranging from the simplest to the most sophisticated skills of direction-finding. Even today, careful observation of the sun and moon, tides and ocean currents, weather and atmospheric effects can be all we need to find our way.</p><p>Lavishly illustrated with nearly 200 specially prepared drawings, Huth&#x2019;s compelling account of the cultures of navigation will engross readers in a narrative that is part scientific treatise, part personal travelogue, and part vivid re-creation of navigational history. Seeing through the eyes of past voyagers, we bring our own world into sharper view.</p></p><p>John Edward Huth is Donner Professor of Science in the Physics Department at Harvard University.&#x201c;One of the repeated themes of <i>The Lost Art of Finding Our Way</i> is that even the most confused of us can improve our navigational understanding by paying closer attention to the world around us...

And that&#x2019;s one of Huth&#x2019;s central points: To find your way in a world without maps, you can&#x2019;t rely on any single cue&#x2015;you need to make the best of whatever combination of cues is available to you... With a little study, <i>The Lost Art of Finding Our Way</i> could be your guide to reconnecting with the navigational aids in the world around you.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Greg Miller</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wired</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;John Huth&#x2019;s <i>The Lost Art of Finding Our Way</i> is a book for anyone who&#x2019;s ever cursed themselves for not being able to get home by way of the stars and winds.

Huth is concerned that we have become desensitized to our physical environment because of technology such as smartphones and global positioning systems, which do the work of plotting and routefinding for us. To live in what Huth dubs &#x2018;the bubble&#x2019; created by such devices is to lose not only our wonder at the world but also a bundle of precious survival skills.

It provides both a primer on navigational techniques and a tour through &#x2018;the historical evolution of way finding.&#x2019; Huth punctuates instruction on celestial navigation and reading wind, weather, and currents with engaging stories and images. These are derived from sources as varied as the oral histories of Pacific Islanders and Inuit hunters, Homer&#x2019;s <i>Odyssey</i>, Icelandic sagas, navigational tables from the medieval Islamic world, and contemporary news reports and sailing accounts.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Deirdre Lockwood</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Humanity&#x2019;s lust for exploring <i>terra incognita</i> shaped and tested our prodigious capacity for mental mapping.

In <i>The Ego Tunnel</i>, philosopher Thomas Metzinger claims otherwise: No such thing as a <i>self</i> exists. The conscious self is the content of a model created by our brain an internal image, but one we cannot experience <i>as</i> an image. Everything we experience is a virtual self in a virtual reality.&#x201d;<p>But if the self is not real,&#x201d; why and how did it evolve? How does the brain construct it? Do we still have souls, free will, personal autonomy, or moral accountability? In a time when the science of cognition is becoming as controversial as evolution, <i>The Ego Tunnel</i> provides a stunningly original take on the mystery of the mind.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Metzinger</b> directs the Theoretical Philosophy Group at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, and is an Adjunct Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Study. He is the former president of the German Cognitive Science Society and one of the founders of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. He has written and edited eight books, among them <i>Being No One</i>; <i>Conscious Experience</i>; and <i>Neural Correlates of Consciousness</i>. He lives in Germany.Consciousness, mind, brain, self: the relations among these four entities are explored by German cognitive scientist and theoretical philosopher Metzinger, who argues that, in fact, there is no such thing as a self. In prose accessible mainly to those schooled in philosophy and science, Metzinger defines the ego as the phenomenal self, which knows the world experientially as it subjectively <i>appear[s]</i> to you. But neuroscientific experiments have demonstrated, among other things, that the unitary sense of self is a subjective representation: for instance, one can be fooled into feeling sensations in a detached artificial arm. So the author argues that the ego is a tunnel that bores into reality and limits what you can see, hear, smell and feel. Metzinger tests his theory by ranging over events of the consciousness such as out-of-body experiences, lucid dreaming and free will, and he concludes by probing ethical actions and what a good state of consciousness would look like. Most readers will have difficulty penetrating Metzinger's ideas, and those who do will find little that is genuinely new. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nicholas, youngest son of Prince Arutha of Krondor is intelligent and gifted, but vastly inexperienced in worldly matters. In hopes of hardening him, his father sends him and his squire, Harry, to live at rustic Castle Crydee to learn of life beyond the halls of privilege. Thus begins the most harrowing experience of their young lives. Within weeks of Nicholas&#39;s arrival, Crydee is viciously attacked by assailants unknown. The result: murder, massive destruction, and the abduction of two young noblewomen, friends to the prince. And Crydee isn&#39;t the only town that&#39;s been hit - towns up and down the coast have suffered the same merciless devastation. From out of the wreckage two facts become clear. The raiders have come from the distant Sunset Islands, home to pirates of every stripe - and possibly even farther away than that. But more significant, these are no ordinary pirates: their mission is connected to dark magical forces that have threatened the Kingdom before. As brother to the future king, Nicholas feels compelled to follow the abductors and rescue those taken from Crydee - but the threat he ultimately faces is one that places the fate of all of his people in his inexperienced lands.Raymond E.

Compared to works by Voltaire and Zola on its original publication, this prescient novel strives to awaken an often unsuspecting, sometimes politically naive, or else willfully blind world to the consequences of its stance in the face of national events--in this case, the rising tide of Nazism in 1930s Germany. The past and future meet in the saga of the Oppermanns, for three generations a family commercially well established in Berlin. In assimilated citizens like them, the emancipated Jew in Germany has become a fact. In a Berlin inhabited by troops in brown shirts, however, the Oppermanns have more to fear than an alien discomfort.

Bartlett Giamatti</h2><p>With a foreword by David Halberstam. He spoke out against player trading. He banned Pete Rose from baseball for gambling. He even asked sports fans to clean up their acts. Bart Giamatti was baseball&#39;s Renaissance man and its commissioner. In A Great And Glorious Game, a collection of spirited, incisive essays, Giamatti reflects on the meaning of the game. Baseball, for him, was a metaphor for life. He artfully argues that baseball is much more than an American &#34;pastime.&#34; &#34;Baseball is about going home,&#34; he wrote, &#34;and how hard it is to get there and how driven is our need.&#34; And in his powerful 1989 decision to ban Pete Rose from baseball, Giamatti states that no individual is superior to the game itself, just as no individual is superior to our democracy. A Great And Glorious Game is a thoughtful meditation on baseball, character, and values by one of the most eloquent men in the world of sport.</p><p>By far the most literate of baseball&#39;s commissioners, the late Bart Giamatti, former president of Yale, was the game&#39;s most unashamedly vocal fan both before and during his tenure as chief executive. The child of immigrants, he embraced baseball&#39;s very Americanness, and ascribed to its simple goal--coming home--a far-reaching, overall metaphor. His ardor was unguarded and unabashed, his approach sentimental and as expansive as a pair of foul lines diverging in the distance. Giamatti&#39;s oversized passion infuses everything in this slim volume, from his wistful elegy to Tom Seaver and his admonition to fans to clean up their act, to his pained public statement banning Pete Rose from the game for life. Best of all, his seductively lyrical essay &#34;The Green Fields of the Mind&#34; leads off the lineup. The latter alone--it begins by poignantly observing of baseball, &#34;It breaks your heart. It&#39;s designed to break your heart&#34;--is worth the price of admission.Giamatti was to the Commissioner&#39;s office what Sandy Koufax was to the pitcher&#39;s mound: Giamatti&#39;s career had the highest ratio of excellence to longevity.</p><h2>From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement (Critical America, 34)</h2><p><p><b>A critical look at the movement for environmental justice</b></p><p>When Bill Clinton signed an Executive Order on Environmental Justice in 1994, the phenomenon of environmental racism&#x2015;the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards, particularly toxic waste dumps and polluting factories, on people of color and low-income communities&#x2015;gained unprecedented recognition.

With their stunning good looks, whip-sharp minds, athletic bodies -- and no lack of women who adored them -- none of them seemed slated for disaster. <br> But few knew the reality behind the leafy screen that surrounded Seven Cedars, Scott's woodland dream home -- a tree house equipped with every luxury. From this idyllic enclave, some of these trusted friends would become the quarry for a vigilant Seattle police detective and an FBI special agent, who unmasked clues to disturbing secrets that spawned murder, suicide, million-dollar bank robberies, drug-dealing, and heartbreaking betrayal. When the end came in a violent stand-off, the ringleader of the foursome -- the fugitive dubbed "Hollywood" for his ingenious disguises and flawless getaways; the persuasive talker who turned his friends into accomplices -- faced a final chapter no one could have predicted. In a blast of automatic gunfire, the highest and lowest motives of the human heart were, at last, revealed. <br> Along with four other true-crime tales, <i>The End of the Dream</i> is a masterful and compelling tour of the criminal mind from Ann Rule.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.<b>Chapter One</b><br>In Seattle, Washington, Thanksgiving is only rarely celebrated under a brilliant blue sky and against a landscape rife with autumn colors. More often than not, the holiday seems to draw memorably violent storms to the Northwest. Many a turkey has been coaxed to semidoneness on an outdoor barbeque because power lines are down. Wednesday, November 27, 1996, was the day before Thanksgiving; the weather was wildly rainy and stormy, with gusts of wind stripping the trees of their last few leaves. Whatever smothered sun there had been that day had long since set, the streets were coils of shiny black, reflecting yellow streetlights and the red, green, and silver of Christmas lights.<br>Late customers hurried into the Lake City Branch of Seafirst Bank only eighteen minutes before closing. More than a dozen people stood patiently in the long lines, most of them so intent on the errands they still needed to run that they were unaware of what was going on around them.<br>The bank's automatic cameras kept clicking away as they always did, silent, mindless and mechanical. One camera snapped everyone coming in the door,another caught the bored or impatient faces of people waiting in line for a teller, while another scanned the entire bank. A fourth was aimed away from the tellers' cages toward a central island where customers stood writing out deposit and withdrawal slips. Each frame of the film noted the camera's number, the bank's ID number and name, the date, and the time to the second.<br>Camera 1-06 recorded the time at 5:42:13 P.M. at the instant a figure appeared at the far right of the frame. From a distance, he seemed only slightly bizarre; he wore both a hooded rain jacket and a baseball cap. A casual observer saw a man past middle age with gray hair; a full, drooping gray moustache; and a prominent chin. His dark glasses seemed odd, considering that the sun had set more than an hour before, and his wide, garish necktie was in dubious taste. He wore cheap tennis shoes, the low black canvas type that predated Nikes and Adidas. A closer look revealed that the body beneath the bulky jacket was too toned to belong to a man in his fifties, and he moved with an almost pantherlike grace. He had to be either an athlete or a dancer.<br>The camera clicked off seconds and the man approached a line of people. They looked at him with startled eyes and then averted their glances as considerate people do when they realize they are looking at someone with a handicap. Although the man's stride was confident, his face wasn't normal. He appeared to have suffered serious facial burns, and he was wearing either heavy makeup to cover scars or a rubbery mask to prevent additional scarring.<br>Here, in this neighborhood bank, no one expected trouble. The robot lenses caught their expressions as the odd-looking man cut between customers waiting in line. One man had an embarrassed half-smile on his face, a woman's eyes shifted momentarily, and a girl covered her mouth with her hand. What they were feeling was just a tingle of alarm. Nothing overtly frightening had been said or done. It was a little rude of the scarred man to slide between people in line, but it wasn't as if he were crowding in. He moved through, toward the back of the bank.<br>They didn't see the gun. They didn't see the holster strapped under his shoulder nor the knife or the extra gun strapped to his ankle. They certainly didn't see the other strange-looking man. The second man was quite tall, over six feet, and close to two hundred pounds. He wore a khaki parka with a light brown hood. His skin also had a masklike appearance, and he had a bushy moustache, too. The teller closest to him saw that he wore beige gloves and lace-up allweather boots.<br>Eyewitnesses are far from reliable, particularly when they are stunned and frightened eyewitnesses. Human perception is skewed by so many things, and people recall height inaccurately more often than not. A man who is frightening may be remembered as being much taller than he really is. "Young" or "old" is relative to the age of the witness. These two strangers would be described as anywhere from "thirty" to "over fifty." Only their eyes were visible beneath their masks and theatrical makeup.<br>The first man pushed past a bank customer, walked up to a teller, and said, "Step back. Stay away from the counter. This is a robbery."<br>Of course. Of course it was; why else would there be <i>two</i> bizarre-looking men in the bank?<br>The middle-aged male customer must have looked terrified, because the bank robber leaned toward him and said gently, "Don't panic. Stay calm. This is a robbery."<br>At that point, as if to emphasize his words, he pulled a black handgun about six inches long from his parka. "I'm serious," he said. "If you're nervous, please step out of line and sit down."<br>The customer and his wife walked gingerly out into the central lobby area and sat down in the easy chairs there. Now, they saw the second man and, when he moved, they caught a glimpse of a gun beneath his jacket that looked like the one the first bank robber held. Although he motioned people to get in line, he didn't use the gun to threaten them.<br>The first man was efficiently herding everyone from the tellers' lines out into the main part of the bank. He seemed to be in charge; he had an energy field around him that was fraught with danger.<br>The second, taller, man was very polite, very calm. When he spoke, it was with a southern-sounding drawl. He addressed women respectfully as "Ma'am." The first man, the one in the wild tie, had physically pushed the teller away from the counter. He appeared to be working against a clock.<br>Neither seemed worried that someone might walk in and interrupt the bank robbery. The bank doors remained unlocked, and new customers actually walked into the bank, unaware that anything was wrong. The tall bank robber had obviously been given the job of controlling the customers and staff. He gestured courteously as he asked people to move into the middle of the bank or into lines in front of the tellers' cubicles. Everyone complied. From the outside, it would look as if business was being carried on as usual.<br>The smaller man's voice boomed throughout the quiet bank. "Who is the vault teller?"<br>He seemed to know the inner workings of a bank and the duties of the staff. The big money would surely be in the vault.<br>A bank employee stepped up and said, "I'm the vault teller. I'll go with you." He led the way through the gate into the tellers' area.<br>It seemed a very long time before the two men emerged from the vault. Some witnesses thought it was ten minutes; some thought it was half that time. When they came out, the robber who was choreographing the crime carried a shiny blue duffel bag with a rope tied tight at the opening. He tossed it over the gate, and then placed one hand on a low partition and leapt over it effortlessly. Again, his physical agility was incongruous with his gray hair and moustache.<br>Now, those closest could see that he carried a handheld walkie-talkie radio. He spoke into the radio, saying what sounded like, "Did <i>you</i> hear anything?" or "Is <i>she</i> here?"<br>And then they were gone. One customer insisted on following the two bank robbers -- despite the pleadings of the others. He ran out into the darkness beyond the streetlights. Inside, they waited with dread, expecting to hear shots. But none came.<br>No one but the vault teller suspected that they had all just been part of one of the biggest bank robberies in Northwest history. In less than fifteen minutes, the robbers had managed to carry away more money than most people make in a lifetime.<br>This was not the first time that these robbers had struck Northwest banks. Far from it. This was at least the <i>twentieth</i> bank hit. The shorter man had become the quarry -- and the focal point of ultimate frustration -- for some of the most skilled investigators in the Seattle Police Department and the Seattle FBI Office. Just when predictable patterns and a distinctive MO began to emerge, he would slip through the invisible net that had been laid out for him. He and any accomplice he brought with him were wraithlike; it was almost as if they ran from the banks and vaporized.<br>No one knew who they were or what they looked like without their masks. They had to live somewhere; there were probably people who loved them and worried about them. Somewhere, probably within fifty miles of Seattle, they quite likely lived outwardly normal lives.<br>For the moment, they were known only by the profile they had filled in with their actions and their disguises. The investigators tracking them knew more about who they weren't than who they were.<br><br>Copyright � 1999 by Ann Rule</p><h2>Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Aristotle</h2><p>Soon after its publication, <i>Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy</i> was hailed as the favorite to become "the 'standard' text for survey courses in ancient philosophy."<b>*</b> More than twenty years later that prediction has been borne out: <i>Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy</i> still stands as the leading anthology of its kind.

David remembers this after her death when his father remarries and they move into his stepmother's home. There the strange books in his room begin to murmur, and he's lured into a dark fairy tale world by his dead mother's voice. Crossley's characterizations provide the believability needed to convey us into this frightening fantasy. The Woodsman, whom David meets first, has a voice that's gruff and rough--but, like David, we trust him. Crossley's ferocious reading makes us fear the evil half-human half-wolf, Leroi Loup. We hope that David learns enough to escape the gruesome story he's somehow helped to create.

In each of these ten unforgettable stories, Claire Vaye Watkins writes her way fearlessly into the mythology of the American West, utterly reimagining it. Her characters orbit around the region's vast spaces, winning redemption despite - and often because of - the hardship and violence they endure. The arrival of a foreigner transforms the exchange of eroticism and emotion at a prostitution ranch. A prospecting hermit discovers the limits of his rugged individualism when he tries to rescue an abused teenager. Decades after she led her best friend into a degrading encounter in a Vegas hotel room, a woman feels the aftershock. Most bravely of all, Watkins takes on &#x2013; and reinvents&nbsp;&#x2013; her own troubled legacy in a story that emerges from the mayhem and destruction of Helter Skelter. Arcing from the sweeping and sublime to the minute and personal, from Gold Rush to ghost town to desert to brothel, the collection echoes not only in its title but also in its fierce, undefeated spirit the motto of her home state.</p><p><b><b>Claire Vaye Watkins</b>&nbsp;</b>is the author of <i>Battleborn</i>, winner of the Story Prize, the Rosenthal Family Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Silver Pen Award from the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. <i>Battleborn </i>was named a Best Book of 2012 by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, <i>Time Out New York</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Flavorwire</i>,&nbsp;and a Best Short Story Collection by NPR.org.

At the end, I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about beginnings.<br><br>The city of Reno, Nevada, was founded in 1859 when Charles Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River and charged prospectors to haul their Comstock silver across the narrow but swift-moving current. Two years later, Fuller sold the bridge to the ambitious Myron Lake. Lake, swift himself, added a gristmill, kiln and livery stable to his Silver Queen Hotel and Eating House. Not a bashful man, he named the community Lake&#x2019;s Crossing, had the name painted on Fuller&#x2019;s bridge, bright blue as the sky.<br><br>The 1860s were boom times in the western Utah Territory: Americans still had the brackish taste of Sutter&#x2019;s soil on their tongues, ten-year-old gold still glinting in their eyes. The curse of the Comstock Lode had not yet leaked from the silver vein, not seeped into the water table. The silver itself had not yet been stripped from the mountains, and steaming water had not yet ?ooded the mine shafts. Henry T. P. Comstock&#x2014;most opportune of the opportunists, snatcher of land, greatest claim jumper of all time&#x2014;had not yet lost his love Adelaide, his ?rst cousin, who drowned in Lake Tahoe. He had not yet traded his share of the lode for a bottle of whiskey and an old, blind mare, not yet blown his brains out with a borrowed revolver near Bozeman, Montana.<br><br>Boom times.<br><br>Lake&#x2019;s Crossing grew. At statehood in 1864, the district of Lake&#x2019;s Crossing, Washoe County, was consolidated with Roop County. By then, Lake&#x2019;s Crossing was the largest city in either. The curse, excavated from the silver vein and weighted by the heavy ore, settled on the nation&#x2019;s newest free state.<br><br>Or begin the story here: In 1881 Himmel Green, an architect, came to Reno from San Francisco to quietly divorce Mary Ann Cohen Magnin of the upscale women&#x2019;s clothing store I. Magnin and Company. Himmel took a liking to Reno and decided to stay. He started designing buildings for his friends, newly rich silver families.<br><br>Reno&#x2019;s Newlands Heights neighborhood is choked with Green&#x2019;s work. In 1909, 315 Lake Street was erected. A stout building made of brick, it was one of Himmel&#x2019;s ?rst residential buildings, a modest design, small porch off the back, simple awnings, thoroughly mediocre in every way. Some say construction at 315 Lake stirred up the cursed dust of the Comstock Lode. Though it contaminated everyone (and though we Nevadans still breathe it into ourselves today), they say it got to Himmel particularly, stuck to his blueprints, his clothing, formed a microscopic layer of silver dust on his skin. Glinting silver ?lm or no, after his divorce was ?nalized Himmel moved in with Leopold Karpeles, editor of the B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith Messenger. Their relationship was rumored a tumultuous one, mottled with abuse and in?delity. Still, they lived together until 1932, when the two were burned to death in a ?re at Karpeles&#x2019;s home, smoke rising from the house smelling like those miners boiled alive up in Virginia City mine shafts.<br><br>Or here. Here is as good a place as any: In March 1941, George Spahn, a dairyman and amateur beekeeper from Pennsylvania, signed over the deed to his sixty-acre farm to his son, Henry, packed four suitcases, his wife, Helen, and their old, foul-tempered calico cat, Bottles, into the car, and drove west to California, to the ocean.<br><br>He was to retire, bow out of the ranching business, bury his tired feet in the warm Western sand. But retirement didn&#x2019;t suit George. After two months he came home to their ticky-tacky rental on the beach and presented Helen with plans to buy a 511-acre ranch at 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road in the Santa Susana Mountains. The ranch was up for sale by its owner, the aging silent-?lm star William S. Hart.<br><br>The Santa Susana Mountains are drier than the more picturesque Santa Monica Mountains that line the California coast. Because they are not privy to the moist winds rolling in off the sea, they are susceptible to ? res. Twelve hundred Santa Susana Pass Road is tucked up in the Santa Susanas north of Los Angeles, off what is now called the Ronald Reagan Freeway. Back in 1941, when George was persuading Helen to move again, taking her knobby hand in his, begging her to uproot the tendrils she&#x2019;d so far managed to anchor into the loose beige sand of Manhattan Beach&#x2014;<i>Just a bit east this time</i>, sweet pea&#x2014;the city of Chatsworth was little more than a Baptist church, a dirt-clogged ?lling station, and the Palomino Horse Association&#x2019;s main stables, birthplace of Mr. Ed. Years later, in 1961, my father, still a boy, would start a wild?re in the hills above the PHA stables. He would be eleven, crouched in the dry brush, sneaking a cigarette. But let&#x2019;s not get ahead of ourselves.<br><br>At the heart of the ranch was a movie set, a thoroughfare of a Western boomtown: bank, saloon, blacksmith, wood-planked boardwalk, side streets and alleys, a jail. Perhaps the set dazzled Helen. Perhaps she&#x2014;a prematurely arthritic woman&#x2014;recalled the aching cold of Pennsylvania winters. Perhaps she spoiled her husband, as her children claim. Whatever the reason, Helen laid her hand on her husband&#x2019;s brow and said, &#x201c;All right, George.&#x201d; And though by all accounts Helen came to like the ranch, on the day George took her out to view the property for the ?rst time her journal reads:<br><br><i>The property is quite expansive, surrounded by mountains. </i><br><br><i>G. giddy as a boy. Not such a view as the beach, though. The road out is windy and narrow, sheer canyon walls on either side. Seems I am to be once again separated from the sea. And what a brief affair it was! Looking west I felt a twinge like something had been taken from me, something a part of me but never truly mine.</i><br><br>Within a week of the Spahns&#x2019; move up to 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road, Bottles the cat ran away.<br><br>But George was more adaptable than Bottles, and luckier. In 1941, Westerns were still Hollywood&#x2019;s bread and butter. George ran his movie set like he&#x2019;d run his dairy ranch, building strong relationships with decision makers, underpricing the competition. It certainly didn&#x2019;t hurt business when Malibu Bluff State Recreation Area annexed Trancas Canyon and sold off its many sets, making Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch the only privately owned&#x2014;and therefore zero-permit&#x2014;outdoor set for seventy-?ve miles. The Spahns enjoyed a steady stream of business from the major studios, charging them a pretty penny to rent horses and shoot ?lms at the ranch, among them High Noon, The Comstock Boys, and David O. Selznick&#x2019;s 1946 classic <i>Duel in the Sun</i>, starring Gregory Peck. TV shows were also shot at the ranch, including most episodes of The Lone Ranger and&#x2014;before Warner Brothers, coaxed by Nevada&#x2019;s tax incentives and the habits of its big-name directors, moved production to the Ponderosa Ranch at Lake Tahoe&#x2014;<i>Bonanza</i>.<br><br>We might start at my mother&#x2019;s ?rst memory: It&#x2019;s 1962. She is three. She sits on her stepfather&#x2019;s lap on a plastic lawn chair on the roof of their trailer. Her older brother and sister sit cross-legged on a bath towel they&#x2019;ve laid atop the chintzy two-tab roof, the terry cloth dimpling their skin. They each wear a pair of their mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;my grandmother&#x2019;s&#x2014;oversize Jackie O. sunglasses. It is dusk; in the eastern sky stars are coming into view&#x2014;yes, back then you could still see stars over Las Vegas&#x2014;but the family faces northwest, as do their neighbors and the teenage boys hired to cut and water the grass at the new golf courses and the city bus drivers who have pulled over to the side of the roads and the tourists up in their hotel rooms with their faces pressed to the windows. As does the whole city.<br><br>Their stepfather points to the desert. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; he says. A ?ash of light across the basin. An orange mushroom cloud erupts, rolling and boiling. Seconds later, she hears the boom of it, like a ?rework, and the trailer begins to sway. Impossibly, the heat warms my mother&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Makes you think,&#x201d; her stepfather says softly in her ear. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s something godly out there after all.&#x201d;<br><br>The blast is a 104-kiloton nuclear explosion. It blows a hole into the desert rock, creating the deepest crater of all the Nevada Test Site&#x2019;s 1,021 detonations: 320 feet deep. The crater displaces seven hundred tons of dirt and rock, including two tons of sediment from a vein of H. T. P. Comstock&#x2019;s cursed soil, a ?nger reaching all the way down the state, now blown sky-high in the blast. The July breeze is gentle, indecisive. It blows the radiation northeast, as it always does, to future cancer clusters in Fallon and Cedar City, Utah, to the mitosing cells of small-town downwinders. But today it also blows the curse southeast, toward Las Vegas, to my mother&#x2019;s small chest, her lungs and her heart. And it blows southwest, across the state line, all the way to the dry yellow mountains above Los Angeles. These particles settle, ?nally, at 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road.<br><br>We might start with George&#x2019;s longest year: For nearly twenty years, George&#x2019;s letters to his son, Henry, back home in Pennsylvania were characteristically dry, questions about herd count, tips for working the swarm at honey harvest; he hardly mentioned his own ranch, which to his son would not have seemed a ranch at all.<br><br>But by the early 1960s the demand for Westerns began to wane and George Spahn blamed, among others, Alfred Hitchcock. He increasingly ended his notes about farm business with aggravated rants about &#x201c;cut-&#x2019;em-ups,&#x201d; and&#x201c; sex-crazed&#x201d; moviegoers&#x2019; ?xation on horror ?lms, probably meaning Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Psycho</i>, the second-highest-grossing ?lm of 1960, after <i>Swiss Family Robinson</i>. On the ?rst day of February 1966, George Spahn ?led for bankruptcy. By then, unbeknownst to George, his wife&#x2019;s kidneys were marbled with tumors. Six weeks later, at UCLA Medical Center, Helen died from renal failure on the same ?oor where my father would die thirty-four years later. The coroner&#x2019;s report noted that her tumors were visible, and in the glaring light of the microscope seemed &#x201c;like hundreds of hairlike silver ribbons.&#x201d;<br><br>After Helen&#x2019;s death, George neglected the few already tenuous ties he had at the big studios. He wrote Henry often, spoke of the ranch deteriorating, of weeds pushing up through the soil in the corrals.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired,&#x201d; he wrote to his son on July 23, 1966. &#x201c;Let most everyone [three part-time ranch hands] go. It is hot here. So hot I have to wait for dusk to feed the horses. They get impatient down in the stalls and kick the empty troughs over. Boy, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe the noise of their hoofs against the metal . . .&#x201d;<br><br>In the end it was the horses, thirsty or not, that kept Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch a?oat. Spahn rented the horses to tourists for self-guided rides through the hills. Occasionally, a few of George&#x2019;s old studio friends would throw business his way, sending for six or eight paints when a scene couldn&#x2019;t have needed more than two. And so the horses became George&#x2019;s main source of income, meager as it was. The Los Angeles County tax records show Spahn&#x2019;s annual income in 1967 to be $13,120, less than a quarter of what it was in 1956.<br><br>In previous letters, George rarely wrote of Helen. When he did his lines were terse, referring to her only along with other ranch business: &#x201c;Storm coming in. Your mother&#x2019;s knuckles would have swelled. Lord knows we need the rain.&#x201d;<br><br>That year, George continued to write even as his eyesight failed, his lines sometimes piling atop one another. He began to write of Helen more frequently, sometimes devoting an entire page to her blackberry cobbler or the fragrance of her bath talcum. These are the only letters in which George, otherwise a deliberate and correct writer, slips into the present tense.<br><br>In September, George reported discovering a tiny bleached skull in the hills above his cabin. &#x201c;Bottles,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;picked clean by coyotes.&#x201d;<br><br>Or here. Begin here: When a group of about ten young people&#x2014;most of them teenagers, one of them my father&#x2014;arrived at the ranch in January of 1968, having hitchhiked from San Francisco, George was nearly blind. Surely he smelled them, though, as they approached his porch&#x2014;sweat, gasoline, the thick semisweet guff of marijuana. The group offered to help George with chores and maintenance in exchange for permission to camp out in the empty facaded set buildings. Though he&#x2019;d broken down and hired a hand a couple weeks earlier&#x2014;a nice kid, a bit macho, went by &#x201c;Shorty,&#x201d; wanted to be, what else?, an actor&#x2014;George agreed, perhaps because he wouldn&#x2019;t have to pay them. Or perhaps because the group&#x2019;s leader&#x2014;a man named Charlie&#x2014;offered to leave a young girl or two with George twenty-four-seven, to cook his meals, tidy the house, keep up with the laundry, and bed him whenever he wanted.<br><br>My father didn&#x2019;t kill anyone. And he&#x2019;s not a hero. It isn&#x2019;t that kind of story.<br><br>Nearly everyone who spent time at Spahn&#x2019;s that summer wrote a book after it was over, Bugliosi&#x2019;s only the most lucrative. We know, from the books of those who noticed, that a baby was born at Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch, likely April ninth, though accounts vary. In her version, Olivia Hall, who&#x2019;d been a senior at Paci?c Palisades High School and an occasional participant in group sex at the ranch, wrote of the birth: &#x201c;The mother, splayed out on the wood ?oor of the jail, struggled in labor for nearly fourteen hours, through the night and into the early morning, then gave up.&#x201d; In <i>The Manson Murders: One Woman&#x2019;s Escape</i>, Carla Shapiro, now a mother of four boys, says the struggling girl &#x201c;let her head roll back onto a sleeping bag and would not push. Then Manson took over.&#x201d; My father&#x2019;s book reads, &#x201c;Charlie held a cigarette lighter under a razor blade until the blade was hot and sliced the girl from vagina to anus. &#x201d;The baby girl slipped out, wailing, into Charlie&#x2019;s arms. My father: &#x201c;The place was a mess. Blood and clothes everywhere. I don&#x2019;t know where he found the razor blade.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie had a rule against couples. The group had nightly orgies at the ranch and before it in Topanga, Santa Barbara, Big Sur, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Oakland, San Francisco, the list goes on. You know this part, I&#x2019;m sure. The drugs, the sex. People came and went. Tracing the child&#x2019;s paternity was impossible, even if the group had been interested in that sort of thing. &#x201c;There was a birth, I know that,&#x201d; Tex Watson wrote to me from prison. &#x201c;Hell, might&#x2019;ve been mine. But we were all pretty gone, you know?&#x201d;<br><br>Of the mother, the accounts mention only how young she was. No name, no explanation of how she came to the ranch. One calls her &#x201c;dew-faced.&#x201d; In his account my father admits to having sex with her on several occasions. He says, &#x201c;She was a good kid.&#x201d;<br><br>After police raided Spahn&#x2019;s on August sixteenth, California Child Protective Services placed the baby with foster parents, Al and Vaye Orlando of Orlando&#x2019;s Furniture Warehouse in Thousand Oaks. Vaye constantly fussed over the baby, worried at her calmness, what she called &#x201c;a blankness in her face.&#x201d; During the child&#x2019;s ?rst ?ve years, Vaye had her examined for autism seven times, never trusting the results. She even hired a special nanny to play games with the child, encourage her cognitive development. Al thought this a waste of money.<br><br>Now the baby is a grown woman, forty. She is slender but not slight, and moves like liquid does. She has dark hair and the small brown eyes of a deer mouse. Not the eyes of those teenage girls my father met at Pali, the ones he invited to Spahn&#x2019;s and introduced to Charlie, the ones, later, with crosses cut into their foreheads, arms linked, singing down hallways, smiling into the camera in archived footage. I&#x2019;ve looked. These are my father&#x2019;s brown eyes.

We think of mindfulness and meditation, immersion in a state of being where meaning is found through simplicity. Zen lore has been absorbed by Western practitioners and pop culture alike, yet there is a specific area of this ancient tradition that hasn&#x2019;t been fully explored in the West. Now, in <i>The</i> <i>Zen of Creativity,</i> American Zen master John Daido Loori presents a book that taps the principles of the Zen arts and aesthetic as a means to unlock creativity and find freedom in the various dimensions of our existence. Loori dissolves the barriers between art and spirituality, opening up the possibility of meeting life with spontaneity, grace, and peace.<br><br>Zen Buddhism is steeped in the arts. In spiritual ways, calligraphy, poetry, painting, the tea ceremony, and flower arranging can point us toward our essential, boundless nature. Brilliantly interpreting the teachings of the artless arts, Loori illuminates various elements that awaken our creativity, among them <i>still point</i>, the center of each moment that focuses on the tranquility within; <i>simplicity</i>, in which the creative process is uncluttered and unlimited, like a cloudless sky; <i>spontaneity</i>, a way to navigate through life without preconceptions, with a freshness in which everything becomes new;<i> mystery, </i>a sense of trust in the unknown;<i> creative feedback,</i> the systematic use of an audience to receive noncritical input about our art;<i> art koans,</i> exercises based on paradoxical questions that can be resolved only through artistic expression. Loori shows how these elements interpenetrate and function not only in art, but in all our endeavors.<br><br>Beautifully illustrated and punctuated with poems and reflections from Loori&#x2019;s own spiritual journey, <i>The</i> <i>Zen of Creativity</i> presents a multilayered, bottomless source of insight into our creativity. Appealing equally to spiritual seekers, artists, and veteran Buddhist practitioners, this book is perfect for those wishing to discover new means of self-awareness and expression&#x2014;and to restore equanimity and freedom amid the vicissitudes of our lives.</p><p>John Daido Loori is one of the most well-known and respected Zen teachers in the United States. He is a successor of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and has received transmission in both Soto and Rinzai lineages of Zen. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Mountain Record of Zen Talks, Making Love with Light,</i> and <i>Riding the Ox Home: Stages on the Path of Enlightenment.</i>Chapter 1<br><br>Melting Snow<br><br>All the way to heaven<br><br>is heaven itself.<br><br>In the fall of 1980, after I completed Zen training in Los Angeles with my teacher, Maezumi Roshi, I came to the East Coast with the intention of establishing a Zen arts center-a place where Zen training would be used as the vehicle for studying, enhancing, and cultivating a creative life.<br><br>The Zen Arts Center opened in Mount Tremper in October of 1980. Its main thrust was the practice of art within a Zen context.<br><br>Art had been a passion of mine since I was young, but its deep connection to my spiritual journey didn't become obvious until much later. I started photographing when I was ten, and by the time I'd reached my mid thirties photography had become an important part of my life. While working as a research scientist, I began teaching photography part-time at a local college. Spirituality was not in the picture-at least not overtly. The first time these two areas overlapped was in the late 1960s when I traveled to Boston from New York to see a photography exhibit titled "The Sound of One Hand," by Minor White.<br><br>I didn't yet have any sense that art might be a doorway to serious and transformative spiritual practice, but something more than good technique drew me to Minor's work. Minor was a "straight photographer": he didn't manipulate his prints during the developing process, yet his images transcended their subject. Looking at his photographs, I felt myself being pulled into another realm of consciousness. Minor's work pointed to a dynamic way of seeing, a new way of perceiving.<br><br>My life has been the poem I would have writ,<br><br>But I could not both live and utter it.<br><br>henry david thoreau<br><br>One day in 1971 I received a letter from Aperture magazine announcing a workshop that Minor was giving at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. I took one look at the price and threw the letter in the garbage. A friend saw me, and she picked it up.<br><br>"Isn't this the man you're always talking about?" she asked. I nodded. "Then why are you throwing the letter away?"<br><br>"I don't have the money to pay for it."<br><br>"Send it in, John," she said. "Something will come up."<br><br>And, miraculously, something did. A month later a tax refund that I had completely forgotten about arrived in the mail. I sent in my portfolio, along with my date and place of birth so an astrologer could determine whether this was an auspicious time for me to do the retreat. With the acceptance letter I got the workshop's reading list. It consisted of three books: Carlos Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Eugen Herrigel's Zen and the Art of Archery, and Richard Boleslavsky's Acting: The First Six Lessons. Nothing on photography. What did my astrological chart or these books have to do with photography? At the time I was making my living as a physical chemist, and my rational, highly critical mind did not take well to these requests. But I really wanted to study with Minor, so I went along with what he asked.<br><br>When I arrived at the Hotchkiss School I saw that there were sixty participants, ranging in age from eighteen to seventy. Minor greeted us as we arrived. He was a striking figure, well over six feet tall, with a flowing mane of white hair. He moved quietly, gracefully, and when he entered a space, he filled it completely.<br><br>This oceanic feeling of wonder is the<br><br>common source of religious mysticism, of<br><br>pure science and art for art's sake.<br><br>arthur koestler<br><br>The first full day of the workshop began at four in the morning. The sound of a bass drum moving down the hallway arrived without warning. It was pitch black outside. How are we going to photograph in the dark? I wondered. Drowsily, I dressed and filed outside with the others. We gathered on a grassy field and a modern dancer began to lead us through a series of exercises. Everyone was participating, including Minor.<br><br>I turned to the man next to me. "Why are we doing this? What does this have to do with photography?"<br><br>"Ssshhhhh. Just do it," he said.<br><br>I had paid hundreds of dollars to study photography with Minor, and I wasn't about to spend the week undulating in the dark! Furious, I stormed away.<br><br>Back in my room, I started to pack my things. Dawn was breaking, and the line of dancers caught my eye as I passed the window. They were spread across the length of the field. I took the camera, screwed on a telephoto lens, and began to shoot, feeling very pleased with myself. They can do whatever they want. I'm going to photograph. That thought perfectly summarized where I was at that time in my life: standing apart, looking at the world through a lens, like a voyeur.<br><br>After the morning session, a group of students led by the dance instructor came to my room to convince me to stay. "You're not giving it a chance," they said. "You're copping out." I could have defended myself, but I was moved by the fact that they even cared whether I stayed or left. And deep down I knew that I couldn't just walk away. I wanted so badly to learn to see the way Minor did, to photograph my subjects in a way that didn't render them lifeless and two-dimensional.<br><br>As the days unfolded I woke up before dawn, meditated, and danced with everyone else. We attended lectures and did various exercises. We didn't even touch our cameras for the first day or two. Then Minor began to challenge us with different questions that dealt with our way of seeing ourselves and the universe, questions that needed to be resolved visually.<br><br>One of these assignments was a turning point for me. On day four of the workshop, Minor told us to photograph our essence. "Don't photograph your personality," he explained. "Try to go deep into the core of your being. Photograph who you really are."<br><br>Who I really am? I was absorbed in this question as I walked outside and sat in the field underneath a sprawling oak. I suddenly started sobbing. I couldn't stop, and I had no idea why. Somehow, that seemed terribly funny, and I began to laugh. I kept laughing until I was exhausted. Who am I? That question repeated itself over and over in my mind.<br><br>Back in my room, I packed my 4 � 5 camera and a small backpack, prepared to stay out overnight in order to resolve this question. I set off for the nearby forest and began wandering. Minor's instructions echoed in my mind: Venture into the landscape without expectations. Let your subject find you. When you approach it, you will feel resonance, a sense of recognition. If, when you move away, the resonance fades, or if it gets stronger as you approach, you'll know you have found your subject. Sit with your subject and wait for your presence to be acknowledged. Don't try to make a photograph, but let your intuition indicate the right moment to release the shutter. If, after you've made an exposure, you feel a sense of completion, bow and let go of the subject and your connection to it. Otherwise, continue photographing until you feel the process is complete.<br><br>The state of mind of the photographer while<br><br>creating is a blank. . . . [but] It is a very active state of mind really, a very receptive state of mind, ready<br><br>at an instant to grasp an image, yet with no image pre-formed in it at any time.<br><br>minor white<br><br>Minor's language was foreign to me. I had no idea what this resonance was supposed to feel like, or how I would recognize when my subject acknowledged me. I didn't know if I could feel a sense of completion, or what I was supposed to do to "let go." Yet, surprisingly, I was willing to trust Minor, and the process. Somehow, I intuited that I could do what he had asked. More importantly, I knew that I had to do it in order to answer the question.<br><br>Around noon I came to a beautiful gully and decided to rest. I built a small fire, leaned against a rock, and was eating my lunch when I sensed someone's presence nearby. I looked up and saw the elegant figure of a man standing at the top of the ridge, the sun glowing behind him. He climbed down the rocks toward me, and I recognized John, a modern dancer and one of Minor's senior students. I had been impressed with John since the beginning of the retreat. He would often photograph as he danced, leaping and turning in the air with a Polaroid camera in his hand. Like Minor's work, John's photos made me realize that there were other ways to<br><br>photograph, other ways to see that were not so rational or linear.<br><br>I invited John to join me and offered him a cup of tea. As soon as he sat down, I started jabbering about anything and everything. In the middle of my rant he abruptly whispered, "Listen! Listen!" In the silence I heard a faint tinkling. Intrigued, I picked up my camera and headed off toward the sound, leaving John behind. I soon found myself in thick, dark woods. A brook trickled through the mossy rocks. Light streamed through the trees; bright reflections danced on the water in the surrounding darkness. Enchanted by the scene, I stayed by the brook for an hour or more, completing several photographs in a slow, methodical, almost meditative way.<br><br>When I returned to the gully John was gone, and there was no sign of him ever having been there. The cup of tea I had offered him was still in my knapsack, completely clean. There were no crumbs on the ground, no traces of him anywhere. It was as if our meeting had never happened-in fact, I wasn't sure that it had.<br><br>I packed up and continued my wandering. As the sun passed the zenith and began its descent across the sky, the light that filtered through the canopy of trees became softer and warmer. None of the photographs I had taken so far seemed to touch the essence toward which Minor had pointed me.<br><br>Again, I heard Minor's voice in my head. Photograph who you really are. I was looking at the ground, navigating over big roots with the heavy camera on my shoulder. I looked up and saw a tree standing a few feet away and off to my right which riveted my attention. It was an ancient hardwood with a gnarled trunk. Something about the way the light spilled over it drew me nearer. I approached it, bowed, set up my camera, and sat down on the ground next to the tripod, waiting for my presence to be acknowledged. I sat as still and quietly as I could, with my hand on the shutter release. Briefly, I wondered how I was supposed to know when to make the exposure. That's the last thing I remember.<br><br>Hours later, I realized I was shivering. The sun had set behind the mountains and the afternoon had turned cold. Somehow, time had vanished for me. I slowly rose, aware that something deep inside me had shifted. The questions I had been struggling with during the workshop-all of my life, for that matter-had melted away. I felt buoyant and joyful. The world was right; I was right. I didn't even know whether I had taken a photograph of the old tree, but at that point it didn't really matter.<br><br>I headed back to the school, for an appointment I had with Minor to discuss my work. He was sitting on the porch outside his room, waiting for me. Settling next to him, the list of questions I had prepared earlier in the week no longer seemed relevant.<br><br>He looked at me and said, "You had a good day, didn't you?" I smiled, and he smiled, too.<br><br>"What would you like to talk about?" he asked.<br><br>"Honestly," I said, "I don't have anything to say."<br><br>"Good," he replied. "Then let's just sit here together."<br><br>The days that followed deepened my appreciation for Minor and his teachings. Something had opened in me, and the techniques and activities of the workshop started to make sense. Minor was guiding us to go beyond simply seeing images. He was inviting us to feel, smell, and taste them. He was teaching us how to be photography.<br><br>As I was leaving, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for Minor's teaching that I didn't know how to requite. When I said this to Minor, he simply said, "You're a teacher, right?" I nodded. "Well, then teach."<br><br>For a while this is what I did. I was very productive at first. I was seeing and photographing in a new way, and the workshops I taught around the country reflected a deeper understanding of myself as a photographer. But as the months passed, this new way of seeing and the feeling of peace that accompanied it receded, and my feelings of wholeness and well-being began to fade.<br><br>I tried to regain my balance by re-creating everything we had done during Minor's workshop. I read books on religion, spirituality, and philosophy. I stood on my head, ate vegetarian food, and meditated. I listened to the music that Minor had played for us. I kept coming back to the questions: What had allowed the world to disappear so completely when I sat in front of the tree? Why did everything feel so right after that? Why did I feel at peace? And how did everything become cloudy again?<br><br>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead<br><br>where there is no path and leave a trail.<br><br>ralph waldo emerson<br><br>I then set out on a crooked path to find the answers to these questions, not knowing that this path would lead me to the mystical tradition of Zen and a new way of understanding art. But the first step on this path was to see if Minor could help me to make sense of what I was going through, so that's where I started. Feeling a little nervous, I gave him a call. Without hesitation, without even asking me for a reason or even pausing to think it over, Minor responded. "Come," he said generously, "we can have dinner and talk."<br><br>Minor's large two-story house in Cambridge was meticulously clean and sparsely furnished. It was sectioned into dormitories and studios for Minor's apprentices, including a state-of-the-art darkroom facility equipped for archival printing and framing. Minor divided his time between teaching photography at MIT and maintaining this apprenticeship program, reminiscent of the traditional way in which artists and artisans learned art from a master. The training was rigorous and experiential, an extension of what I had encountered at the workshop.</p><h2>Death in a Lonely Land: More Hunting, Fishing, and Shooting on Five Continents</h2><p><p><b>From the author of <i>Last Horizons</i>, Peter Hathaway Capstick now presents <i>Death in a Lonely Land</i>, a second volume of his hunting, fishing, and shooting adventures on five continents&#x2015;stories collected from such magazines as <i>Outdoor Life</i>, NRA&#x2019;s <i>American Hunter</i>, <i>Guns &amp; Ammo</i>, and <i>Petersen&#x2019;s Hunting</i>. </b></p><p>The stockbroker-turned-outdoorsman recalls his days as an African pro hunter in &#x201c;The Killer Baboons of Vlackfontein.&#x201d; &#x201c;Four Fangs in a Treetop&#x201d; records a foray into British Honduras for the jaguar, &#x201c;a gold-dappled teardrop of motion.&#x201d; Capstick narrowly escapes the Yellow Beard, Central America&#x2019;s deadly tree-climbing snake, and cows &#x201c;The Black Death&#x201d; (Cape buffalo) in the kind of article that makes this author &#x201c;the guru of American hunting fans&#x201d; (<i>New York Newsday</i>).

GUNS &amp; AMMO--MARCH 1980 AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION <i>It is my personal belief that if a man forsakes the great days and "toys" that brought him a wonderful childhood, he would be foolish to start taking himself seriously and forget those same things that brought him the joy of youth as he grows a bit longer in the fangs. Of course, we have to contend with the Bible, which suggests that a man must do away with childish things, but I really don't think BB guns were part of the message. The joy of shooting and teaching the shooting arts must be eternal. After all, who taught David to use his sling?</i> <i>I'll not bother to give the source of the idea that the only difference between men and boys is the cost of their toys. But if you show me a man who takes himself seriously, you will usually find that he's missing a great deal of his own heritage.</i> <i>So many times now, I have said that shooting is a state of mind, whether with a $50,000 Holland &amp; Holland Royal grade double rifle or the Daisy or the Crosman. To sneer and be "above" such juvenile pleasures comes right off the limit of your moral credit card. What, after all, is the shooting life all about? I believe it is to have fun. So, go on. Take a couple of shots. I'll bet you remember things gladly that were long forgotten ... .</i> It was just the other day, a bright, clear Southwest Florida morning replete with dueling mockingbirds, soft, rising sea breezes and loafing, poison-green chameleons in the hybiscus when my wife wearily asked me what I wanted to be when--and if--I grew up. Possibly the fact that I had just spilled half a pack of BBs with improved cylinder distribution over the kitchen vinyl had something to do with her query, but then you never really know about women's motives. She gave me one of those sideways looks (probably searching for an artery near the surface) and held the dustpan, all the while observing that she has three children: her son, daughter, and me. I wasn't really listening, struck by the curious fact that neither Daisy Super Accurate Precision Ground Bullseye BBs nor Crosman Perfectly Round Micrometer Tested Super BBs tend to make the apparently simple transition between broom and dustpan edge without slickly rolling at right angles to pour back under the dishwasher. The <i>other</i> dishwasher, that is. I am applying the empirical processes to this phenomenon, possibly a matter of sectional density or, conceivably, an aberrant ballistic coefficient. Then, it could be that my broom handle needs one-quarter inch more drop at the heel or that the dustpan has a poor wood-to-metal fit and should be glass-bedded. Despite being six foot eight and having a sense of humor like Irving R. Levine, my wife is really a good woman at heart. She never beats me where it shows in public, sees to my nourishment with astounding zeal, and has seen to it that I am never guilty of Ring Around the Collar. Yet she is a woman and, by genetic selection and sexual definition, suspicious as a low-water brown trout anytime she catches me edging out the back door with a BB gun, muttering and woe-is-me-ing under my breath that I am not really going out to have a crashing good time playing Rover Boys but am, in fact, a serious firearms journalist on a bona fide research project. I flash my press card at her and stand firm. At least reasonably firm. I am working. Employed. Assaying the dizzy heights of semi-solvency.I don't wander around all morning plinking at things and shooting up the new phone book for penetration tests because I <i>like</i> it. God forbid! It's dirty, dangerous work. I would infinitely prefer cleaning out the garage or playing human fly washing the upstairs windows for the party next Friday. But, A Man Sees What Must Be Done and Does It. Like all gun writers, I have a very deep-seated sense of professional responsibility. I am also completely bananas over BB guns of any description, the affliction being known, dependent upon your choice of clinical nomenclature, as either the Red Ryder Syndrome or Crosman's Disease. Like most of you Faithful, my first frontal assault on the world of shooting was with a Daisy. If I'd gotten a nickel an hour for the time spent stalking mastodons and king cobras down by the frog pond and wandering the nomadic, after-school woods aglow with the sense of satisfaction that only the dry rattle of a full BB reservoir can bring, I'd likely now be living off a stable of municipal bonds on my private Greek island. There have been a lot of vodka martinis over my inlays since that first lever-action Daisy, yet I can still remember every nick in its authentic hardwood stock, including the magnificent hand work I did engraving my initials in bas-relief with a Christmas-new X-acto woodcarving knife kit. When I was finished, halfway through the crossbar on the H, they were able to wire up the tendon of my left thumb quite neatly, although it played hell for years with my flipper reflex on the pinball machines. That rifle, after spitting what must have been a half-ton of BBs, somehow got laid aside and is undoubtedly resting, fossil-like, somewhere in the primeval plasto-metallic sludge spawned by the debris of the culture of Montville, New Jersey. Helluva shame. If you can find it, I'll trade you even for a new Holland &amp; Holland Royal. When I was nine, I graduated to the Daisy pump gun, a real magnum after the old lever action. But I never liked it that much because all the trajectories and Kentucky windage wired into my circuits were negated by its greater power. It was also trickier to load and didn't have the vast magazine capacity of the lever gun. I went back to the saddle gun with its loop of gen-u-wine rawhide knotted about the ring on the side of thereceiver, the purpose of which accoutrement I never did fathom, except that Red Ryder and Little Beaver both thought highly of it. Later, about the time I was paroled from reform school for conspiring to overthrow the School Board by force, I got one of the fancy hammer versions, the Buffalo Bill Scout. Zowie! I still shoot it in fits of beloved melancholy. Actually, the use of a BB gun on a regular basis is one of the best possible ways to keep sharp the hand-eye coordination necessary when hunting with either a rifle or a shotgun. Just as snow skiing transfers to water skiing, so does the BB gun transfer many talents to firearms use. Want to teach your son or daughter the elements of lead for wing shooting? Have them spend a few hours popping away at dragonflies or firing at chips of wood in a fast-flowing stream. Even the U.S. Army has found the little guns a valuable training aid for the instinctual act of combat firing, teaching recruits to hit thrown lead washers and smaller items in the air with BB guns that have had the front and rear sights removed. BB guns have come a long way, baby, since the early push-pull, click-click models of my wasted youth, let alone since their introduction by Daisy back in the 1880s. Recently, I got stuck into the subject again after combing through the sleek new offerings in the rear sections of the <i>Guns &amp; Ammo Annual,</i> and decided to pick an example of the newer developments in the field for evaluation. Completely disregarding the ultra-sophisticated grouping of match and high-performance pellet guns, I settled almost arbitrarily on a new air gun by Crosman, the multi-stroke Model 760XL. Oops! I do beg your collective pardon, Messrs. Crosman; I meant the Model 760XL Deluxe Powermaster with "Deluxe Styling!" and even "Deluxe Features," no less. Wow! I'll give you this, boys: if you're used to a double beef Whopper, hold the onions, extra cheese, the creature that lay before me was a double helping of larks' tongues on Beluga caviar with Tasmanian leatherwood honey sauce. If <i>that</i> was what BB guns have come to, then I may have been naive about the relationship between Red Ryder and Li'l Beaver. If I'd had that gun when I was fourteen, I would have been the first kid on the block to rule the earth. No two ways about it, the 760 is a mean, sexy-looking machine that is really far more than a BB gun in the sense I normally think of one. First off, it's a hybrid between a repeating BB rifle (Imagine! Rifling! Ten lands!) and a single-shot pellet rifle offering a wide choice of power selections, depending upon how many times you pump it, between a minimum of two strokes and a maximum of ten. Why not eleven, or for those of you who strike without closing cover, even twelve? Well, I've put it off long enough. If you're a gun writer, you just have to take the terrible dangers inherent in the profession as part of the price of earning the tremendous fees we command for these high-risk articles. I picked up the gun in my bare hands and hefted it. (Incidentally, there is a common misconception among anti-gun folk that guns are "slimy." This is not true. They are simply smooth and cool to the touch.) Having determined from the owner's manual precisely which was the "barrel" and which the "stock," I located the Reservoir Loading Port, which, for the sake of keeping this whole thing professional, I shall call the RLP. Having cleverly decided to try the repeating BB action first, I cracked the milk carton of 1,500 Crosman Super BB Perfectly Round Micrometer Tested ammo (SBBPRMT). I took their word for it that it was not just 1,499. Careful not to point the muzzle at anybody I did not want to shoot, I put the gun on "SAFE" and attempted to pour 180 SBBPRMTs through the <i></i>-inch RLP. After several minutes and the application of some language our younger readers might think unsporting, I got enough in to at least cause some trouble. Ah, but if you think that's all there is to foddering the 760XL, you didn't read the manual.

It was written in 1873, in the aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash between Bakunin and Karl Marx in the first International. Bakunin assesses the strength of a European state system dominated by Bismarck. Then, in the most remarkable part of the book, he assails the Marxist alternative, predicting that a &#34;dictatorship of the proletariat&#34; will in fact be a dictatorship over the proletariat, and will produce a new class of socialist rulers. Instead, he outlines his vision of an anarchist society and identifies the social forces he believes will achieve an ananarchist revolution. Statism and Anarchy had an immediate influence on the &#34;to the people&#34; movement of Russian populism, and Bakunin&#39;s ideas inspired other anarchist movements. This is the only complete and reliable rendition of Statism and Anarchy in English, and in a lucid introduction Marshall Shatz locates Bakunin in his immediate historical and intellectual context, and assesses the impact of his ideas on the wider development of European radical thought. A guide to further reading and a chronology of events are appended as aids to students encountering Bakunin&#39;s thought for the first time.</p><p>Written in the 1873 aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash with Karl Marx in the first International, the great Russian anarchist&#39;s last work had an immediate influence on the &#34;to the people&#34; movement of Russian populism.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>The Secret River</h2><p>In 1806 William Thornhill, an illiterate English bargeman and a man of quick temper but deep compassion, steals a load of wood and, as a part of his lenient sentence, is deported, along with his beloved wife, Sal, to the New South Wales colony in what would become Australia. <i>The Secret River</i> is the tale of William and Sal&#x2019;s deep love for their small, exotic corner of the new world, and William&#x2019;s gradual realization that if he wants to make a home for his family, he must forcibly take the land from the people who came before him. Acclaimed around the world, <i>The Secret River</i> is a magnificent, transporting work of historical fiction.<br></p><p>Kate Grenville is one of Australia&#39;s best-loved authors. Her works of fiction have won numerous awards both in Australia and internationally. The Idea of Perfection won the 2001 Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction and became a long-running bestseller. In 2006 The Secret River won the Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prize and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Searching For The Secret River, the story behind this novel, is also available from Canongate, alongside her first novel, Lilian&#39;s Story, and The Lieutenant. Kate Grenville lives in Sydney.For contemporary Australians, a genealogical search might well lead back to the British prisoners, circa 1800, who were exiled to the no-man's-land of New South Wales. Orange Prize winner Grenville found out little about her own family, but the heritage she creates in this historical novel is both personal and believable. Audie Award winner Simon Vance narrates with only the slightest British accent. The moment he steps into dialogue, however, the characters come alive and distinct. These men were not murderers or hardened criminals, and Vance's ability to convey sensitivity behind the gruff exterior of their voices (or, in the case of a few, the lack of sensitivity) reaches refreshingly beyond the words on the printed page.

But it also includes our positive, untapped potential&#x2014;qualities we may admire in others but disavow in ourselves. Befriending the shadow makes fear an ally and enables us to live more authentically. It also automatically improves our interpersonal relationships, because we are freed from the need to project our own negativity onto others, and we become more acutely aware when theirs is projected onto us. David Richo looks for where the shadow manifests in personal life, family interaction, religion, relationship, and the world around is. He shows how to use the gentle practice of mindfulness to work with our shadow side, and he provides numerous exercises for going deeper. He is remarkably skillful at making the shadow concept not only easy to understand, but supremely practical for enhancing the quality of our lives.</p><p>"Our scared and arrogant ego has an enormous capacity not to know itself," says Esalen Institute psychotherapist David Richo. The shadow self, the dark side of the personality, is hidden in the psyche. Others often see it, but we do not. As Jung says, "The shadow is the negative side of the personality, the sum of all those unpleasant qualities we like to hide, together with the insufficiently developed functions and the contents of the personal unconscious....[The shadow] also displays a number of good qualities such as normal instincts, appropriate reactions, realistic insights, creative impulses, etc." Richo has written an enormously useful book in which he introduces the reader to the conscious persona and the subconscious shadow. Unlike other practitioners, he includes conscious but negatively perceived traits in his definition of the dark side, plus undiscovered or unused positive traits. By helping the reader to befriend the shadow self instead of projecting it onto others in dysfunctional or destructive ways, the author performs a profound service, freeing emotional and creative resources through which we can manifest brighter, healthier lives. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>David Richo, PhD, is a therapist and author who leads popular workshops on personal and spiritual growth.

It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.</p><p>The Battle of Iwo Jima, fought in the winter of 1945 on a rocky island south of Japan, brought a ferocious slice of hell to earth: in a month's time, more than 22,000 Japanese soldiers would die defending a patch of ground a third the size of Manhattan, while nearly 26,000 Americans fell taking it from them. The battle was a turning point in the war in the Pacific, and it produced one of World War II's enduring images: a photograph of six soldiers raising an American flag on the flank of Mount Suribachi, the island's commanding high point.<p> One of those young Americans was John Bradley, a Navy corpsman who a few days before had braved enemy mortar and machine-gun fire to administer first aid to a wounded Marine and then drag him to safety. For this act of heroism Bradley would receive the Navy Cross, an award second only to the Medal of Honor.</p><p> Bradley, who died in 1994, never mentioned his feat to his family. Only after his death did Bradley's son James begin to piece together the facts of his father's heroism, which was but one of countless acts of sacrifice made by the young men who fought at Iwo Jima. <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i> recounts the sometimes tragic life stories of the six men who raised the flag that February day--one an Arizona Indian who would die following an alcohol-soaked brawl, another a Kentucky hillbilly, still another a Pennsylvania steel-mill worker--and who became reluctant heroes in the bargain. A strongly felt and well-written entry in a spate of recent books on World War II, <i>Flags</i> gives a you-are-there depiction of that conflict's horrible arenas--and a moving homage to the men whom fate brought there. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima.

In it you will meet the woman known to tens of millions as Annie Hall, but you will also meet, and fall in love with, her mother, the loving, complicated, always-thinking Dorothy Hall. To write about herself, Diane realized she had to write about her mother, too, and how their bond came to define both their lives. In a remarkable act of creation, Diane not only reveals herself to us, she also lets us meet in intimate detail her mother. Over the course of her life, Dorothy kept eighty-five journals&#x2014;literally thousands of pages&#x2014;in which she wrote about her marriage, her children, and, most probingly, herself. Dorothy also recorded memorable stories about Diane&#x2019;s grandparents. Diane has sorted through these pages to paint an unflinching portrait of her mother&#x2014;a woman restless with intellectual and creative energy, struggling to find an outlet for her talents&#x2014;as well as her entire family, recounting a story that spans four generations and nearly a hundred years. <br> &nbsp;<br> More than the autobiography of a legendary actress, <i>Then Again</i> is a book about a very American family with very American dreams.

Woven throughout the book are excerpts from the dozens of journals Keaton's mother, Dorothy Hall, kept over the years. (She died in 2008.) If you&#x2019;re a Diane Keaton fan, you&#x2019;ll adore her even more after reading this memoir.

Simon is an ordinary kitchen helper who is taken under the tutelage of the magician Morgenes. When King John Presbyter dies and his son Elias ascends the throne, the way opens for a long-dormant evil to enter the realm. Elias, a pawn of the black magician Pyrates, moves to eliminate his brother Josua, and the brother-against-brother, good-versus-evil clash begins. Simon is thrown in with Josua and muddles through adventure and peril, maturing into a hero by book's end. Williams weaves all of the classic ingredients of fantasy into his tale--trolls, giants, elf-like sithi, and dragons. Simon must travel from drought-stricken lands to ice-bound peaks as he follows his far-seeing dreams. The land of Osten Ard is well created, and readers quickly become immersed in the story.

Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Expatriates: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse</h2><p><b>In the latest survivalist thriller from founder of survivalblog.com and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author James Wesley, Rawles, two expat families struggle for their very survival in the midst of a global economic collapse.</b><br><br>When the United States suffers a major socioeconomic collapse, a power vacuum sweeps the globe.

There were three of them, all men in their early twenties wearing hoodie sweatshirts. As they ran up to the counter, two of them pulled out handguns. Janelle was petrified. In a flash, she realized that she was unarmed, and that her husband, Jacob&#x2014; who <i>was </i>armed&#x2014;was out of sight in the back of the store, running the panel saw. He was cutting up a piece of plywood for a customer. The noise of the saw would drown out her voice, even if she were to shout for help.</p><p>The shortest of the three men tossed a pillowcase to Janelle and ordered, &#x201c;Fill it! Dump the cash tray and the cash <i>under </i>the tray in, too.&#x201d; She quickly opened the cash register and complied. As she handed the sack back to the man, one of the others, with an acne-scarred complexion, hissed, &#x201c;You pick up the phone in less than five minutes and I&#x2019;ll come back here next week and empty this gun into you.&#x201d;</p><p>The three men fled just as Janelle heard the sound of the vertically mounted Skilsaw winding down. She ran toward her husband in a panicked dash. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve just been robbed,&#x201d; she shouted over the noise. Jake hesitated only for a moment before unholstering his SIG pistol. He started walking toward the front of the store, cautiously. Behind him, Janelle said, &#x201c;Three young black guys, all wearing hoodies. Two of them have guns.&#x201d; Jake glanced at the open cash register and the register&#x2019;s empty cash tray sitting at an odd angle.</p><p>They heard tires screeching outside the store. Jake picked up his pace and jogged to the hardware store&#x2019;s front entrance. As he ran out the door, he caught just a glimpse of an older Ford Taurus racing down the street. He stopped and lowered his pistol. Then he noticed that his hands were shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Call 911! Black Ford Taurus sedan. Tell &#x2019;em they&#x2019;re headed south on State Road 19!&#x201d; he shouted to Janelle. Then muttering to himself, he added, &#x201c;And they&#x2019;ll be lost in the traffic and down in Orlando before the cops even get out of the donut shop.&#x201d;</p><p>Their store had been burglarized the year before, so they&#x2019;d added bars to the windows and beefed up the back door. But they hadn&#x2019;t expected an armed robbery during the day. To Janelle, robberies had seemed like something that happened only to jewelry shops, liquor stores, and gas stations&#x2014;and then mainly in Jacksonville or Orlando.</p><p>The robbery made the Altmillers seriously reconsider security for their small hardware store. The store had been established by Jake&#x2019;s grandfather, who had bought the 2.5-acre lot for just twelve hundred dollars during World War II. Situated south of the Dora Canal, it had been in continuous operation since 1946. It was also the last family-owned, independent hardware store in Lake County. All of the others had long since been affiliated with chains like Ace or True Value, or run out of business by the big-box giants like Home Depot and Lowe&#x2019;s. And while they&#x2019;d suffered their share of shoplifting, this was the first time they&#x2019;d ever been robbed at gunpoint.</p><p>A few days after the robbery, the Altmillers added four miniature security cameras that recorded directly to their PC&#x2019;s hard drive. One of these cameras was deliberately set up at a low angle to avoid the classic &#x201c;view of the top of the perp&#x2019;s baseball cap.&#x201d; Another camera was aimed at the front entrance, and contrasting strips of colored tape were added at one-foot intervals running up both sides of the door frame. When seen in surveillance footage, these markings would allow them to approximate the height of a suspect after a robbery.</p><p>Most importantly, Janelle and Jake began to carry their pistols daily. They both took the three-day fighting pistol immersion course taught by Florida Firearms Training in Okeechobee. This was Janelle&#x2019;s first formal firearms instruction. For Jake, who had taken two previous classes by other instructors, the comprehensive course made him realize how much he still had to learn. They both made a point of doing monthly practice shooting sessions at the local range on Sunday afternoons when the store was closed.</p><p>Janelle stood just five feet two inches tall&#x2014;eight inches shorter than her husband. Her rounded hips and short trunk made most hip holsters uncomfortable for her. Drawing her pistol from a hip holster was ungainly because of the short distance between the top of the holster and her armpit. She tried several types of right-handed holsters before settling on a modified Kydex cross-draw holster made by Multi Holsters. She concealed it with the blue Altmiller&#x2019;s Hardware logo canvas vests that they wore to identify store employees. By wearing the vest unbuttoned, she could draw the pistol quickly if needed. On the few occasions when a customer caught a glimpse of the holstered pistol, it usually triggered compliments rather than ridicule. Florida, after all, had one million concealed carry pistol permits&#x2014;the most of any state. There was a reason it was nicknamed the Gunshine State.</p><br><br><p><b>Doubts </b></p><p>&#x201c;Ever since the religion of Islam appeared in the world, the espousers of it . . . have been as wolves and tigers to all other nations, rending and tearing all that fell into their merciless paws, and grinding them with their iron teeth; that numberless cities are raised from the foundation, and only their name remaining; that many countries, which were once as the garden of God, are now a desolate wilderness; and that so many once numerous and powerful nations are vanished from the earth!

He had just survived a big layoff. This had been the first time the company had let go more than just assemblers. Two friends from his department&#x2014;one from New Zealand and one from Singapore&#x2014;were the company&#x2019;s only foreign-born employees. Without warning, they had been told to pack up the personal contents of their cubicles and were escorted out the door. It soon became apparent that all of the others singled out in the layoff were non-Muslims, leaving the with a one hundred percent Muslim staff. The circumstances of the layoff troubled Wulandari.</p><p>The next day, word came of a lucrative new video camera assembly contract. <i>Why would the company need to lay off anyone when they&#x2019;ve just received a new contract? </i>Wulandari wondered. Everyone else seemed happy to still have their jobs, so they didn&#x2019;t ask many questions.</p><p>While reviewing the drawing specifications for the new assembly contract, Wulandari noticed that the drawings were incomplete. The diagrams showed only one half of a clamshell housing marked camera case, a battery, and a digital timer. The large round center section of the housing was a blank spot in the drawings, marked simply as camera position (tbd). The empty space also seemed unusually large for a digital camera, given their recent miniaturization. Even stranger, there were no molded projections in the plastic to hold a camera in place.</p><p>All of the parts for the assembly project came in from several other subcontractors: 252 unmarked gray plastic cases from an injection molding company in Tasikmalaya, boxes of aluminum screws from a fastener supply company in Banjarsari, 252 five-year-life 48-volt lithium manganese dioxide batteries sourced from China, bundles of green LEDs from a parts vendor in Jakarta Tangerang, and 252 generic programmable digital timers made by Omron.</p><p>The battery specification also struck Wulandari as unusual. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries would have been a better choice for a camera system. <i>Why would they specify a 48 volt disposable battery, and why did they need one with such a high voltage and amp hour rating? </i>He surmised that they wanted to emplace &#x201c;set and forget&#x201d; espionage cameras for several years, but the specifications still seemed incongruous.</p><p>When the 252 timers arrived, he grew even more suspicious. They were packed in cardboard boxes labeled omron automation&#x2014;a major electronics company in Jakarta Selatan&#x2014;but the timers themselves were completely unmarked. Every other electronics subassembly he&#x2019;d ever worked with had carried at least a maker&#x2019;s name and part number. The lack of any markings further piqued his curiosity.</p><p>The camera boxes had only a pair of 48-volt DC power input wires, a mini-USB controller port, two pairs of 20-centimeter-long 48-volt output wires, and another 40-centimeter pair of thinner leads in a contrasting color, with smaller connectors that were attached to the low-current, low-voltage green status light LEDs. These were left dangling for later assembly, which was not common practice.</p><p>Wulandari asked his supervisor why they were doing only part of the assembly, but the senior engineer offered no explanation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. We are just the subcontractor.&#x201d; And when Wulandari asked about the customer, his boss said, &#x201c;They tell me it is a secret project for the BIN. I think it must be some kind of spy camera.&#x201d; The Indonesian Badan Intelijen Negara&#x2014;the Indonesian equivalent of the CIA&#x2014;was notoriously secretive. Another employee, however, was told that it was a project for the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space or Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional (LAPAN). Wulandari didn&#x2019;t know who to believe.</p><p>Wulandari also raised concerns about the flimsy aluminum screws that were specified for mounting the camera&#x2019;s timer and battery, as they would be easily deformed when the cameras were eventually serviced. Once again, his concerns were brushed aside. &#x201c;I have no idea why aluminum. That is just what they ordered.&#x201d;</p><p>After all of the parts had arrived, the assembly of the cameras was completed in just one week and resulted in a very profitable contract for the company. The 252 camera housings&#x2014;with batteries and timers installed and LEDs attached&#x2014;were then packaged and sent by truck to another small company farther south in Banten Province, ostensibly for installation of the cameras.</p><p>The camera case contract was soon forgotten by most of the company&#x2019;s employees. But Wulandari&#x2019;s doubts about it persisted until almost three years later, when the camera cases made news headlines, erasing all doubt about their true purpose.</p><br><br><p><b>Life In Oz </b></p><p>&#x201c;A society that does not defend itself is doomed. A system that remains passive in the face of attack deserves to go under. Those unwilling to defend freedom will become unfree. To stand idly by is to commit suicide.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;The late Brian Crozier,<i> Strategy of Survival </i></p><p><i>Fifteen Miles Northeast of Bulman, Northern Territory,<br>Australia&#x2014;November, One Year Before the Crunch </i></p><p>It was late in the afternoon, and the three men were tired. They had already lowered ten of the high-explosive seismic charges down the previously drilled shot holes, and this would be the eleventh of the day. Sweat was dripping off the end of Chuck Nolan&#x2019;s nose. Randall &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d; Burroughs, one of Chuck&#x2019;s &#x201c;jug hustler&#x201d; assistants, lifted the thirty-four-pound yellow plastic tube of Geoprime dBX explosives to the mouth of the hole. The thousands of feet of cables and geophones, or jugs, laid out by the team over the rough, dry terrain would capture the reflected acoustic energy released from these explosive charges and provide an image of the underlying geologic strata.</p><p>Looking up from the reel of thin two-strand electrical wire that was resting in the payout stand, his other assistant, Bruce Drake, said, &#x201c;Hey, mate, you forgot the suspension cord.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Burroughs asked.</p><p>Just then, the tube slipped from Randall&#x2019;s sweaty fingers. The five-inch-diameter plastic canister briefly lodged at a slight angle in the top of the bore, but then straightened itself and continued its fall before Burroughs could grasp it again. The wire payout wheel spun rapidly with a loud whirring sound.</p><p>Chuck yelled, &#x201c;Run!&#x201d; at the top of his lungs.</p><p>Run they did, in three different directions. They were still sprinting and just ten yards from the bore when the explosives tube hit the bottom of the hole. The sharp jolt of bottoming in the bore set off the blasting caps. Instantly, the main charge detonated. An enormous cloud of red dust loomed up from the bore and from the soil near it. The ground lurched beneath their feet as dirt and rocks came raining down around them. Chuck felt at least two clods or small rocks hit his yellow plastic bump cap, and one glanced off his shoulder. Another hit the side of Chuck&#x2019;s Jeep.</p><p>After running a few more yards, Chuck stopped and looked back. As the cloud of red dust started to dissipate, he could see that his assistants were still in one piece and running. Even though his ears were ringing, Chuck started laughing uproariously, greatly relieved that they had escaped the blast unscathed.</p><p>Drake stopped and yelled at Burroughs. &#x201c;You mongrel! You&#x2019;re a few sandwiches short of a picnic!&#x201d;</p><p>After catching his breath, Drake added, &#x201c;You better keep running, Rabbit!&#x201d;</p><p>Still laughing, Chuck muttered to himself, &#x201c;Just another day of oil fossicking in the Merry Old Land of Oz.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite their proximity to the blast, there was no damage to the trucks, other than a shattered passenger-side rearview mirror on Chuck&#x2019;s Jeep. Rabbit Burroughs had been complaining of a headache all day, and had twice mentioned that he thought he was coming down with the flu. That was his explanation for failing to attach the nylon parachute cord that was normally used to slowly lower the seismic testing charges. They laughed off the incident on their drive back to Darwin, although Rabbit Burroughs spent the next three days sick in bed with the flu.</p><p>Two weeks later, the replacement side-mirror assembly Chuck had ordered arrived. He bolted it on without the assistance of the dealership, but when he&#x2019;d finished, he was confronted with a strange sight: His perennially filthy Jeep had one <i>clean</i> mirror housing. It was enough to compel Chuck to take his truck to the car wash for a long-overdue cleaning.</p><p>The self-service car wash on Vanderlin Drive was run by a genial man in his thirties. By his looks, Chuck assumed the man was half Aborigine. Instead of being coin-operated like the car wash in his small hometown in Texas, this one used credit cards for payment. Washing the accumulated red dirt from the truck took three full cycles.</p><p>Chuck wore his cowboy hat as protection from the glaring sun. As he worked, he hummed the tune to the song &#x201c;I&#x2019;m So Ronery&#x201d; from a political parody movie featuring puppets, which he had seen many years before. Just as he was finishing up the last cycle, he heard a woman&#x2019;s voice from behind him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s T-T?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>He turned to see a tall young woman with curly, sandy-brown hair, wearing short pants and a simple blouse. Her index finger was pointing to the large red decal on his truck&#x2019;s back window,...</p></p><h2>Dead Watch</h2><p>Summoned by the White House chief of staff to investigate a series of elected official disappearances, Army intelligence veteran Jacob Winter finds the situation worsening when one of the missing victims is found brutally murdered.

He is the author of the Prey novels, the Kidd novels, the Virgil Flowers novels, <em>The Night Crew</em>, and<em> Dead Watc</em>h. He lives in New Mexico.Former Virginia senator Lincoln Bowe is missing. His wife, Madison, believes his bitter political rival, Governor Arlo Goodman, is behind it. Critics scoff until she reveals a security tape showing two men loosely affiliated with Goodman threatening her in her home. Bowe's disappearance is a political time bomb. The presidential conventions are just over the horizon, and both parties fear the consequences if it detonates. The president, through his chief of staff, hires Jake Winter to investigate. Bowe's body is found soon after Winter initiates his investigation. Bowe was not a saint: his sexual dalliances, with both men and women, were numerous, and his obsession with destroying Goodman's political career may have driven him to contemplate political blackmail. Winter has plenty of suspects to choose from, and he knows the answer can be found somewhere in Washington's backrooms, where third-string campaign dirty tricksters change allegiances like other people change socks. Sandford, the best-selling author of the Prey series, displays an insider's knowledge of political infighting and couples it with his skill at creating memorable characters working through the maze of a diabolical plot. (Readers of a certain age will be reminded of Ross Thomas, grand master of the D.C. thriller from an earlier era.)

Through "personology" (a combination of characteristics influenced by sun sign, season, and day of the year) and an analysis of several thousand character profiles, authors Gary Goldschneider and Joost Elfers have pinned down the traits most common to people born on the same day.<p> Rather than taking a strictly astrological approach--how the planets, sun, and stars affect a person's behavior--the authors compare the commonalties of people who share birthdays, and piece together a personality for each day of the year, effectively slicing through geographical and cultural differences, while avoiding the one-size-fits-all trap of newspaper sun-sign horoscopes. Some readers may find the authors' strict use of the Gregorian calendar limiting, but conversion to other time-keeping systems is fairly simple (the authors make note of this problem and contend that a day is a day, whether someone names it October 21 or 1 Rajab). Goldschneider and Elfers focus on a model of the year as a wheel spinning in a recurring circle of patterns, an idea that reaches back far beyond the linear calendars we use today. Each birthday discussed includes important numbers, tarot cards, and a dose of psychology, so while you learn a little about the other people with your birthday, you may even discover something new about yourself. <i>--Brian Patterson</i></p><b>Gary Goldschneider</b> began his study of human personality with an interest in biographies and psychoanalytic theory.

By war&#x2019;s end, all those closest to her were dead, and she had witnessed firsthand the destruction and suffering of modern combat. <br><br>Much of what we know and feel about the First World War we owe to Brittain&#x2019;s <i>Testament of Youth</i>. In this elegiac yet unsparing memoir, Brittain focused on the men and women who came of age as war broke out, exploring their politics, their hopes, and their fatal idealism. Acclaimed by&nbsp;the<i> Times Literary Supplement</i> as a book that helped &#x201c;both form and define the mood of its time,&#x201d; this searing portrait is also a testament to every generation irrevocably changed by war.</p><p>When war broke out in August 1914, 21-year-old Vera Brittain was planning on enrolling at Somerville College, Oxford. Her father told her she wouldn't be able to go: "In a few months' time we should probably all find ourselves in the Workhouse!" he opined. Brittain had hoped to escape the Northern provinces, but the war seemingly dashed her plans. "It is not, perhaps, so very surprising that the War at first seemed to me an infuriating personal interruption rather than a world-wide catastrophe." <p> Her father eventually relented, however, and she was allowed to attend. By the end of her first year, she had fallen in love with a young soldier and resolved to become active in the war effort by volunteering as a nurse--turning her back on what she called her "provincial young-ladyhood." Brittain suffered through 12-hour days by reminding herself that nothing she endured was worse than what her fianc�, Roland, experienced in the trenches. Roland was expected home on leave for Christmas 1915; on December 26, Brittain received news that he had been killed at the front. Ten months later Brittain herself was sent to Malta and then to France to serve in the hospitals nearer the front, where she witnessed firsthand the horrors of battle. When peace finally came, Brittain had also lost her brother Edward and two close friends. As she walked the streets of London on November 11, 1918--Armistice Day--she felt alone in the crowds:</p><p> </p><blockquote> For the first time I realised, with all that full realisation meant, how completely everything that had hitherto made up my life had vanished with Edward and Roland, with Victor and Geoffrey. The War was over; a new age was beginning; but the dead were dead and would never return. </blockquote><p> First published in 1933, <i>Testament of Youth</i> established Brittain as one of the best-loved authors of her time. Her crisp, clear prose and searing honesty make this unsentimental memoir of a generation scarred by war a classic. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>Vera Brittain</b> (1893&#x2013;1970) served as a nurse in the British armed forces in World War I and afterward devoted herself to the causes of peace and feminism. She wrote twenty-nine books, of which&nbsp;<i>Testament of Youth</i>&nbsp;is the best-known.</p><h2>Dead Heat (Political Thrillers Series #5)</h2><p><b>2009 Retailer's Choice Award winner!</b><br>For Jon and Erin Bennett, the world seems to be spinning dangerously out of control. A new dictator is rising in Iraq. China is making threatening new moves toward Taiwan. North Korean forces appear ready to strike south. Israel is feverishly trying to complete the Third Temple. Oil prices are surging. And in the wake of an horrific war in the Middle East, President James MacPherson's second term is coming to an end. Now the battle to succeed him is heating up into one of the most fiercely contested presidential elections in American history, and the Bennetts realize the stakes could not be higher. Who will lead a bitterly divided country over the next four years? What can the U.S. do to shape the new world order? And just what role&#x2014;if any&#x2014;does the U.S. play in the last days?

Rosenberg's "New York Times" best-selling novels have an uncanny way of coming true. </p><p> The first page of his first thriller, "The Last Jihad," put readers inside the cockpit of a hijacked jet, coming in on a kamikaze attack into an American city . . . but it was written nine months "before" September 11, 2001. As "Jihad" unfolds, an American president finds himself at war with Saddam Hussein over terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . . . but it was published five months "before" the actual war with Iraq began. </p><p> Rosenberg's second novel, "The Last Days," opens with an attack on a U.S. diplomatic convoy heading into Gaza, the death of Yasser Arafat, and radical Islamic terrorists trying to seize the West Bank and Gaza. Two weeks before it was published, a U.S. diplomatic convoy was attacked in Gaza. . . . thirteen months later, Yasser Arafat was dead. . . . and then Hamas seized control of Gaza. </p><p> In "The Ezekiel Option," a dictator rises to power in Russia, an Iranian leader vows to annihilate Israel, and Russia and Iran form an unprecedented military alliance. Then, on the very day the novel came out, Iran elected a new president who vowed to accelerate his country's nuclear program. Four months later, he vowed to "wipe Israel off the map," and then Russia agreed to sell Iran $1 billion worth of high-tech weapons. </p><p> In "The Copper Scroll," an ancient scroll describes unimaginable treasures worth untold billions buried in the hills east of Jerusalem and under the Holy City itself-treasuresthat could come from the Second Temple and whose discovery could lead to the building of the Third Temple and a war of biblical proportions. . . . One month after Rosenberg's fourth novel was released, "Biblical Archeology Review" published a story describing the real-life, intensified hunt for the treasures of the actual Copper Scroll. </p><p> In "Dead Heat"-"the final novel of the series"-readers will be left breathless as Rosenberg embarks on his most exciting and heart-pounding ride yet, a political thriller that will leave you wondering . . .

Can we stop it?"</p>The stage is set for war. <ul><li> Oil prices are surging to record highs.</li><li> A new dictator is rising in Iraq.</li><li> China is threatening Taiwan.</li><li> North Korean forces are ready to strike south.</li><li> Israel is feverishly trying to complete the Third Temple.</li></ul>And in the midst of a world ready to explode, American president James MacPherson&#x2019;s second term is ending.<br><br>The battle to succeed him is heating up into the most fiercely contested presidential election in American history.

Bomboy, Chesterfield County Public Schools, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 1-3. This lively book from the Step into Reading series accomplishes a good deal in a small space. First, it introduces the political situation in prerevolutionary Boston, the famous Tea Party, and Paul Revere, both as a craftsman and as a member of the Sons of Liberty. Next, it recounts Revere's role in the events of April 18 and 19, 1775. Finally, it relates Revere's postwar activities and his ride into immortality via Longfellow's poem. Implying legend, Corey calls two incidents "stories": Revere sending his dog home to retrieve his spurs and, later, wrapping a lady's petticoat around his oars. Varied in composition, O'Leary's pictures have a warm palette and a sense of boundless energy that propels each character and scene.

It's blinding."</p><p>He laughed, reached out to smooth a hand over the hair she'd just ruffled. "We're out of our element, Lieutenant. Maybe it's good for us to be out of the norm now and again."</p><p>She knew her norm. Death, investigation, the insanity of a city that ran instead of walked, the smells of a cop shop, the rush and the burden of command.</p><p>Some of that had become Roarke's norm in the last couple years, she mused. He juggled that with his own world, which was buying, selling, owning, creating pretty much every freaking thing in the known universe.</p><p>His beginnings had been as dark and ugly as hers. Dublin street rat, she thought, thief, conniver, survivor of a brutal, murderous father. The mother he'd never known hadn't been so lucky.</p><p>From that, he'd built an empire not always on the sunny side of the law.</p><p>And she, cop to the bone, had fallen for him despite the shadows or maybe because of them. But there was more to him than either of them had known, and the more lived on a farm outside of the little village of Tulla in County Clare.</p><p>"We could've taken a copter from the hotel," she said to him.</p><p>"I like the drive."</p><p>"I know you mean that, so it makes me wonder about you, pal."</p><p>"We'll take a shuttle when we leave for Florence."</p><p>"No argument."</p><p>"And we'll have a candlelight dinner in our suite." He glanced toward her with that relaxed, happy smile. "The best pizza in the city."</p><p>"Now you're talking."</p><p>"It means a lot to them that we'd come like this together for a couple of days."</p><p>"I like them," she said of his mother's family. "Sinead, the rest. Vacations are good. I just have to work myself into the mode and stop thinking about what's going on back at Central. What do people do here, anyway?"</p><p>"They work, farm, run shops, tend homes and families, go to the pub for a pint and community. Simple doesn't mean unfulfilled."</p><p>She let out a little snort. "You'd go crazy here."</p><p>"Oh, within a week. We're urban creatures, you and I, but I can appreciate those who make this way their own, who value and support community. <i>Comhar</i>," he added, "that's the Irish word for it. It's particular to the west counties."</p><p>There were woods now, sort of looming back from the road, and pretty if you went for that kind of thing stretches of fields divided by low walls of rock she imagined had been mined from the pretty fields.</p><p>She recognized the house when Roarke turned. It managed to be sprawling and tidy at the same time, fronted with flowers in what Roarke had told her they called a <i>dooryard</i>. If buildings sent off an aura, she supposed this one would be content.</p><p>Roarke's mother had grown up here before she'd run off to the bright lights of Dublin. There, young, naive, trusting, she'd fallen in love with Patrick Roarke, had borne his child. And had died trying to save that child.</p><p>Now her twin sister ran the house, helped run the farm with the man she'd married, with their children and siblings, parents the whole brood seemed to root here, in the green.</p><p>Sinead stepped out of the house, telling Eve she'd been watching for them. Her gilded red hair framed her pretty face where green eyes warmed in welcome.</p><p>It wasn't the connection of blood kin that put that affection on her face, or in the arms she stretched out. It was family. Blood, Eve knew, didn't always mean warmth and welcome.</p><p>Sinead caught Roarke in a solid, swaying hug, and as her murmured greeting was in Irish, Eve couldn't understand the words. But the emotion translated.</p><p>This was love, open and accepting.</p><p>When she turned, Eve found herself caught in the same full-on embrace. It widened her eyes, shifted her balance.</p><p>"<i>F�ilte abhaile</i>. Welcome home."</p><p>"Thanks. Ah...;"</p><p>"Come in, come in. We're all in the kitchen or out the back. We've enough food to feed the army we are, and thought we'd have a picnic, as you've brought such nice weather."</p><p>Eve cast a glance up at the sky, and supposed there were degrees of nice weather, depending where you stood on the planet.</p><p>"I'll have one of the boys fetch your bags and take them up to your room. Oh, it's good to see your faces. We're all here now. We're all home."</p><p>They were fed and feted, surrounded and questioned. Eve managed the names and faces by imagining them all as suspects on a murder board even the ones who toddled and crawled.</p><p>Especially the one who kept toddling over and trying to claw its way into her lap.</p><p>"Our Devin's a lady's man." His mother Maggie laughed as she hauled him up, and in the way of some women, lodged him effortlessly on her hip. "Da says you're off to Italy next. Connor and I splurged on our honeymoon and went to Venice. It was brilliant."</p><p>The kid on her hip babbled something and bounced.</p><p>"All right, my man, since we're having a holiday. I'm after getting him another biscuit. Would you like one?"</p><p>"No, thanks. I'm good."</p><p>A moment later, Eve felt an itch between her shoulder blades. Shifting, she saw a boy staring at her. She recognized him the Brody family green eyes, the solar system of freckles from when the family had come to New York the previous Thanksgiving.</p><p>"What's the deal?" she demanded.</p><p>"I'm wondering if you've got your stunner."</p><p>She hadn't worn the harness, but she'd strapped her clutch piece to her ankle. Old habits die hard, she supposed, just as she supposed Sinead and the rest of the females wouldn't appreciate her showing the kid the weapon at a family picnic.</p><p>"Why? Somebody need to go down?"</p><p>He grinned at that. "My sister, if you wouldn't mind."</p><p>"What's the offense?"</p><p>"Being a git. That should be enough."</p><p>She knew the gist of the meaning from Roarke's use of the word when he lapsed into his native slang. "Not in New York, ace. The city's full of gits."</p><p>"I think I'll be a cop and blast the bad guys. How many've you blasted?"</p><p>Bloodthirsty little bastard, Eve thought. She liked him. "No more than my share. Putting them in a cage is more satisfying than blasting them."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"It lasts longer."</p><p>He considered that. "Well now, I'll blast them first, then put them in a cage."</p><p>When she laughed, he shot out another grin. "We don't get bad guys around here, and that's a pity. Maybe I'll come to New York again, and you can show me some of yours."</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>"That'll be frosted!" he said, and bolted off.</p><p>The minute he did, someone plopped down beside her and pushed a fresh pint into her hand. Seamus, she identified, Sinead's oldest son. She was pretty sure.</p><p>"So, how're you finding Ireland then?"</p><p>"We went east from New York. Green," she added when he chuckled and gave her a friendly elbow in the ribs. "With a lot of sheep. And good beer."</p><p>"Every shepherd deserves a pint of an evening. You've made my mother very happy, taking this time to come, be with family. She thinks of Roarke as hers now, in her sister's place. What you're doing for her, and for him, it matters."</p><p>"It doesn't take much effort to sit around and drink good beer."</p><p>He patted her thigh. "It's a long way to travel for a pint. Added to it, you've thrilled my boy to pieces."</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"My Sean, who was just here interrogating you."</p><p>"Oh. It's hard to figure who's whose."</p><p>"Sure it is. Since we visited you last year, he's given up his dream of being a space pirate in favor of being a cop and blasting bad guys for his living."</p><p>"He mentioned it."</p><p>"Truth be known he's wishing desperately for a murder while you're about. Something gruesome and mysterious."</p><p>"Get a lot of those around here?"</p><p>He sat back, took a contemplative sip of beer. "The last I recall was when old Mrs. O'Riley broke her husband's head with a skillet when he, once again, came home pissed and smelling of another woman's perfume. I suppose it was gruesome enough, but not altogether mysterious. That would be about a dozen years back."</p><p>"Not much action in the area for a murder cop."</p><p>"Sadly for Sean, no. He likes to follow your cases, searching out tidbits on his computer. This last? The hologames murder gave him endless thrills."</p><p>"Oh." She glanced over to where Roarke stood with Sinead, her arm around his waist. And thought of the blade slicing into his side.</p><p>"We've a parental lock on, so he can't get the juicier details."</p><p>"Yeah, that's probably a good thing."</p><p>"How bad was he hurt, my cousin? The media didn't have much on that which is, I suppose, how he wanted it."</p><p>His blood, warm, sliding through her shaking fingers. "Bad enough."</p><p>Seamus nodded, lips pursed as he studied Roarke. "He's not at all his father's son, is he then?"</p><p>"Not where it counts."</p><p>Irish picnics, Eve discovered, went on for hours, as did the Irish summer day, and included music, dancing, and general carryings-on till well after the stars winked on.</p><p>"We've kept you up late." Sinead walked them upstairs, this time wrapping an arm around Eve's waist.</p><p>Eve never knew exactly what to do when people looped their arms around her unless it was combat, or Roarke.</p><p>"After all your travels, too. Barely giving you time to unpack, and none at all to settle in."</p><p>"It was a nice party."</p><p>"It was, it was, yes. And now my Seamus talked Roarke into going out in the field in the morning." She gave Eve a little squeeze. At the signal, Eve glanced back at Roarke.</p><p>"Seriously. In the field, like farm field?" Eve said.</p><p>"I'll enjoy it. I've never driven a tractor."</p><p>"I hope you say the same when we're dragging you out of bed at half-six."</p><p>"He hardly sleeps anyway," Eve commented. "He's like a droid."</p><p>Sinead laughed, opened the door to their bedroom. "Well, I hope you'll be comfortable for the time you have." She looked around the room with its simple furniture, its soft colors, and white lace at the windows under the slant of the ceiling.</p><p>Flowers, a charm of colors and shapes, stood in a squat pot on the dresser.</p><p>"If you need a thing, anything at all, I'm just down the hall."</p><p>"We'll be fine." Roarke turned to her, kissed her cheek. "More than."</p><p>"I'll see you at breakfast then. Sleep well."</p><p>She slipped out, shut the doo...</p></p><h2>Laddie: A True Blue Story (Library of Indiana Classics)</h2><p><p>Loosely based on Stratton-Porter&#x2019;s own childhood, Laddie is a double tale&#x2015;the classic poor-boy/rich-girl romance and the story of a child of nature and her idyllic childhood.</p></p><p>The narrative mode of &#39;Laddie&#39; may prevent an easy suspension of disbelief to some readers.

In <i>Aesthetics and Politics </i>the key texts of the great Marxist controversies over literature and art during these years are assembled in a single volume. They do not form a disparate collection but a continuous, interlinked debate between thinkers who have become giants of twentieth-century intellectual history.</p><p><b>Theodor Adorno</b> was director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt from 1956 until his death in 1969. His works include <i>In Search of Wagner</i>; <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>; <i>Negative Dialectics</i>; and (with Max Horkheimer) <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> and <i>Towards a New Manifesto</i>.<br><br><b>Walter Benjamin</b> was a German-Jewish Marxist literary critic, essayist, translator, and philosopher.

An influential theater practitioner of the 20th century, Brecht made equally significant contributions to dramaturgy and theatrical production, the latter particularly through the seismic impact of the tours undertaken by the Berliner Ensemble&#x2014;the post-war theater company operated by Brecht and his wife and long-time collaborator, the actress Helene Weigel&#x2014;with its internationally acclaimed productions.<br><br><b>Georg Luk�cs </b> (1885&#x2013;1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic.

But parents also want to have influence. They want their kid to be independent, but not if he or she is going to make bad choices. They don't want to be harsh and rigid, but nor do they want a noncompliant, disrespectful kid. They want to avoid being too pushy and overbearing, but not if an unmotivated, apathetic kid is what they have to show for it. They want to have a good relationship with their kids, but not if that means being a pushover. They don't want to scream, but they do want to be heard. Good parenting is about striking the balance between a child's characteristics and a parent's desire to have influence.<br> <br>Now Dr. Ross Greene offers a detailed and practical guide for raising kids in a way that enhances relationships, improves communication, and helps kids learn how to resolve disagreements without conflict. Through his well-known model of solving problems collaboratively, parents can forgo time-out and sticker charts, stop badgering, berating, threatening, and punishing, allow their kids to feel heard and validated, and have influence. From homework to hygiene, curfews, to screen time, <i>Raising Human Beings</i> arms parents with the tools they need to raise kids in ways that are non-punitive and non-adversarial and that brings out the best in both parent and child.</p><p>"I wrote <i>Raising Human Beings</i> because it's quite clear that <i>all</i> kids -- not merely those with significant behavioral challenges -- benefit from being involved in the process of solving the problems that affect their lives and learning how to work toward mutually satisfactory solutions. And because I've been really concerned about societal trends that have been to the disadvantage of our kids and caused many kids to focus a lot more on <i>me</i> than on <i>we. &nbsp;</i>The problems that affect us all are going to require that we resolve them in ways that are for the collective good rather than solely for individuals. &nbsp;And because, while it's true that kids and parents are definitely going to disagree sometimes...and that kids are definitely going to have difficulty meeting expectations sometimes...those disagreements and unmet expectations don't need to cause conflict." -- Ross GreeneDr. Ross W.

If Satan can destroy the image, then he can avert his own destruction. The prophecy of Genesis 3:15 states the serpent will one day mix his seed with humanity as a counterfeit of the Messiah. Jesus told us that the last days will be like the days of Noah when fallen angels mixed their seed with humanity. In the Book of Daniel we read that &#x201c;they&#x201d; will again mingle with the seed of men. How so? Satan will use man&#x2019;s desire to be his own god to deceive him into believing the ultimate lie &#x2013; that his fallen messengers are both the creators and saviors of man. He will not do this openly but will deceive mankind through demons which are masquerading as &#x201d;aliens&#x201d; who are spreading the message that the inhabitants of the earth can evolve to be like them and obtain transcendent powers. Finally, the seed of the Serpent will come; he will be a man who will be greater than his fellows, who will understand sinister schemes and shall rise up and become the Antichrist. That day of fulfillment is nearly upon us!</p><p>Douglas Hamp, author of Discovering the Language of Jesus, The First Six Days and Corrupting the Image earned his MA in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.

With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits-a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century-denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts. Injecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.</p><p></p><h2>The Mad Scientists&#39; Club</h2><p>The six members of the Mad Scientists&#39; Club experiment with new projects which include investigating a strange sea monster and the theft of a valuable dinosaur egg.</p><p>After attending Stanford University, where he majored in Economics and Speech, BERTRAND R.

He entered the Army in 1944 and served fifteen years in a variety of infantry and public relations assignments, including position of aide-de-camp to the chief of the United Nations delegation during the Korean armistice negotiations. He retired from active duty in order to devote himself to writing, and held a commission as major in the United States Army Reserve. He later worked in technical writing and public relations positions for the Martin Company. <p>The author of <i>Rocket Manual for Amateurs</i>, Bertrand Brinley lectured extensively to schools and civics groups on space age topics. His articles and stories appeared in <i>Harper's Magazine, Boys' Life, Family Weekly, Woman's Day, The Microwave Journal, Electronics Illustrated</i> and <i>The Book of Knowledge.</i> </p><p>Bertrand Brinley is well-known for his beloved tales of the Mad Scientists' Club, whose further antics can be found in <i>The New Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club, The Big Kerplop!</i> and <i>The Big Chunk of Ice.</i></p>Dinky Poore didn't really mean to start the story about the huge sea monster in Strawberry Lake. He was only telling a fib because he had to have an excuse for getting home late for supper. So he told his folks he'd been running around the lake trying to get a closer look at a huge, snakelike thing he'd seen in the water, and the first thing he knew he was too far from home to get back in time. <p>His mother and father greeted the tale with some skepticism. But Dinky's two sisters were more impressionable, and that's how the story really got out. They kept pestering him for so many details about the monster that he had to invent a fantastic tale to satisfy them. That's one of the troubles with a lie. You've got to keep adding to it to make it believable to people. </p><p>It didn't take long for the story to get around town, and pretty soon Dinky Poore was a celebrity in Mammoth Falls. He even had his picture in the paper, together with an "artists conception" of the thing he'd seen. It was gruesome-looking -- something like a dinosaur, but with a scaly, saw-toothed back like a dragon. Dinky was never short on imagination, and he was able to give the artist plenty of details. </p><p>It was the artists' sketch in the newspaper that got Henry Mulligan all excited. Henry is First Vice President and also Chief of Research for the Mad Scientists' Club and is noted for his brainstorms. Neither Henry nor anyone else in the club actually believed Dinky had seen a real monster, but we were all willing to play along with the gag -- especially when Henry suggested that we could build a monster just like the one shown in the newspaper.</p></p><h2>A Tale for the Time Being</h2><p>On a remote island in the Pacific Northwest, a Hello Kitty lunchbox washes up on the beach. Tucked inside is a collection of curious items, including the diary of a sixteenyear-old Japanese girl named Nao Yasutani. Ruth, who finds the lunchbox, suspects that it is debris from Japan&#x2019;s devastating 2011 tsunami. Once Ruth starts to read the diary, she quickly finds herself drawn into the mystery of the young girl&#x2019;s fate. <p>In a manga caf� in Tokyo&#x2019;s Electric Town, Nao has decided there&#x2019;s only one escape from the loneliness and pain of her life, as she&#x2019;s uprooted from her U.S. home, bullied at school, and watching her parents spiral deeper into disaster. But before she ends it all, she wants to accomplish one thing: to recount the story of her great-grandmother, a 104-year-old Zen Buddhist nun, in the pages of her diary. The diary, Nao&#x2019;s only solace, is her cry for help to a reader she can only imagine.</p> <p></p> <p>Full of Ozeki&#x2019;s signature humour and insight, <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home<b>.</b> </p></p><p><b>RUTH OZEKI </b>is an award-winning writer and filmmaker.

Dualities, overlaps, time shifts, and coincidences are the currents that move <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> along: This is a book that does not give up its multiple meanings easily, gently but insistently instructing the reader to progress slowly in order to contemplate the porous membrane that separates fact from fiction, self from circumstance, past from present.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Plunges us into a tantalizing narration that brandishes mysteries to be solved and ideas to be explored.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;A delightful yet sometimes harrowing novel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many of the elements of Nao&#x2019;s story&#x2014;schoolgirl bullying, unemployed suicidal &#x2018;salarymen,&#x2019; kamikaze pilots&#x2014;are among a Western reader&#x2019;s most familiar images of Japan, but in Nao&#x2019;s telling, refracted through Ruth&#x2019;s musings, they become fresh and immediate, occasionally searingly painful. Ozeki takes on big themes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all drawn into the stories of two &#x2018;time beings,&#x2019; Ruth and Nao, whose own fates are inextricably bound.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;A terrific novel full of breakthroughs both personal and literary&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ozeki revels in Tokyo teen culture&#x2014;this goes far beyond Hello Kitty&#x2014;and explores quantum physics, military applications of computer video games, Internet bullying, and Marcel Proust, all while creating a vulnerable and unique voice for the sixteen-year-old girl at its center.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating multigenerational tapestry of long ago, recent past, and present&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

When Nao learns to meditate at Jiko&#x2019;s temple she says, &#x2018;When you return your mind to zazen, it feels like coming home.&#x2019; Ultimately this satisfying novel is about discovering home in the moment, or now, and also home within ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Oregonian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Beautifully written, intensely readable, and richly layered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ozeki moves between Ruth&#x2019;s and Nao&#x2019;s stories and their very different voices while exploring the elements of time, past, present (whatever that is, in the context of this book), and, perhaps, the future. Nao stays with her Jiko and meets the ghost of her great-uncle Haruki, a kamikaze pilot; Ruth makes a mysterious journey and has an important encounter of her own. The human relationships are deftly explored.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> is compelling and memorable, one of the best books of the year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i></p><p>&#x201c;Forget the proverbial message in a bottle: This <i>Tale</i> fractures clich�s as it affirms the lifesaving power of words.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Ruth Ozeki creates multiple worlds that are alive and filled with so much sensory details and symbolism and it&#x2019;s difficult not to resist being completely immersed. Stock your fridge, finish the laundry, and feed the cat because you&#x2019;ll be busy for a few days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Hyphen</i></p><p>&#x201c;A multilayered postmodern fantasia with a heart of gold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Ellis Avery, <i>Public Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i>, Ruth Ozeki pulls out all the stops with her new cast of beautiful, batty, and sad characters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#x2019;s such a romp&#x2014;so unafraid of the disasters of life, so full of delight&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s well worth the read. Forget the easy escape route of quantum mechanics; the novel more than supplies enough old-fashioned reading magic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Shambhala Sun</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ozeki is a fantastic novelist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Sunday Times </i>(London)</p><p>&#x201c;A deep and illuminating piece of work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i> (London)</p><p>&#x201c;A huge, compassionate, and cleverly wrought novel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ozeki beautifully captures Nao&#x2019;s teenage voice, with its conflicting harmonies of bathos and intensity, stoicism and optimism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As the novel draws to a close, with an extended riff on quantum mechanics, Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat, and the influence of perception on physical reality, the readers shares with Ruth a series of revelations about the human need for resolution and the impossibility of getting it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> (London)</p><p>&#x201c;Links have been made between Buddhism and modern quantum physics before, but seldom can they have been intertwined with such emotive power and linguistic grace as Ruth Ozeki manages in this funny, heartbreaking, moving, and profound novel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

In its shift to a novel of ideas, through a carefully wrought yet seemingly reckless narrative explosion, the novel shines. It is not only a storytelling tour de force (and rest assured, Ozeki doesn&#x2019;t abandon either the richness of her characterizations nor the expanding force of the paired story lines in favor of the deeper searching; everything resolves, though not in a manner that anyone would expect), but a rich, thought-provoking, paradigm-disturbing experience of a novel. Like a Zen koan, <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> defies simple answers or explanations even as it reveals all. You will carry it with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Vancouver Sun</i></p><p>&#x201c;A magical narrative that dances in all worlds at once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Ozeki&#x2019;s maximalist style puts her in the realms of David Foster Wallace or early David Mitchell but, unlike almost any other postmodern author for whom concepts frequently trump character, Ozeki can pluck at the heartstrings like a samisen, offering moments that bring hand to mouth in both horror and joy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> (Australia)</p><p>&#x201c;Ruth Ozeki&#x2019;s parallel narratives stretch the reader to appreciate them fully. You are never going to get anything less than profoundly interesting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her real skill, though, is in blending concept and story so beautifully. The result is a novel that is clever on many levels but also immensely readable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>The New Zealand Herald</i></p><p>&#x201c;A quietly amazing achievement&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a good read that reverberates in thought long after the final page&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Ozeki expresses our universal desire to connect with others through words and stories. Her characters speak to us across time and across continents and beckon us to follow them to unknown worlds. Equal parts sobering and inspiring, the novel is wholly inventive from the first page to the last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> is destined to become a modern classic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Book Magnet</i></p><p>&#x201c;An enthralling, beautiful novel about relationships, time, history, and culture.

The characters&#x2019; lives are finely drawn, from Ruth&#x2019;s rustic lifestyle to the Yasutani family&#x2019;s straitened existence after moving from Sunnyvale, California, to Tokyo. Nao&#x2019;s winsome voice contrasts with Ruth&#x2019;s intellectual ponderings to make up a lyrical disquisition on writing&#x2019;s power to transcend time and place. This tale from Ozeki, a Zen Buddhist priest, is sure to please anyone who values a good story broadened with intellectual vigor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An extraordinary novel about a courageous young woman, riven by loneliness, by time, and (ultimately) by tsunami.

Tempted by the hazy, nostalgic memories of summers past - childhood innocence and the romance and rivalries of her teens - it's the perfect place to flee after her broken engagement. But what began as an escape may just be a new beginning...As Olivia uncovers secrets buried thick with dust, one by one her family return, their lives as frayed at the edges as the resort. Her father and the mystery woman in the tatty black and white photograph. Uncle John, who's trying to be a father again to his teenage kids. Connor Davis, the first love she never forgot. Laughter is ringing around Willow Lake once more. This could be Olivia's summer of a lifetime!i??Perfect for fans of Cathy Kelly</p><p>When Susan Wiggs's recent novel, <i>Fireside</i>, landed at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, the author responded by jumping fully clothed into her swimming pool. In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos. She toasted her loyal readers, whose unflagging interest in her books propelled her sales upward. She toasted her friends and family as well, since they have always been the source of her inspiration. From the very start, her writings have illuminated the everyday dramas of ordinary people. At the age of eight, she self-published her first novel, entitled A Book About Some Bad Kids. Today, she is an international best-selling author, with millions of copies of her books in print in numerous countries. Her Lakeshore Chronicles novels celebrate the power of love, the timeless bonds of family and the nuances of human nature that make headlines every day. She lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest and is perpetually working on her next novel.<i>Summer 1991</i><p> "Lolly." The tall, lanky boy hiking up the trail behind her spoke for the first time since they left base camp. "What the hell kind of name is Lolly?"</p><p> "The kind that's stenciled on the back of my shirt," she said, flipping a brown pigtail over one shoulder. To her dismay, she felt herself blushing. Cripes, he was just a dumb boy, and all he'd done was ask her a simple question.</p><p> Wrong, she thought, hearing a game-show buzz in her head. He was pretty much the cutest boy in Eagle Lodge, the twelve-to-fourteens. And it hadn't been a question so much as a smart remark designed to rattle her. Plus, he said<i> hell.</i> Lolly would never admit it, but she didn't like swearing. Whenever she tried saying a swearword herself, she always stammered and blushed, and everyone could instantly see how uncool she was. "Got it," the kid muttered, and as soon as the trail curved around a bend, he passed her with a rude muttering that was probably meant to be an "Excuse me." He trudged on, whistling an old Talking Heads tune without missing a note.</p><p> They were doing a pairs hike, the first activity of the season. It was designed to familiarize them with the camp layout, and with another camper. They had been paired up as they'd gotten off the bus, while their duffel bags and belongings were being sorted and taken to their cabins. She had wound up with the lanky boy because they had both been last to dis-embark. She had folded her arms across her chest and sniffed, "I'm your new best friend." </p><p> He'd taken one look at her and shrugged, saying with an air of false nobility, "Barkis is willing."</p><p> The show-off. Lolly had pretended not to be impressed to hear him quoting from <i>David Copperfield. </i>She had also pretended not to see the way some of the other boys snickered and elbowed him, ribbing him for getting stuck with Lolly Bellamy. </p><p> He wasn't the typical Kioga camper, and as someone who had been coming here since she was eight years old, she would know. This boy, a first-timer, was rough around the edges, his hair too long, his cargo shorts too low-slung. Maybe he even looked a little dangerous, with his pale blue eyes and dark hair, a combination that was both cool and disconcerting. </p><p> Through gaps in the trees, she could see people walking in pairs or foursomes, chattering away. It was only the first day of camp, yet already, kids were figuring out who they were going to be friends with this year. Lolly already knew they had ruled her out, of course. They always did. If it wasn't for her cousins, she'd be up a tree, for sure.</p><p> She pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose, and felt a dull thud of envy in her gut as she looked at the other campers, who already seemed totally at ease around one another. Even the new ones, like the lanky boy, seemed to fit in. Fresh off the camp bus, they strolled side by side, yakking away and laughing. Some of the girls wore their camp hoodies slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, their innate fashion sense evident even with the regulation clothes. Most of the boys had their Kioga bandannas tied around their foreheads, Rambo style. Everybody strutted about as though they owned the place.</p><p> And of course, that was kind of funny. None of these kids owned Kioga. But Lolly did.</p><p> Well, in a way. The summer camp belonged to her nana and granddad. Back when she was in the Fledglings, the eight-to-elevens, she used to lord her status over the other kids, but it never really worked. Most kids didn't give a hoot about that.</p><p> The tall boy found a hickory stick and used it to beat at the underbrush or to lean on as he walked. His gaze darted around watchfully, as though he expected something to jump out at him.</p><p> "So I guess your name is Ronnoc," she said at last.</p><p> He scowled and shot a glance over his shoulder at her. "Huh?"</p><p> "Says so on the back of your shirt."</p><p> "It's inside out, genius."</p><p> "It was just a joke."</p><p> "Ha, ha." He stabbed the hickory stick into the ground.</p><p> Their destination was the summit of Saddle Mountain, which wasn't exactly a mountain, more like a big hill. Once they finally reached the top, they'd find a fire pit with log benches arranged in a circle around it. This was the site of many camp traditions. Nana once said that in the days of the first settlers, travelers would make signal fires at high points like this one in order to communicate long-distance. It was on the tip of Lolly's tongue to share the bit of trivia with her partner, but she clamped her mouth shut.</p><p> She had already made up her mind not to like this kid. Truth be told, she had made up her mind not to like anybody this summer. Her two favorite cousins, Frankie -- short for Francine -- and Dare, usually came with her, and they always made Lolly feel as if she had actual friends. But this year, they were driving to California with their parents, Aunt Peg and Uncle Clyde. Lolly's own parents didn't do that kind of traveling. They only did the kind you could brag about afterward. Her parents pretty much liked anything they could brag about -- trips, real estate, antiques, artwork. They even bragged about Lolly, but that was a stretch. Especially now, after sixth grade, the year her marks went down and her weight went up. The year of the divorce.</p><p> Now, <i>there's</i> something to brag about, she thought. "We're supposed to learn three things about each other," said the boy who had no sense of humor, the boy she didn't want to befriend. "Then when we get to the top, we have to introduce each other to the group."</p><p> "I don't want to know three things about you," she said airily.</p><p> "Yeah, well. Ditto."</p><p> The getting-to-know-you fireside chat was always tedious, which was a shame, because it didn't have to be. The little kids were best at it because they didn't know which things to keep to themselves, and which to share. Lolly was a perfect example of that. A year ago, she'd blurted out, "My parents are getting a divorce" and had dissolved into tears, and her life had been a nightmare ever since. But at least back then, her admission had been genuine. In this age group, she already knew the introductions would be totally boring or phony or both.</p><p> "I wish we could skip it," she said. "It's going to be a complete drag. The younger kids are more interesting because at least they'll say anything."</p><p> "What do you mean, anything?"</p><p> "Like if their uncle is being investigated by the SEC or their brother has a third nipple."</p><p> "A what?"</p><p> Lolly probably shouldn't have brought it up, but she knew he'd bug her until she explained. "You heard me," she said.</p><p> "A third nipple. That's total BS. Nobody has that."</p><p> "Huh. Bebe Blackmun once told the whole group that her brother has three."</p><p> "Did you see it?" he challenged.</p><p> "Like I would even want to." She shuddered. "Ew."</p><p> "It's bullshit."</p><p> She sniffed, determined to appear unimpressed by his swearing. "I bet you have an extra one." She didn't know why she said it. She knew the chances of him having three nipples were zip.</p><p> "Yeah, right," he said, stopping on the trail and turning. In one graceful motion, he peeled off his T-shirt right there in the woods, in front of her face, so fast she didn't have time to react.</p><p> "You want to count 'em?" he demanded.</p><p> Her face lit with a blush and she marched past him, staring straight ahead. Idiot, she thought. I am such an idiot. What was I thinking?</p><p> "Maybe <i>you</i> have three nipples," he said with mocking laughter in his voice. "Maybe I should count yours."</p><p> "You're crazy." She kept marching.</p><p> "You're the one who brought it up."</p><p> "I was just trying to make conversation because you're totally, one hundred percent b<i>ooo</i>ring."</p><p> "Uh-huh," he said. "That's me. B<i>ooo</i>ring." He sashayed around her, mimicking her walk. He hadn't put his shirt back on but had tucked it in the back waistband of his cargo shorts. With the <i>First-Blood </i>headband and the shirt hanging down like the back half of a loincloth, he looked like a savage. Very <i>Lord of the Flies.</i></p><p> He was a total show-off. He -- </p><p> She stumbled over a tree root, and had to grab for a nearby branch to steady herself. He turned, and she could have sworn she'd seen his arm flash out to keep her from falling, but he quickly resumed walking without touching her. She stared at him, not to be rude or nosy but this time out of concern.</p><p> "What's that on your back?" she asked bluntly.</p><p> "What?" Mr. Lord of the Flies scowled unpleasantly at her.</p><p> "At first I thought you forgot to bathe, but I think you have a really huge bruise." She pointed to the back of his rib cage.</p><p> He stopped and twisted around, his face almost comically contorted. "I don't have any stinking bruise. Man, you're kind of creepy. Extra nipples and now phantom bruises."</p><p> "I'm looking right at it." In spite of her annoyance at him, she felt a small twinge of compassion. The bruise was healing. She could tell by the way the color bloomed in the middle and faded at the edges. But it must've really hurt when it happened.</p><p> His eyes narrowed and his face turned hard, and for a second, he looked menacing. "It's nothing," he stated. "I fell off my bike. Big deal." He whipped around and kept going, hurrying so that Lolly had to rush to keep up.</p><p> "Look, I didn't mean to make you mad."</p><p> "I'm not mad at you," he barked at her, and walked even faster.</p><p> That was quick, she thought. Her first enemy of the summer. There were sure to be many more to follow. She had a knack for bringing out dislike in people.</p><p> Even though Connor said he wasn't mad at her, he was mad about something. There was fury in his taut muscles, his sharp movements. Big deal, so he hurt himself riding a bike. Usually when you fell off a bike, though, the casualties were elbows and knees, maybe the head. Not the back, unless you went tumbling down a hill and slammed into something really hard. Unless you were lying about what really happened.</p><p> She was both intrigued by and disappointed in this boy. Disappointed because she desperately wanted to dislike him and not have to think about him again, all summer long. And intrig...</p></p><h2>The Uplift War (The Uplift Saga, Book 3)</h2><p>David Brin's Uplift novels are among the most thrilling and extraordinary science fiction ever written.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sundiver, Startide Rising,</i> and <i>The Uplift War</i>--a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller--together make up one of the most beloved sagas of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brin's tales are set in a future universe in which no species can reach sentience without being "uplifted" by a patron race.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greatest mystery of all remains unsolved: who uplifted humankind?<br><br>As galactic armadas clash in quest of the ancient fleet of the Progenitors, a brutal alien race seizes the dying planet of Garth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The various uplifted inhabitants of Garth must battle their overlords or face ultimate extinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;At stake is the existence of Terran society and Earth, and the fate of the entire Five Galaxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping, brilliantly crafted, inventive and dramatic, <i>The Uplift War</i> is an unforgettable story of adventure and wonder from one of today's science fiction greats.</p><p>Billions of years ago, an alien race known as the Progenitors began the genetically engineered techniques by which non-intelligent creatures are given intelligence by one of the higher races in the galaxy.

Turn on a single lamp and read it while you're alone in an otherwise dark room or while someone sleeps next to you. Say it over to yourself in a place where silence reigns and the din of culture-the constant buzzing noise that surrounds you-has momentarily stopped. This poem has come from a great distance to find you." So begins this astonishing book by one of our leading poets and critics. In an unprecedented exploration of the genre, Hirsch writes about what poetry is, why it matters, and how we can open up our imaginations so that its message-which is of vital importance in day-to-day life-can reach us and make a difference. For Hirsch, poetry is not just a part of life, it is life, and expresses like no other art our most sublime emotions. In a marvelous reading of world poetry, including verse by such poets as Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Pablo Neruda, William Wordsworth, Sylvia Plath, Charles Baudelaire, and many more, Hirsch discovers the meaning of their words and ideas and brings their sublime message home into our hearts. A masterful work by a master poet, this brilliant summation of poetry and human nature will speak to all readers who long to place poetry in their lives but don't know how to read it.<br></p><p>Edward Hirsch's primer may very well inspire readers to catch the next flight for Houston and sign up for any and all of his courses. Not for nothing does this attentive and adoring poet-teacher title his book <i>How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry</i>; Hirsch's big guide to getting the most out of this form is packed with inspiring examples and thousands of epigrams and allusions. Above all, he is intent on poetry's physical and emotional power. In chapters devoted to the lyric, the narrative, the poetry of sorrow, of ecstasy, of witness, Hirsch continually conveys the sheer ecstasy of this vital act of communication. (He takes us, for instance, with great care and mounting excitement, through Emily Bront�'s "Spellbound," which he discovered at age 8 when "baseball season was over for the year.") Above all, there is the thrill of discovery as Hirsch offers up works by artists ranging from Anna Akhmatova to Walt Whitman, Elizabeth Bishop to Adam Zagajewski, and everyone in between. I defy you not to fall in love with Wislawa Szymborska on the basis of "The Joy of Writing," which begins: <blockquote> Why does this written doe bound through these written woods?<br> For a drink of written water from a spring<br> whose surface will xerox her soft muzzle?<br> Why does she lift her head; does she hear something?<br> Perched on four slim legs borrowed from the truth,<br> she pricks up her ears beneath my fingertips. </blockquote> Elsewhere, Hirsch's section on Sterling Brown's redefinitions of African American work songs should put this neglected poet back on the map. And his introductions to Eastern European poets such as Jir� Orten, Attila J�zsef, and Mikl�s Radn�ti will make you want to ferret out their hard-to-find work. (Perhaps his publisher should put out a companion anthology...) <p> Hirsch manages to cram entire worlds and lives into 258 pages of text (which he follows up with a huge glossary and extended reading list). His two paragraphs on Juan Gelman, whose son was murdered and pregnant daughter-in-law disappeared during Argentina's "Dirty War," bring this man's art into clear, tragic focus. But even here, the compulsively generous author is compelled to enshrine the words of other critics, foregrounding Eduardo Galeano and Julio Cort�zar, who describes Gelman's art as "a permanent caress of words on unknown tombs." What a pleasure it is to be inside Hirsch's head! He seems to have read everything and absorbed most of it, and he wears his considerable scholarship lightly. Many of his fellow poets have suffered for their art, have been imprisoned and killed--but above all, Hirsch makes us realize that, no matter what the artist's circumstances, subject, or theme, "the stakes are always high" in this game that writer and reader alike must keep playing. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Edward Hirsch is a professor of English at the University of Houston.

No one alive remembers that first horrific onslaught and no one believes in its return--except for the dragonriders. For two centuries they have been practicing and training, passing down from generation to generation the formidable Threadfighting techniques. <br><br>Now the ominous signs are appearing: the violent winter storms and volcanic eruptions that are said to herald the approach of the Red Star and its lethal spawn. But one stubborn Lord Holder, Chalkin of Bitra, refuses to believe--and that disbelief could spell disaster. So as the dragonriders desperately train to face a terrifying enemy, they and the other Lord Holders must find a way to deal with Chalkin--before history repeats itself and unleashes its virulence on all of Pern. . . .<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>When the volcanoes rumble and the powerful storms begin brewing on Pern, it means one thing: Thread. For 257 years Pern has been free of the life-destroying Thread, but now the Red Star has reappeared in the sky and soon the deadly Threadfall will follow. In the holds and weyrs across the land, the genetically-engineered dragons of Pern and their human riders begin feverishly training to combat the Thread, for only dragon fire can destroy the silvery invaders. But, incredibly, one Lord Holder refuses to believe the Thread will fall again, and he may endanger the entire planet.There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor</p><h2>Understanding Politics &amp; Government</h2><p>Understanding politics is essential to understand the world around you.

Drawing on internal memos, classified documents, meeting notes and hundreds of hours of interviews with most of the key players, including the president, Woodward tells the inside story of Obama making the critical decisions on the Afghanistan War, the secret campaign in Pakistan and the worldwide fight against terrorism.<br><br>At the core of <em>Obama's Wars</em> is the unsettled division between the civilian leadership in the White House and the United States military as the president is thwarted in his efforts to craft an exit plan for the Afghanistan War.<br><br>"So what's my option?" the president asked his war cabinet, seeking alternatives to the Afghanistan commander's request for 40,000 more troops in late 2009. "You have essentially given me one option.... It's unacceptable."<br><br>"Well," Secretary of Defense Robert Gates finally said, "Mr. President, I think we owe you that option."<br><br>It never came. An untamed Vice President Joe Biden pushes relentlessly to limit the military mission and avoid another Vietnam. The vice president frantically sent half a dozen handwritten memos by secure fax to Obama on the eve of the final troop decision.<br><br>President Obama's ordering a surge of 30,000 troops and pledging to start withdrawing U.S. forces by July 2011 did not end the skirmishing.<br><br>General David Petraeus, the new Afghanistan commander, thinks time can be added to the clock if he shows progress. "I don't think you win this war," Petraeus said privately. "This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."<br><br>Hovering over this debate is the possibility of another terrorist attack in the United States. The White House led a secret exercise showing how unprepared the government is if terrorists set off a nuclear bomb in an American city--which Obama told Woodward is at the top of the list of what he worries about all the time.<br><br>Verbatim quotes from secret debates and White House strategy sessions--and firsthand accounts of the thoughts and concerns of the president, his war council and his generals--reveal a government in conflict, often consumed with nasty infighting and fundamental disputes.<br><br>Woodward has discovered how the Obama White House really works, showing that even more tough decisions lie ahead for the cerebral and engaged president.<br><br><em>Obama's Wars</em> offers the reader a stunning, you-are-there account of the president, his White House aides, military leaders, diplomats and intelligence chiefs in this time of turmoil and danger.<br><br><strong>From the <em>Washington Post<br></em></strong>By Steve Luxenberg, September 22, 2010:<br><br>President Obama urgently looked for a way out of the war in Afghanistan last year, repeatedly pressing his top military advisers for an exit plan that they never gave him, according to secret meeting notes and documents cited in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.<br><br>Frustrated with his military commanders for consistently offering only options that required significantly more troops, Obama finally crafted his own strategy, dictating a classified six-page "terms sheet" that sought to limit U.S. involvement, Woodward reports in <em>Obama's Wars</em>.<br><br>According to Woodward's meeting-by-meeting, memo-by-memo account of the 2009 Afghan strategy review, the president avoided talk of victory as he described his objectives.<br><br>"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan," Obama is quoted as telling White House aides as he laid out his reasons for adding 30,000 troops in a short-term escalation. "Everything we're doing has to be focused on how we're going to get to the point where we can reduce our footprint. It's in our national security interest.

Twelve of those have been #1 national bestsellers.&nbsp;<b><b><i>1</i><br>&nbsp;</b></b><br><br>On Thursday, November 6, 2008, two days after he was elected president of the United States, Senator Barack Obama arranged to meet in Chicago with Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence (DNI).<br><br>McConnell, 65, a retired Navy vice admiral with stooped shoulders, wisps of light brown hair and an impish smile, had come to present details of the most highly classified intelligence operations and capabilities of the vast American espionage establishment he oversaw as DNI. In just 75 days, the formidable powers of the state would reside with the 47-year-old Obama. He would soon be, as the intelligence world often called the president, &#x201c;The First Customer.&#x201d;<br><br>McConnell arrived early at the Kluczynski Federal Building, an austere Chicago skyscraper, with Michael J. Morell, who had been President George W. Bush&#x2019;s presidential briefer on 9/11 and now headed the Central Intelligence Agency&#x2019;s analysis division.<br><br>Two members of Senator Obama&#x2019;s transition team from the last Democratic administration greeted them: John Podesta, Bill Clinton&#x2019;s chief of staff for the final two years of his presidency, and James Steinberg, a former deputy national security adviser in the Clinton White House.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to go in with the president-elect and hear what you guys have got to say,&#x201d; Podesta said.<br><br>McConnell paused awkwardly. He had received instructions from President Bush. &#x201c;As president,&#x201d; Bush had told McConnell, &#x201c;this is my decision. I forbid any information about our success and how this works&#x201d; except to the president-elect. McConnell knew Bush had never been comfortable using the terminology &#x201c;sources and methods.&#x201d; But what the president meant was that nothing should be disclosed that might identify human spies and new techniques developed to infiltrate and attack al Qaeda, fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and defend the nation.<br><br>&#x201c;John, sorry,&#x201d; McConnell said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to be able to accommodate, but I didn&#x2019;t make these rules.&#x201d; He related Bush&#x2019;s instructions&#x2014;only the president-elect and anyone designated to take a top national security cabinet post could attend. &#x201c;Neither of you are designated. So I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m not going to violate the president&#x2019;s direction.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I got it,&#x201d; Podesta said, barely concealing his irritation. Podesta had had all-source intelligence access before, as had Steinberg. He thought this was not helpful to Obama, who was largely unfamiliar with intelligence briefings.<br><br>Obama arrived still in full campaign mode with ready smiles and firm handshakes all around. He was buoyant in the afterglow of victory.<br><br>Two months earlier, after receiving a routine top secret briefing from McConnell on terrorism threats, Obama had half joked, &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;ve been worried about losing this election. After talking to you guys, I&#x2019;m worried about winning this election.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. President-elect, we need to see you for a second,&#x201d; Podesta said, steering him off to a private room. When Obama returned, his demeanor was different. He was more reserved, even aggravated. The transition from campaigning to governing&#x2014;with all its frustrations&#x2014;was delivering another surprise. His people, the inner circle from the campaign and the brain trust of Democrats he had carefully assembled to guide his transition, were being excluded. The first customer&#x2013;elect was going to have to go it alone.<br><br>McConnell and Morell sat down with Obama in a private, secure room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. It was an unusually small room in the center of the building where a bathroom might normally be located. Designed to prevent eavesdropping, the SCIF was windowless and confining, even claustrophobic.<br><br>At first, this would be something of a continuation and amplification of the earlier briefing McConnell had given candidate Obama. There were 161,000 American troops at war in Iraq and 38,000 in Afghanistan. Intelligence was making significant contributions to the war efforts. But the immediate threat to the United States came not from these war zones, but from Pakistan, an unstable country with a population of about 170 million, a 1,500-mile border with southern Afghanistan, and an arsenal of some 100 nuclear weapons.<br><br>Priority one for the DNI, and now Obama, had to be the ungoverned tribal regions along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border where Osama bin Laden, his al Qaeda network, and branches of the extremist insurgent Taliban had nested in 150 training camps and other facilities.<br><br>Combined, the seven regions forming Pakistan&#x2019;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) were about the size of New Jersey. The extremist groups and tribal chiefs ruled much of the FATA and had footholds in Pakistan&#x2019;s Northwest Frontier province.<br><br>In September 2006, Pakistan had signed a treaty ceding full control of the FATA&#x2019;s North Waziristan region to Taliban-linked tribal chiefs, creating a kind of Wild West for al Qaeda and the Taliban insurgents attacking the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.<br><br>In the earlier briefing, McConnell had laid out the problem in dealing with Pakistan. It was a dishonest partner of the U.S. in the Afghanistan War. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re living a lie,&#x201d; McConnell had said. In exchange for reimbursements of about $2 billion a year from the U.S., Pakistan&#x2019;s powerful military and its spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), helped the U.S. while giving clandestine aid, weapons and money to the Afghan Taliban. They had an &#x201c;office of hedging your bets,&#x201d; McConnell said.<br><br>Dealing with the ISI would break your heart if you did it long enough, McConnell had explained. It was as if there were six or seven different personalities within the ISI. The CIA exploited and bought some, but at least one section&#x2014;known as Directorate S&#x2014;financed and nurtured the Taliban and other terrorist groups. CIA payments might put parts of the ISI in America&#x2019;s pocket, McConnell had said, but the Pakistani spy agency could not or would not control its own people.<br><br>The Pakistani leadership believed the U.S. would eventually withdraw from the region, as it had toward the end of the Cold War once the occupying Soviet forces retreated from Afghanistan in 1989. Their paranoid mind-set was, in part, understandable. If America moved out again, India and Iran would fill the power vacuum inside Afghanistan. And most of all, Pakistan feared India, an avowed enemy for more than 60 years. As a growing economic and military powerhouse, India had numerous intelligence programs inside Afghanistan to spread its influence there. Pakistan worried more about being encircled by India than being undermined by extremists inside its borders.<br><br>The best way out of this would be for Obama to broker some kind of peace between India and Pakistan, the DNI had said. If Pakistan felt significantly more secure in its relations with India, it might stop playing its deadly game with the Taliban.<br><br>In his September overview, McConnell also discussed strikes by small unmanned aerial vehicles such as Predators that had sophisticated surveillance cameras and Hellfire missiles. The covert action program authorized by President Bush targeted al Qaeda leadership and other groups inside Pakistan. Although classified, the program had been widely reported in the Pakistani and American media.<br><br>Only four strikes had been launched in the first half of 2008, Obama had been told. The U.S. had uncovered evidence that the Pakistanis would delay planned strikes in order to warn al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, whose fighters would then disperse. In June 2008, McConnell had taken human and technical intelligence to President Bush showing multiple conversations between an ISI colonel and Siraj Haqqani, a guerrilla commander whose network was allied with the Afghan Taliban.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Bush had said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re going to stop playing the game. These sons of bitches are killing Americans. I&#x2019;ve had enough.&#x201d; He ordered stepped-up Predator drone strikes on al Qaeda leaders and specific camps, so-called infrastructure targets. It was like attacking an anthill&#x2014;the survivors would run away in the aftermath. These &#x201c;squirters&#x201d; were then tracked to the next hideout, helping to build the intelligence data on terrorist refuges.<br><br>Bush had directed that Pakistan receive &#x201c;concurrent notification&#x201d; of drone attacks, meaning they learned of a strike as it was underway or, just to be sure, a few minutes <i>after</i>. American drones now owned the skies above Pakistan.<br><br>In addition, McConnell had given President Bush intelligence showing that the Pakistani ISI had helped the Haqqani network attack the Indian embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 7, four months earlier. The U.S. had warned India, which had put its embassy in a defensive posture. But it was not enough. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 100 injured in a suicide bombing.<br><br>McConnell had then moved during the September briefing to one of the most pressing worries. Al Qaeda was recruiting people from the 35 countries who didn&#x2019;t need visas to enter the United States. It was paying them good money, bringing them into the ungoverned regions by the dozens, training them in all aspects of warfare&#x2014;explosives and chemical&#x2014;and trying to have them acquire biological weapons.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re a big open sieve,&#x201d; McConnell said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re trying to get people with passports that don&#x2019;t require a visa to get into the United States.&#x201d; Al Qaeda had not succeeded yet, but that was the big worry. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t find any cell in the United States, but we suspect there may be some.&#x201d;<br><br>That got Obama&#x2019;s full attention. Some of the 9/11 hijackers had operated for nearly 18 months in the United States before their attacks. As he had said at the end of that meeting, there were reasons to worry about winning the election.<br><br>The November 6 briefing to Obama picked up exactly where that earlier presentation had left off. McConnell could now provide him with a fuller description of how the intelligence community culled and collected information.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. President-elect, we can share anything with you,&#x201d; McConnell said in the soothing accent of his native South Carolina.<br><br>For example, the top secret code words for the Predator drone operations were SYLVAN-MAGNOLIA. The code words set up Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) to which only people with the highest-level security clearances and a need to know were granted access. The president-elect was now, of course, one of those people.<br><br>The U.S. had scored an extraordinary intelligence coup in the un-governed regions of Pakistan as the result of blending two intelligence cultures&#x2014;human sources and technical intelligence such as communications intercepts and satellite and drone imagery.<br><br>But, he said, the real breakthrough had been with human sources. This is what President Bush wanted to protect at all costs. The drones were basically flying high-resolution video cameras armed with missiles. The only meaningful way to point drones toward a target was to have spies on the ground telling the CIA where to look, hunt and kill. Without spies, the video feed from the Predator might as well be a blank television screen.<br><br>McConnell provided extensive details about these human sources, who had been developed in an expensive, high-risk program over five years. The spies were the real secrets that Obama would carry with him from that moment forward. They were the key, in some respects, to protecting the country.<br><br>President Bush had absolute views on protecting them. &#x201c;His instructions to us are no one except you or one of your designated cabinet officials can be provided the information,&#x201d; McConnell said. President Bush did not want any &#x201c;tourists,&#x201d; as he called them, and no &#x201c;professors&#x201d; who might be part of the Obama transition team but later reveal the spies in a speech, a book or a careless comment.<br><br>Obama indicated he understood.<br><br>The CIA is so guarded with human sources that each one has a randomly selected code name such as MOONRISE. If the source is productive and undertaking great risks, word might get around the agency. He&#x2019;s doing great, but when too many people know about him he is killed off. There is a burial ceremony, everybody&#x2019;s sad. MOONRISE paid the ultimate price, his CIA case officer would say. Except MOON-RISE is not actually dead. His code name has changed. And now the CIA has another source called SHOOTING STAR. Same guy, new name. MOONRISE is SHOOTING STAR. It&#x2019;s an elaborate and manipulative ruse in order to grant MOONRISE the ultimate protection&#x2014;death.<br><br>On the technical side, McConnell explained, the National Security Agency (NSA), which he had headed from 1992 to 1996, had developed a breakthrough eavesdropping capability. It had begun years before with a project code-named SHARKFINN that was designed to speed the acquisition, storage, dissemination and availability of intercepted communications, including cell phone calls and e-mails. The project advanced and was soon referred to as RT10, which increased the speed in real time to factors of up to 10 to the 10th power, or 10 billion times faster. It was now called RTRG&#x2014;Real Time, Regional Gateway. RTRG meant there was a way to capture all the data, store it, and make it instantly available to intelligence analysts and operators, allowing the U.S. to react quickly in response to the enemy.<br><br>In Afghanistan, the program code name was JESTER. Specialized units called JACKAL teams operated countrywide to monitor the insurgency.<br><br>&#x201c;They talk, we listen. They move, we observe. Given the opportunity, we react operationally,&#x201d; McConnell said.<br><br>The human and technical intelligence pointed with confidence, McConnell said, to the Quetta Shura Taliban as the central insurgent group in the Afghanistan War. This &#x201c;shura,&#x201d; an Arabic word meaning council, was headed by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader who had fled Afghanistan after the U.S. attack into his country after 9/11. There had been a $25 million reward on his head ever since.<br><br>Mullah Omar was in the Pakistani city of Quetta, just about 60 miles from the Afghan border in the province of Baluchistan. Unlike the vast desert of the FATA, Quetta had a population of almost 900,000, which made drone strikes virtually impossible.<br><br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the center of gravity,&#x201d; McConnell said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Obama asked, &#x201c;what are we doing about that?&#x201d;<br><br>Not that much, McConnell indicated.<br><br>The problem was sending American forces across the border into Pakistani cities where drones could not strike. Just two months earlier, on September 3, a day after McConnell had given candidate Obama his first briefing, President Bush authorized a cross-border operation into Pakistan. It was supposed to be a quiet, in-out Special Forces ground raid by about two dozen Navy SEALs on a house believed to be used by al Qaeda in the town of Angor Adda in the FATA. The plan was for the SEALs to seize al Qaeda&#x2019;s documents and computers, their &#x201c;stuff,&#x201d; as McConnell called it.<br><br>But in that part of the world, people often ran toward automatic weapons fire and explosions&#x2014;instead of away from the danger&#x2014;to see what was happening, McConnell explained. Civilians were killed in the raid, causing all hell to break loose in the Pakistani press.<br><br>The raid had been poorly planned and coordinated, McConnell ...</p><h2>blanc et noir: Takeshi Obata Illustrations</h2><p>A limited edition release of Takeshi Obata&#x2019;s high-end full-color artbook that contains his illustrations from <i>Death Note</i>.<br> <br>Collects bestselling artist Takeshi Obata&#x2019;s work from 2001-2006, which contains illustrations from popular series <i>Death Note</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Hikaru no Go</i>.

S. Pritchett. A late masterpiece in Balzac&#39;s &#34;La Comedie Humaine, Cousin Bette is the story of a Vosges peasant who rebels against her scornful upper-class relatives, skillfully turning their selfish obsessions against them. The novel exemplifies what Henry James described as Balzac&#39;s &#34;huge, all-compassing, all-desiring, all-devouring love of reality.&#34;&#x201c;Raine&#x2019;s translations restore Balzac to his passionate and efficient outrage upon the expectations of fiction.

The young woman stood with her arms folded at her waist and hands tucked into wide sleeves, all in white, from a severe, unadorned bonnet tied tightly beneath her chin to the wide habit that fell like a tent to the floor. No more than twenty-three by Anna&#x2019;s estimation, hardly five feet tall and most of that composed of sharp corners: a chin that came to a point and a nose and cheekbones to match, elbows poking out at noncongruent angles. Anna was put in mind of a nervous and underfed chicken wrapped up in a napkin.</p><p>&#x201c;Sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Augustin,&#x201d; she supplied. She had a clear voice, all polite good manners, and still there was nothing timid in her manner.</p><p>Anna said, &#x201c;Good morning. How can I help you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was sent to fetch the other Dr. Savard, but it seems she&#x2019;s not in. Her note said to wait for you.&#x201d;</p><p>People who came so early to the house were almost always looking for Anna&#x2019;s cousin Sophie, who worked among the poor women and children of the city. For a scant moment Anna thought of lying, but she had never learned the art, and there was the promise she made to Sophie.</p><p>&#x201c;The other Dr. Savard is attending a birth,&#x201d; Anna said. &#x201c;She told me you might come and I agreed to take her place.&#x201d;</p><p>The pale forehead creased and then, reluctantly, smoothed. Clearly she had strong opinions, but had been schooled to keep them to herself. She said, &#x201c;Shall we go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Anna said. &#x201c;But I have to write a note first to say I won&#x2019;t be in this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;While you do that,&#x201d; said Mrs. Lee, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to feed Sister Mary Augustin. If I don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll have to explain myself to Father Graves in confession.&#x201d; She took in the nun&#x2019;s hesitance but pointed at a chair. &#x201c;I know that you wouldn&#x2019;t want to lead me astray. So sit.&#x201d;</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, finally ready to go, Mrs. Lee took the note to be delivered to the hospital and delivered a statement in return.</p><p>&#x201c;Your cousin Margaret wanted to talk to you about your costume for that ball.&#x201d; She said <i>that ball</i> as she would have said <i>the fires of hell</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Margaret should talk to Aunt Quinlan if she&#x2019;s worried. She&#x2019;s the one who made all the arrangements for my costume.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Lee&#x2019;s small round face could produce a tremendous depth and variety of wrinkles when she was irritated, as she was now. &#x201c;And what is a proper young lady, almost thirty might I add&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not yet twenty-eight, and well you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;an educated woman of good family, an unmarried lady, a physician and surgeon, what business do you have at a ball on Easter Monday&#x2014;Easter Monday!&#x2014;given by that greedy, vainglorious Vanderbilt woman? Why&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Lee.&#x201d; Anna interrupted in her sternest tone, tempering it with a smile. &#x201c;I made Cap a promise. Would you want me to disappoint Cap?&#x201d;</p><p>All the irritation crackling in the air was gone, just that simply. Mrs. Lee loved Cap; everybody did. Muttering, she marched back to the stove.</p><p>&#x201c;You and your auntie with your heads together,&#x201d; Anna heard her say. &#x201c;Only the good Lord knows what will come of that. And on Easter Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>ANNA SET OFF at a brisk pace along Washington Square Park and then, realizing that Sister Mary Augustin was almost running to keep up, stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t slow down or we&#x2019;ll miss the ferry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can run all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be there with five minutes to spare, even at this pace.&#x201d;</p><p>A flicker of doubt chased across the angular features. In the sunlight her complexion was like buttermilk, with a scattering of freckles and eyebrows the deep red-brown of chestnuts. Anna tried to remember if she had ever seen nuns wearing bonnets before, and then let the question go.</p><p>Sister Mary Augustin was saying, &#x201c;And may I ask how you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I grew up here, and I walk almost everywhere. And I have a clock in my head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A clock,&#x201d; Sister Mary Augustin echoed.</p><p>&#x201c;A talent for time,&#x201d; Anna said. &#x201c;The ability to keep time without a timepiece. It&#x2019;s a skill a surgeon must develop, you see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Surgeon?&#x201d; The little nun looked both confused and horrified, as if Anna had claimed to be a bishop. &#x201c;But I thought&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t your cousin&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The other Dr. Savard specializes in obstetrics and pediatrics. I&#x2019;m primarily a surgeon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But who would&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped herself and two spots of red rose in her cheeks. She was pretty, Anna noted, when she forgot to be solemn. She wondered how much information she could supply without causing Sister Mary Augustin to fall down in a faint.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Women generally prefer a woman, physician or midwife or surgeon, when they are very ill or in labor. If they have a choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Sister Mary Augustin said. &#x201c;You operate on women only. That makes more sense.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna said, &#x201c;I am qualified to operate on anyone, but I am on the staff at the New Amsterdam Charity Hospital. Just as the other Dr. Savard, the one you hoped to find, is on staff at the Infant and Children&#x2019;s Hospital and the Colored Hospital. And yes technically, I am not allowed to operate on men. Or so says the law.&#x201d;</p><p>After a moment Sister Mary Augustin said, &#x201c;I suppose my training is quite narrow. I&#x2019;ve never even seen a surgery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Anna said. &#x201c;You must come by and observe. And we are always in need of trained nurses, if you should ever rethink your&#x201d;&#x2014;she paused&#x2014;&#x201c;calling.&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment Mary Augustin was struck speechless by such a shocking suggestion. Sister Ignatia would be outraged, as Mary Augustin herself should be outraged, but instead she was struggling with a sudden blossoming of curiosity. She had been in this terrifying, exciting city for less than a year; during all that time questions had piled on top of questions, none of which she could ask.</p><p>But here was someone who would not scowl at her if she put one of those questions into words. Someone who would likely even answer. She could ask this Dr. Savard what kind of medicine obstetrics might be, and how it was that a woman could become not just a physician but a surgeon. Hot on the heels of this came the realization that Sister Ignatia was right, it was a mistake to let curiosity run riot. It would drag a person to places best left unexplored.</p><p>And she still could not stop watching this very odd and unsettling woman doctor&#x2014;surgeon, she corrected herself&#x2014;from the corner of her eye.</p><p>It seemed to Mary Augustin at first that Dr. Savard was wearing makeup, and then realized that it was simply vivid coloring that rose and retreated in her cheeks as they walked into the wind. Her mouth was a deep shade of pink, but the full lips were also a little chapped. She wore her dark hair smoothed back and twisted into a coil underneath her very practical hat, without the stylish bangs that most young ladies wore these days. As Mary Augustin&#x2014;Elise Mercier, as she still thought of herself and always would&#x2014;would wear, were such a vanity allowed. She resisted the urge to touch the faint pox scars on her forehead.</p><p>With her strong features and high coloring, few would call Dr. Savard pretty, but it was an interesting face with intelligent eyes. And she was clearly well-to-do; the neighborhood, the four-story house of a light-colored stone, the heavy oaken front door with carved lilies and cherubs, lace at the windows, all spoke to that. But both of the Savard cousins had given up a life of leisure for medicine.</p><p>Sister Ignatia would tell her to turn her attention elsewhere. The rosary, for example, which swung at her waist with each step she took. If she could get up the nerve, the first question she would ask the lady doctor would have to do with her clothes.</p><p>Dr. Savard wore garments of the very finest materials, beautifully tailored but without ornament and as austere as any nun&#x2019;s habit. Her hat was dark blue lined in gray; a matching, widely cut coat fell in folds straight from a high yoke below her shoulder blades to the top of sturdy boots. Her leather gloves were of a deep glossy black with small brass buttons at the wrist. She carried a bulky leather bag as all doctors did, and she let it swing a little at her side as she walked.</p><p>There was an occasional glimpse of skirts swirling back and forth with every step she took, very oddly. That Dr. Savard was not wearing a bustle was not such a surprise&#x2014;few women who worked with the sick bothered with fashions. But the way the skirt moved puzzled her. Mary Augustin&#x2019;s own skirts swung wide with every step, so that the toes of her boots peeked out, first one and then the other. Dr. Savard was walking just as fast, but her skirts seemed to restrain themselves to a much smaller arc. With a start she realized that the lady doctor was wearing a split skirt, like a man&#x2019;s trousers or sleeves for the legs. Widely cut so that she could walk without constriction, but trousers, without a doubt.</p><p>In the midst of Lent Father Corcoran had given a thunderous sermon on the Rational Dress Society, which he took as proof of the continuing decline of the weaker sex. He predicted physical illness, infertility, and damnation. To her surprise and unease, Mary Augustin saw that such skirts were not immodest, no matter what Father Corcoran or His Holiness Pope Leo himself might say. They looked, she could admit to herself at least, both modest and comfortable. Something so shocking and interesting and once again, she would have to keep her questions to herself.</p><p>As they walked Dr. Savard greeted almost everyone by name: the street sweeper and the baker&#x2019;s delivery boy, a young girl minding a sleeping baby swaddled in quilts and tucked into a crate, a pair of laundry women arguing in Gaelic. She called out to a very grubby newsboy to ask after his mother and got a smile in return, everything taciturn chased away in that moment Dr. Savard spoke to him.</p><p>In Washington Square the trees were reaching toward spring, fat buds putting out the first pale green to shimmer in the sun. The city was full of such contrasts: beautiful homes on wide streets lined with linden and elm and plane trees, and tenements so filthy and overcrowded that the stench filled the throat with bile. Little boys dressed in velvet toddled along under the watchful eye of nannies in spotless aprons, and a half-naked child crouched down to watch maggots roiling in the open belly of a dead cat.</p><p>Every day Mary Augustin asked herself what she had imagined when she was first sent to this great noisy city. In theory she had understood what it meant to take in the poorest and most desperate; she knew that many of the infants would be sick unto death and few would survive their first year. But she had never understood what it meant to be truly poor before she came to this place. Every day she was frightened, overwhelmed, and at the same time consumed by curiosity, needing to understand things that could not be explained.</p><p>She cast a glance at Dr. Savard and wondered if it would be a very terrible sin to talk to her, and what penance such an act of defiance would earn once she put it into words in the confessional.</p><p><i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I asked unseemly questions of a well-bred, overeducated lady in split skirts. And I listened to the answers.</i></p><p>At the corner of Fifth Avenue they came to an abrupt halt while oxen pulled two huge drays through the intersection. Florid red lettering on the first one declared that the profusion of potted trees&#x2014;some twice Mary Augustin&#x2019;s own height, at least&#x2014;came from LeMoult&#x2019;s Conservatory. The second dray had a lighter load: buckets and buckets of flowers, gorgeous deep colors and lighter spring shades. On the side of this wagon was a smaller sign:</p><p>MEZZANOTTE BROTHERS <br>GREENWOOD, N.J.</p><p>Mary Augustin couldn&#x2019;t help staring, but then she was not the only one.</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder what that&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; she asked in a voice low enough to be ignored. Dr. Savard looked at her and lifted a shoulder. &#x201c;The Vanderbilts,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And their costume ball.&#x201d;</p><p>She had ventured a question and got an answer, but that only brought a hundred more questions to mind. If this went on much longer, Mary Augustin told herself, her brain would be riddled with question marks, hundreds of little hooks set so deep they&#x2019;d never let go.</p></p><h2>James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon</h2><p>James Tiptree, Jr. burst onto the science fiction scene in the 1970s with a series of hardedged, provocative short stories. Hailed as a brilliant masculine writer with a deep sympathy for his famale character, he penned such classics as <i>Houston, Houston, Do You Read?</i>and <i>The Women Men Don't See. </i>For years he corresponded with Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison,Ursula Le Guin. No one knew his true identity. Then the cover was blown on his alter ego: A sixty-one-year old woman named Alice Sheldon. As a child, she explored Africa with her mother. Later, made into a debutante, she eloped with one of the guests at the party. She was an artist, a chicken farmer, aWorld War II intelligence officer, a CIA agent, an experimental psychologist. Devoted to her second husband, she struggled with her feelings for women. In 1987, her suicide shocked friends and fans. The James Tiptree, Jr.Award was created to honor science fiction or fantasy that explores our understanding of gender. This fascinating biography, ten years in the making, is based on extensive research, exclusive interviews, and full access to Alice Sheldon's papers</p><p>JULIE PHILLIPS is a journalist who has written on books, film, feminism, and cultural politics for <i>Newsday, Interview, Mademoiselle, </i>and for <i>Ms. </i>and <i>The Village Voice</i>Introduction: Who Is Tiptree, What Is He?<br><br>No one [...] has, to my knowledge, ever met Tiptree, ever seen him, ever talked with him on the phone.

He writes, "At last I have what every child wants, a real secret life. Not an official secret, not a Q-clearance polygraph-enforced bite-the-capsule-when-they-get-you secret, nobody else's damn secret but MINE."<br><br>James Tiptree, Jr., appeared on the science fiction scene in the late 1960s, writing fast-paced, action-filled stories about rocket ships, alien sex, and intergalactic bureaucratic anxiety. He was a brilliant and original talent, with a voice like no one else's: knowing, intense, utterly convinced of its authority and the urgency of its message. No one had ever seen or spoken to the owner of this voice. He wrote letters, warm, frank, funny letters, to other writers, editors, and science fiction fans. His correspondence was intimate and revealing, yet even his closest friends knew little more about "Tip" than his address: a post office box in McLean, Virginia.<br><br>He was rumored to be a government official or secret agent. He did seem to know a lot about spooks around the water cooler: his characters worked in "an unimportant bit of C.I.A." or remarked, "Paranoia hasn't been useful in my business for years, but the habit is hard to break." He had opinions about fishing, duck hunting, and politics. He was courtly and flirtatious with women. When one of his friends, the writer Robert Silverberg, sent him a letter on his wife's stationary, Tip answered that he had "shaved and applied lotion" before reading on. Silverberg pictured Tip as "a man of 50 or 55, I guess, possibly unmarried, fond of outdoor life, restless in his everyday existence, a man who has seen much of the world and understands it well." Men looked up to him. His women friends fell in love.<br><br>The stories that came out of PO Box 315 became more and more brilliant and disturbing. It wasn't the sex, and it wasn't the death, but it was the combination of the two. His stories read like urgent messages from some haunted house on the corner of Eros and Mortality. Humans meet aliens---and abandon their very souls for a chance to sleep with them. A man in love with the Earth kills off the human race, including himself, to save her. A mission to the stars finds an alien egg for which the colonists themselves turn out to be the sperm.<br><br>Like Philip K. Dick, Tiptree used science fiction to talk about the importance of empathy and explore what it means to be human---though he was less likely than Dick to question reality. Reality is there; the human project is to learn to see it, or die. Or learn to see ourselves: the reality of human flesh and emotions was what terrified, and fascinated, Tiptree. Can the body be trusted? Will it betray us? What does it want? Can we get rid of it?<br><br>This masculine writer, who let his readers in on the technology of space flight and the inner workings of government, also showed a surprising sympathy toward his female characters. He wrote about women's alienation in a world of men, and was held up as an example of a male feminist, a man who understood. Still, his stories were so full of action, philosophy, and desire for women that everyone knew they were dealing with a man. In 1975, in an introduction to a book of Tiptree's short stories, Robert Silverberg wrote of his friend, "It has been suggested that Tiptree is female, a theory that I find absurd, for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree's writing."<br><br>He likened Tiptree's "lean, muscular, supple" stories to Hemingway's:<br><br>Hemingway was a deeper and trickier writer than he pretended to be; so too with Tiptree, who conceals behind an aw-shucks artlessness an astonishing skill for shaping scenes and misdirecting readers into unexpected abysses of experience. And there is, too, that prevailing masculinity about both of them---that preoccupation with questions of courage, with absolute values, with the mysteries and passions of life and death as revealed by extreme physical tests, by pain and suffering and loss.<br><br>In the same year, another of Tiptree's letter-friends, the feminist science fiction writer Joanna Russ, wrote him that a professor at a party had "asked me if you were a woman (!) by which I gather he can't recognize a female point of view if it bites him." When Tiptree participated in a written symposium on "Women in Science Fiction" as a token "sensitive man," Russ told him he had ideas "no woman could even think, or understand, let alone assent to."<br><br>By then Tiptree had introduced a prot�g�e, Raccoona Sheldon, who seemed strongly influenced by Tiptree's style. No one, not even herself, had opinions about Raccoona's sex: she was a former schoolteacher who published little and wrote, "As for me, really the less said the better."<br><br>Tiptree did reveal a few facts about himself. He had been born in Chicago. His parents had been African explorers and his mother a writer. He had spent part of his childhood in colonial Africa, and the Second World War "in a Pentagon sub-basement." He was reluctant to reveal his true identity because he couldn't have the people around him know he was writing science fiction, and because he liked his secret life.<br><br>Then in late 1976, Tiptree told a few friends that his elderly mother had died. More than one of Tip's correspondents checked the Chicago papers and found an obituary for Mary Hastings Bradley, novelist, travel writer, and African explorer. Under "survivors" was listed her only child: Alice Bradley (Mrs. Huntington) Sheldon.<br><br>Ten years later, shortly before her death by suicide, Alli Sheldon wrote, "My secret world had been invaded and the attractive figure of Tiptree---he did strike several people as attractive---was revealed as nothing but an old lady in Virginia."<br><br><i>Alice Hastings Bradley Davey Sheldon, 1915--1987<br></i><br>As it turned out, the sixty-one-year-old Alice Sheldon, known as Alli, was just as attractive a figure as Tiptree had ever been, opinionated and theatrical, with a past that she revealed, bit by bit, in tantalizing anecdotes. The few friends she allowed into the home in McLean that she shared with her husband, Huntington "Ting" Sheldon, were fascinated by this eloquent storyteller. The writer Gardner Dozois called her "one of the most fascinating conversationalists I've ever met, brilliant, theatrical, far-ranging, strikingly perceptive." David Hartwell, her editor, said "Alli was electrifying, [...] enchanting both in person and in her fiction."<br><br>By the time she started writing science fiction she had already been a painter and an airforce intelligence officer. She had eloped with the "beautiful alcoholic poet" who had been seated on her left at her debut. She had worked for the CIA. She had earned a Ph.D. in experimental psychology. She had published a story in the <i>New Yorker</i>. She had begun and thrown out essays, scientific works, and novels.<br><br>She was born in 1915 as Alice Hastings Bradley, the cute, blue-eyed only child of two extraordinary parents. Her father, Herbert Bradley, was a lawyer who led three expeditions into unmapped Central Africa. Her mother, Mary Hastings Bradley, was a highly successful author of travel books and popular fiction. Both adult Bradleys were charismatic, energetic, public people whose adventures gave the family an exotic air.<br><br>Mary Bradley was an enormous presence in Alli's life: magnetic, generous, theatrical, extremely long-lived. Tiptree described his mother as<br><br>a kind of explorer-heroine, highly literate (Oxford &amp; Heidelberg), yet very feminine whatever that is. You help her through doors---and then find out she can hike 45 miles up a mountain carrying her rifle and yours. And repeat next day. And joke. And dazzling looks [...] I am still approached by doddering wrecks, extinguished Scandinavian savants or what have you who want to tell me about Mother as a young woman.<br><br>Alli called her<br><br>a dazzling and formidable little person, a "queen bee" with two adoring males in addition to her husband. (In our Victorian culture they were Father's best friends.) She was gifted, beautiful, emotional, accomplished; a linguist, writer, spell-binding conversationalist---and a superb shot and brave endurer of considerable real hardships. [...] She didn't provide a model for me, she provided an impossibility.<br><br>Mary encouraged her daughter, first as an artist and then as a writer. But what Alli needed to say was not within the scope even of Mary's wide world, and what she did not learn from Mary's example was that women could say anything. She learned that women had to be very careful in order to speak at all.<br><br>Besides, Mary took up a great deal of emotional and creative space, writing her daughter's story, literally, in two children's books about the Bradleys' African travels. It took a radical subterfuge---taking on a new name, pretending to be a man, turning into a new person---for Alli to get that story back, to become someone else besides her mother's daughter.<br><br>Tiptree wasn't only a trick for saying things Alli couldn't. Like all interesting people, Alli had many sides or selves, and Tiptree gave her more room to be those selves: worldly, analytical, independent, bloodthirsty, and funny. He gave her space to play, make jokes, or, on a bad day, annihilate the human race. He gave her space to love women (though not always to like them). Sometimes he said things she didn't have words for, in the days when no one wrote honestly about women's experience. Many artists feel they have another persona who does their work for them, a secret self very much unlike the "me" of their daily interactions. Tiptree was that person for Alli: a writer who (he once said) longed to stop sweating over words and drafts and instead "storm naked with hard-on waving thru the world spouting whatever comes."<br><br>Tiptree helped Alli to write partly because he wrote science fiction. "Literature," with its famous injunction to "write what you know," cannot always help us discover what we don't know. Science fiction gave Alli a language for writing around the boundaries, for imagining what cannot yet be said. It has been seen as a masculine genre. And yet, with its metaphors for alienation and otherness, its unruly imagination, and its power to predict change, it is highly suited to talking about women's experience.<br><br>Alli chose her male pseudonym on a whim, in a supermarket, where a jar of Tiptree jam caught Alli's eye. She was sending out some science fiction stories as a joke, and she wanted a name "editors wouldn't remember rejecting." But the male name turned out to have many uses. It made her feel taken seriously when she wrote about what she knew: guns, hunting, politics, war. It let her write the way she wanted to write, with an urgency that was hers. It gave her enough distance and control to speak honestly about herself.<br><br>In 1931, when Alice Bradley was fifteen, Virginia Woolf wrote "Professions for Women," with its famous image of the imagination diving deep into the stream and the woman writer forced to pull it back. In one of Woolf's drafts, the writer explains to her imagination, "I cannot make use of what you tell me---about womens bodies for instance---their passions---and so on, because the conventions are still very strong. If I were to overcome the conventions I should need the courage of a hero [...] I doubt that a writer can be a hero. I doubt that a hero can be a writer." Alice longed to be a genius, an artist who spoke the truth about her experience. But she didn't have the words for that experience, or the rare courage to become a literary heroine. Instead, late in life, she became one of our greatest literary tricksters.<br><br>Tiptree never pretended to be a man in person. Yet Tiptree's appropriation of the male mind is even more exciting. It's a much deeper challenge to the established narrative order, and promises a greater freedom. It questions all our assumptions about writing and gender. It changes how we look at our male writer heroes. As science historian Donna Haraway has suggested, Tiptree takes the figure of the Great White Hunter and reconfigures it for a postcolonial, postgender world. And it speaks, in a way no other writer's life has, to the ongoing problem of writing as a woman. Which is not to say that Alice wrote only about or for women. She wanted to lose her gender partly because, like Woolf, she didn't want to write for half the world.<br><br>She couldn't always imagine her way out of the problems she raised. Tiptree's stories most often end in death---for the protagonist, the crew, the colony, or the planet. In the same way, Alli put an end to her own story. She and her husband Ting agreed to commit suicide together when they became too old to go on. On May 19, 1987, when she was seventy-one and Ting eighty-four, she shot him and then herself.<br><br>Since her death, her work has gone on finding new audiences and influencing new writers, from cyberpunk authors like William Gibson to those who imagine the future of gender and sexuality. Tiptree now stands alongside Philip K. Dick and Ursula K. Le Guin as one of the twentieth century's most important and exciting writers of fantastic literature in America. While new generations of readers are drawn to her prescient work, her passionate life and tragic death have much to tell us about what it means to write---and to be human. And her performance as Tiptree, with its reversal of everything we expect about men and women writers, may be her greatest achievement, her greatest influence of all.<br><br><i>Names<br></i><br>Certainly let us be on first names; mine is Alli. ("Alice" carries joyless connotations of "Alice, eat your spinach." "Alice, go to bed." [...])<br>---<i>Alli Sheldon<br></i><br>Alice Sheldon disliked her first name, which she felt did not belong to her. "'Alice,' it was made clear to me early, belonged to my mother, who chose it because it had no nickname. How cruel can you get, unintentionally---I hope? But one's nicknames---they are one's own," she wrote Joanna Russ. She herself was an "inveterate nicknamer" who loved playing with names and was thrilled when her mother-in-law shortened her name to "Alli." She gave her own pseudonyms nicknames: "Tip" for Tiptree, and "Raccoona" for a woman writer with a mask.

He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world.

In a seamless delivery, narrator Raymond Todd portrays Paul&#39;s journey to Damascus, as described by Swindoll, during which he is blinded and then experiences the restoration of his eyesight by God. Then, as an example of solitude, Swindoll recounts the story of the movie CAST AWAY, about a FedEx employee who is stranded on a deserted island for four years. With light enunciation, Todd describes how, like Paul, the executive comes to surrender his pride and desire for prestige when he realizes that being on top will result in a loneliness and isolation similar to what he is experiencing as a castaway. The story of Paul&#39;s journey motivates self-examination.

The usual fantasy suspects-gnomes, trolls, elves, flying horses, unicorns, giants-crowd the pages, but the author does at times rise above cliche, and a few characters do achieve some complexity. Obould actually speaks of economics, while an elf, Innovindel, having lost her mate in battle, talks pensively of the centuries of her life, in contrast to the paltry few years of human life. This difference is significant to Drizzt, because Catti-brie is only human.

Hardcover with dust jacket, 332 pages, published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company.</p><p>Richard Dawkins is not a shy man. Edward Larson's research shows that most scientists today are not formally religious, but Dawkins is an in-your-face atheist in the witty British style: <p> </p> <blockquote> I want to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view happens to be true, but that it is the only known theory that could, in principle, solve the mystery of our existence. </blockquote> <p> The title of this 1986 work, Dawkins's second book, refers to the Rev. William Paley's 1802 work, <i>Natural Theology</i>, which argued that just as finding a watch would lead you to conclude that a watchmaker must exist, the complexity of living organisms proves that a Creator exists. Not so, says Dawkins: "All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics, albeit deployed in a very special way... it is the <i>blind</i> watchmaker."</p> <p> Dawkins is a hard-core scientist: he doesn't just tell you what is so, he shows you how to find out for yourself. For this book, he wrote <i>Biomorph</i>, one of the first artificial life programs. You can check Dawkins's results on your own Mac or PC.</p>The watchmaker belongs to the eighteenth-century theologian William Paley, who made one of the most famous creationist arguments: Just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed. It was Charles Darwin&#39;s brilliant discovery that put the lie to these arguments. But only Richard Dawkins could have written this eloquent riposte to the creationists. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process that Darwin discovered - has no purpose in mind. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker. Acclaimed as perhaps the most influential work on evolution written in this century, The Blind Watchmaker offers an engaging and accessible introduction to one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.</p><h2>The Dog of the South (1st Edition)</h2><p>When his wife, Norma, runs off with her lover, taking with her Ray&#39;s credit cards and his Ford Torino, Ray sets off in pursuit, journeying from Arkansas through Texas and Mexico to a remote plantation in Honduras</p><p>Charles Portis may be the sneakiest comedian in American letters, not to mention one of the funniest. And there's no better specimen of his double-edged art than <i>The Dog of the South</i>, which Overlook Press has recently rescued from a long, cruel, out-of-print limbo. As usual, the narrator is a down-at-the-heels Southerner with an eye for the homely detail and a mission to accomplish. What Ray Midge means to do is track down his significant other: "My wife Norma had run off with Guy Dupree and I was waiting around for the credit card billings to come in so I could see where they had gone." In another author's hands, this opening sentence might lead straight to a bloody, <i>noir</i>-ish denouement. Here it's merely the excuse for a meandering, semi-pointless quest, during which the fussbudget protagonist is assailed by tropical storms, grifters, hippies, car trouble, and even an assortment of airborne trash: "I had to keep the Buick speed below what I took to be about sixty because at that point the wind came up through the floor hole in such a way that the Heath wrappers were suspended behind my head in a noisy brown vortex."<p> Hapless, rhetorically challenged Ray Midge would more than fulfill any novel's quota for comic creation. But Portis pairs him with another indelible nutter, Dr. Reo Symes. A font of dubious financial schemes, Symes attaches himself to Ray like a peevish, passive-aggressive Pancho Sanza, and his non-sequitur-studded riffs must be heard to be believed: </p><blockquote> I always tried to help Leon and you see the thanks I got. I hired him to drive for me right after his rat died. He was with the Murrell Brothers Shows at that time, exhibiting a fifty-pound rat from the sewers of Paris, France. Of course it didn't really weigh fifty pounds and it wasn't your true rat and it wasn't from Paris, France, either. It was some kind of animal from South America. Anyway, the thing died and I hired Leon to drive for me. I was selling birthstone rings and vibrating jowl straps from door to door and he would let me out at one end of the block and wait on me at the other end. </blockquote> The vibrating jowl straps are the kicker here, of course. But it's the overall futility of the enterprise that gives Symes his comic potency, and makes him Ray's natural companion in arms. Neither of these guys is going to accomplish <i>anything</i>: they're Beckett clowns in Sansabelt trousers, too enervated by the heat even to agonize. Still, you won't find a more delicious (or less reliable) narrator in contemporary fiction, and Charles Portis's genius for inventing all-American eccentrics is anything but futile. <i>--James Marcus</i>Charles Portis lives in Arkansas, where he was born and educated. He served in the Marine Corps during the Korean War, was the London bureau chief of the New York Herald-Tribune, and was a writer for The New Yorker.</p><h2>Thinking for a Change: 11 Ways Highly Successful People Approach Life and Work</h2><p>At the heart of John C.

Refreshingly nondoctrinaire, Barr argues for the "American" identity of the cuisine developed by waves of immigrants from Southern Italy, whose novel relative prosperity allowed them to refurbish traditional recipes with previously luxurious ingredients ("Poor families in Sicily might see the butcher only twice a year," she reminds us). Her recipes, all standouts, all lucidly explained, include a Calabrian eggplant salad seasoned with fresh mint; a parsley pizza; "eggs in purgatory" ("not so bad, that is, so hot, as being 'allastet diavolo' "); and a paprika sauce for pasta that demonstrates the synthesis of New World flavors. There are also obligatory ragus, meat rolls, lasagnas. Her frequent and repetitious interpolations of "food memories" from a cast of Italo-Americans distract, nonetheless, from the excellence of Barr's work; they skirt history and settle, mostly, for sentiment. Illustrations not seen by PW. BOMC/HomeStyle alternate. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.The fourth title in this series is from a food writer/teacher who grew up in Providence's Little Italy. Barr is eager to preserve the authentic recipes the Italian immigrants brought with them, as well as the variations they adopted in this country: Linguine with Onions, Chicken with Green Olives. Her recipe headnotes are informative, and there are sidebars on ingredients, cultural history, and techniques. Nostalgic "memories" from other Italian-Americans are interspersed throughout.

Leaving would imply suitcases and empty drawers, and late birthday cards with ten-dollar bills stuffed inside. Leaving would imply he was unhappy with Mom and me, or that he found a new love elsewhere. None of that was true. He also did not die, because we would've heard about it. There was no car crash, no body, no police mingling about the scene of a brutal murder. It all happened very quietly.<br><br>On my sixth birthday, my father took me to the park, one of my favorite places to go at that time. It was a lonely little park in the middle of nowhere, with a running trail and a misty green pond surrounded by pine trees. We were at the edge of the pond, feeding the ducks, when I heard the jingle of an ice cream truck in the parking lot over the hill. When I begged my dad to get me a Creamsicle, he laughed, handed me a few bills, and sent me after the truck.<br><br>That was the last time I saw him.<br><br>Later, when the police searched the area, they discovered his shoes at the edge of the water, but nothing else. They sent divers into the pond, but it was barely ten feet down, and they found nothing but branches and mud at the bottom. My father had disappeared without a trace.<br><br>For months afterward, I had a recurring nightmare about standing at the top of that hill, looking down and seeing my father walk into the pond. As the water closed over his head, I could hear the ice cream truck singing in the background, a slow, eerie song with words I could almost understand. Every time I tried to listen to them, however, I'd wake up.<br><br>Not long after my father's disappearance, Mom moved us far away, to a tiny little hick town in the middle of the Louisiana bayou. Mom said she wanted to "start over," but I always knew, deep down, that she was running from something.<br><br>It would be another ten years before I discovered what.<br><br>My name is M.eghan Chase.<br><br>In less than twenty-four hours, I'll be sixteen years old.<br><br>Sweet sixteen. It has a magical ring to it. Sixteen is supposed to be the age when girls become princesses and fall in love and go to dances and proms and such. Countless stories, songs, and poems have been written about this wonderful age, when a girl finds true love and the stars shine for her and the handsome prince carries her off into the sunset.<br><br>I didn't think it would be that way for me.<br><br>The morning before my birthday, I woke up, showered, and rummaged through my dresser for something to wear. Normally, I'd just grab whatever clean-ish thing is on the floor, but today was special. Today was the day Scott Waldron would finally notice me. I wanted to look perfect. Of course, my wardrobe is sadly lacking in the popular-attire department. While other girls spend hours in front of their closets crying,<br><br>"What should I wear?" my drawers basically hold three things: clothes from Goodwill, hand-me-downs, and overalls.<br><br><em>I wish we weren't so poor. I know pig farming isn't the most glamorous of jobs, but you'd think Mom could afford to buy me at least one pair of nice jeans. </em>I glared at my scanty wardrobe in disgust. <em>Oh, well, I guess Scott will have to be wowed with my natural grace and charm, if I don't make an idiot of myself in front of him.</em><br><br>I finally slipped into cargo pants, a neutral green T-shirt, and my only pair of ratty sneakers, before dragging a brush through my white-blond hair. My hair is straight and very fine, and was doing that stupid floating thing again, where it looked like I'd jammed my finger up an electrical outlet. Yanking it into a ponytail, I went downstairs.<br><br>Luke, my stepfather, sat at the table, drinking coffee and leafing through the town's tiny newspaper, which reads more like our high school gossip column than a real news source. "Five-legged calf born on Patterson's farm," the front page screamed; you get the idea. Ethan, my four-year-old half brother, sat on his father's lap, eating a Pop-Tart and getting crumbs all over Luke's overalls. He clutched Floppy, his favorite stuffed rabbit, in one arm and occasionally tried to feed it his breakfast; the rabbit's face was full of crumbs and fruit filling.<br><br>Ethan is a good kid. He has his father's curly brown hair, but like me, inherited Mom's big blue eyes. He's the type of kid old ladies stop to coo at, and total strangers smile and wave at him from across the street. Mom and Luke dote on their baby, but it doesn't seem to spoil him, thank goodness.<br><br>"Where's Mom?" I asked as I entered the kitchen. Opening the cabinet doors, I scoured the boxes of cereal for the one I liked, wondering if Mom remembered to pick it up. Of course she hadn't. Nothing but fiber squares and disgusting marshmallow cereals for Ethan. Was it so hard to remember Cheerios?<br><br>Luke ignored me and sipped his coffee. Ethan chewed his Pop-Tart and sneezed on his father's arm. I slammed the cabinet doors with a satisfying bang.<br><br>"Where's Mom?" I asked, a bit louder this time. Luke jerked his head up and finally looked at me. His lazy brown eyes, like those of a cow, registered mild surprise.<br><br>"Oh, hello, Meg," he said calmly. "I didn't hear you come in. What did you say?"<br><br>I sighed and repeated my question for the third time.<br><br>"She had a meeting with some of the ladies at church," Luke murmured, turning back to his paper. "She won't be back for a few hours, so you'll have to take the bus."<br><br>I always took the bus. I just wanted to remind Mom that she was supposed to take me to get a learner's permit this weekend. With Luke, it was hopeless. I could tell him something fourteen different times, and he'd forget it the moment I left the room. It wasn't that Luke was mean or malicious, or even stupid. He adored Ethan, and Mom seemed truly happy with him. But, every time I spoke to my stepdad, he would look at me with genuine surprise, as if he'd forgotten I lived here, too.<br><br>I grabbed a bagel from the top of the fridge and chewed it sullenly, keeping an eye on the clock. Beau, our German shepherd, wandered in and put his big head on my knee. I scratched him behind the ears and he groaned. At least the <em>dog </em>appreciated me.<br><br>Luke stood, gently placing Ethan back in his seat. "All right, big guy," he said, kissing the top of Ethan's head. "Dad has to fix the bathroom sink, so you sit there and be good. When I'm done, we'll go feed the pigs, okay?"<br><br>"'Kay," Ethan chirped, swinging his chubby legs. "Floppy wants to see if Ms. Daisy had her babies yet."<br><br>Luke's smile was so disgustingly proud, I felt nauseous.<br><br>"Hey, Luke," I said as he turned to go, "bet you can't guess what tomorrow is."<br><br>"Mmm?" He didn't even turn around. "I don't know, Meg. If you have plans for tomorrow, talk to your mother." He snapped his fingers, and Beau immediately left me to follow him. Their footsteps faded up the stairs, and I was alone with my half brother.<br><br>Ethan kicked his feet, regarding me in that solemn way of his. "I know," he announced softly, putting his Pop-Tart on the table. "Tomorrow's your birthday, isn't it? Floppy told me, and I remembered."<br><br>"Yeah," I muttered, turning and lobbing the bagel into the trash can. It hit the wall with a thump and dropped inside, leaving a greasy smear on the paint. I smirked and decided to leave it.<br><br>"Floppy says to tell you happy early birthday."<br><br>"Tell Floppy thanks." I ruffled Ethan's hair as I left the kitchen, my mood completely soured. I knew it. Mom and Luke would completely forget my birthday tomorrow. I wouldn't get a card, or a cake, or even a "happy birthday" from anyone. Except my kid brother's stupid stuffed rabbit. How pathetic was that?<br><br>Back in my room, I grabbed books, homework, gym clothes, and the iPod I'd spent a year saving for, despite Luke's disdain of those "useless, brain-numbing gadgets." In true hick fashion, my stepfather dislikes and distrusts anything that could make life easier. Cell phones? No way, we've got a perfectly good landline. Video games? They're the devil's tools, turning kids into delinquents and serial killers. I've begged Mom over and over to buy me a laptop for school, but Luke insists that if his ancient, clunky PC is good enough for him, it's good enough for the family. Never mind that dial-up takes flipping <em>forever. </em>I mean, who uses dial-up anymore?<br><br>I checked my watch and swore. The bus would arrive shortly, and I had a good ten-minute walk to the main road. Looking out the window, I saw the sky was gray and heavy with rain, so I grabbed a jacket, as well. And, not for the first time, I wished we lived closer to town.<br><br><em>I swear, when I get a license and a car, I am never coming back to this place.</em><br><br>"Meggie?" Ethan hovered in the doorway, clutching his rabbit under his chin. His blue eyes regarded me somberly. "Can I go with you today?"<br><br>"What?" Shrugging into my jacket, I gazed around for my backpack. "No, Ethan. I'm going to school now. Big-kids school, no rug rats allowed."<br><br>I turned away, only to feel two small arms wrap around my leg. Putting my hand against the wall to avoid falling, I glared down at my half brother. Ethan clung to me doggedly, his face tilted up to mine, his jaw set. "Please?" he begged. "I'll be good, I promise. Take me with you? Just for today?"<br><br>With a sigh, I bent down and picked him up.<br><br>"What's up, squirt?" I asked, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Mom would need to cut it soon; it was starting to look like a bird's nest. "You're awfully clingy this morning. What's going on?"<br><br>"Scared," Ethan muttered, burying his face in my neck.<br><br>"You're scared?"<br><br>He shook his head. "Floppy's scared."<br><br>"What's Floppy scared of?"<br><br>"The man in the closet."<br><br>I felt a small chill slide up my back. Sometimes, Ethan was so quiet and serious, it was hard to remember he was only four. He still had childish fears of monsters under his bed and bogeymen in his closet. In Ethan's world, stuffed animals spoke to him, invisible men waved to him from the bushes, and scary creatures tapped long nails against his bedroom window. He rarely went to Mom or Luke with stories of monsters and bogeymen; from the time he was old enough to walk, he always came to me.<br><br>I sighed, knowing he wanted me to go upstairs and check, to reassure him that nothing lurked in his closet or under his bed. I kept a flashlight on his dresser for that very reason.<br><br>Outside, lightning flickered, and thunder rumbled in the distance. I winced. My walk to the bus was not going to be pleasant.<br><br><em>Dammit, I don't have time for this.</em><br><br>Ethan pulled back and looked at me, eyes pleading. I sighed again. "Fine," I muttered, putting him down. "Let's go check for monsters."<br><br>He followed me silently up the stairs, watching anxiously as I grabbed the flashlight and got down on my knees, shining it under the bed. "No monsters there," I announced, standing up. I walked to the closet door and flung it open as Ethan peeked out from behind my legs. "No monsters here, either. Think you'll be all right now?"<br><br>He nodded and gave me a faint smile. I started to close the door when I noticed a strange gray hat in the corner. It was domed on top, with a circular rim and a red band around the base: a bowler hat.<br><br><em>Weird. Why would that be there?</em><br><br>As I straightened and started to turn around, something moved out of the corner of my eye. I caught a glimpse of a figure hiding behind Ethan's bedroom door, its pale eyes watching me through the crack. I jerked my head around, but of course there was nothing there.<br><br><em>Jeez, now Ethan's got </em>me <em>seeing imaginary monsters. I need to stop watching those late-night horror flicks.</em><br><br>A thunderous boom directly overhead made me jump, and fat drops plinked against the windowpanes. Rushing past Ethan, I burst out of the house and sprinted down the driveway.<br><br>I was soaked when I reached the bus stop. The late spring rain wasn't frigid, but it was cold enough to be uncomfortable. I crossed my arms and huddled under a mossy cypress, waiting for the bus to arrive.<br><br><em>Wonder where Robbie is? </em>I mused, gazing down the road. <em>He's usually here by now. Maybe he didn't fleel like getting drenched and stayed home. </em>I snorted and rolled my eyes. <em>Skipping class again, huh? Slacker. Wish I could do that.</em><br><br>If only I had a car. I knew kids whose parents gave <em>them </em>cars for their sixteenth birthday. Me, I'd be lucky if I got a cake. Most of my classmates already had licenses and could drive themselves to clubs and parties and anywhere they wanted. I was always left behind, the backward hick girl nobody wanted to invite.<br><br><em>Except Robbie, </em>I amended with a small mental shrug. <em>At least Robbie will remember. Wonder what kooky thing he has planned flor my birthday tomorrow? </em>I could almost guarantee it would be something strange or crazy. Last year, he snuck me out of the house for a midnight picnic in the woods. It was weird; I remembered the glen and the little pond with the fireflies drifting over it, but though I explored the woods behind my house countless times since then, I never found it again.<br><br>Something rustled in the bushes behind me. A possum or a deer, or even a fox, seeking shelter from the rain. The wildlife out here was stupidly bold and had little fear of humans. If it wasn't for Beau, Mom's vegetable garden would be a buffet for rabbits and deer, and the local raccoon family would help themselves to everything in our cupboards.<br><br>A branch snapped in the trees, closer this time. I shifted uncomfortably, determined not to turn around for some stupid squirrel or raccoon. I'm not like "inflate-a-boob" Angie, Ms. Perfect Cheerleader, who'd flip out if she saw a caged gerbil or a speck of dirt on her Hollister jeans. I've pitched hay and killed rats and driven pigs through knee-deep mud. Wild animals don't scare me.<br><br>Still, I stared down the road, hoping to see the bus turn the corner. Maybe it was the rain and my own sick imagination, but the woods felt like the set for <em>The Blair Witch Project.</em><br><br><em>There are no wolves or serial killers out here, </em>I told myself. <em>Stop being paranoid.</em><br><br></p><h2>Indian Killer</h2><p>While a serial killer stalks and scalps white men in Seattle, John Smith, an Indian adopted into a white family, becomes dissatisfied with his life, and, as the killer searches for his next victim, John descends into the madness of Seattle&#39;s homeless. 75,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Native American Sherman Alexie&#39;s new novel is a departure in tone from his lyrical and funny earlier work, which include The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven and Reservation Blues. The main character is an Indian serial killer who incites racial tension by murdering whites in retribution for his people&#39;s history. The killer leaves clear signs of his motives by scalping his victims, and leaving feathers as gestures of Indian defiance. The killer is a conflicted creation--raised by loving white parents, but twisted by loss of his identity as an Indian. Alexie layers the story with complications and ancillary characters, from a rabid talk show host, to vengeance seeking whites, to liberals who find their patronizing espousal of Indian causes no longer so easy.Sherman Alexie is a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian. He earned a 1994 Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writers' Award, was a citation winner for the PEN/Hemingway Award for the Best First Book of Fiction, and was named one of Granta's Best of the Young American Novelists. Alexie is the author of The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven , which served as the basis for a film that premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. His book Reservation Blues won him the Before Columbus Foundation's American Book Award.

Cain: Three Complete Novels: The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, and Mildred Pierce</h2><p>Three complete works by a best-selling author encompass themes of suspense, human lust, greed, and self-absorption, and include The Postman Always Rings Twice, Mildred Pierce, and Double Indemnity.</p><p></p><h2>Comrades: Brothers, Fathers, Heroes, Sons, Pals</h2><p>The author looks at his own friendships with his father and brothers, as well as friendships between other brothers, fellow soldiers, and colleagues</p><p>This tender book about male friendship will probably surprise those readers who know Stephen Ambrose best for his histories of World War II and biography of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Born in 1936, Ambrose acknowledges in the introduction to his memoir that men of his generation do not speak or write easily about their feelings. Yet male bonding is a strong theme in all of his work, as selections from previous writings on Lewis and Clark, Richard Nixon, Crazy Horse, and General Custer that are included in <i>Comrades</i> prove. What is more interesting, however, is the more personal material on Ambrose's two brothers (their youthful competitiveness mellowed into mature devotion), fellow historian Gordon Mueller ("my dearest and closest friend"), and several college buddies. After losing touch with each other during the harried years of career building and child rearing, these men rediscovered intimacy in middle age. Most moving of all is the closing chapter on Ambrose's father, an old-fashioned authority figure and disciplinarian quick to criticize his sons, but always available to sustain and guide them. The warming of that rather stern relationship is clearly one of the great joys of his son's adult life. It makes a fitting finale to a dignified but strikingly sweet memoir. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Stephen E.

Ms. Atwell lives in Maine.Kindergarten-Grade 3-After burning the Thanksgiving dinner, an elderly couple goes down the street to a restaurant. They wander in through the open door of the New World Caf&#x201a;, but the proprietor's family thinks that having customers will ruin their private party. Grandmother chastises them and so the "guests" are given the seats of honor. Soon, Ed and Ann join Papa, Grandmother, and the others in sharing their songs, dancing, and holiday warmth. As the family bids their new friends good evening, Papa wonders at the raw potato jammed under the door. Grandmother says, "In old country Thanksgiving door is like happy heart, opened up big and wide. Potato good for that." Atwell's luminous folk-art illustrations expand the story through details such as Russian onion domes in a picture on the wall, fur hats on the men, scarves on the women, and the cover illustration of Grandmother jamming that potato under the door. A particularly nice feature of this story is its focus on the elderly couple.

As her masters are torn between their own nationality and their somewhat reluctant new allegiance to the British colonial government, Zettie, too, must reconsider her own loyalties.</p><p>Grade 4-6-Zettie, 12, is a companion to the daughter of a once-wealthy Frenchman. An African slave, she was purchased as a gift for Marie-Louise and although well treated, she longs to be free. After Marie-Louise's father dies, her older brother threatens to sell the slaves and marry off his sister to an older, unattractive, but wealthy man to keep himself out of debtor's prison. Marie-Louise convinces her fiance to purchase Zettie as her wedding gift, and the two girls, with the help of a friend, flee to Spain, and then to America. They sail to a British-controlled fort in the area that would later become New York State. The rest of the book describes life at the fort, the effects of the French and Indian War on the relations with the Native Americans, and Marie-Louise's search for her younger brother, who had been captured by the Delaware Indians. The diary is a straightforward account with very little emotion. Zettie simply records the events of the day with few comments as to her thoughts and feelings, and her character is never fully developed. The other figures are even more shadowy. The quality of the black-and-white period maps, portraits, landscapes, etc., is poor. It is unfortunate that a book written about this time period, on which there is little fiction available for this age, is not up to the author's usual standard.<br><i>Nancy P.

Her mother died giving birth to her on a slave ship to France, and Lozette ("Zettie") grew up in France as companion and slave to upper-class Mary-Louise. Now at 12 she finds herself with her French mistress in New York Colony at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. Like other books in the Dear America series, this story is told as a fictionalized diary, and as usual, the blend of fact and fiction, which includes a contrived "epilogue," is confusing, especially as most middle-graders won't know much about this early colonial history. But McKissack does provide an immediate view of the period (including the horrifying decision to give the Indians blankets infected with smallpox), and the personal story brings a fresh perspective to issues of race and class. Compared with some of the poor white servants, Zettie is privileged. She can't do any household chores, but she can read, and she helps the soldiers write home. Her struggle to give up comfort and protection and find true independence is the most moving part of a story seldom told. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

On Lies, Secrets, and Silence is an extraordinary sort of travel diary, documenting Adrienne Rich&#39;s journeys to the frontier and into the interior. It traces the development of one individual consciousness, &#39;playing over such issues as motherhood, racism, history, poetry, the uses of scholarship, the politics of language.&#39; Rich has written a headnote for each essay, briefly discussing the circumstances of its writing.Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes a National Book Award for poetry for Tonight, No Poetry Will Serve, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant in 1994, and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for Diving Into the Wreck. That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s other volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2006, Rich was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.</p><h2>Roosevelt&#39;s Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage</h2><p>Despite all that has already been written on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Joseph Persico has uncovered a hitherto overlooked dimension of FDR's wartime leadership: his involvement in intelligence and espionage operations.<br><br><b>Roosevelt's Secret War</b> is crowded with remarkable revelations:<br>-FDR wanted to bomb Tokyo before Pearl Harbor<br>-A defector from Hitler's inner circle reported directly to the Oval Office<br>-Roosevelt knew before any other world leader of Hitler's plan to invade Russia<br>-Roosevelt and Churchill concealed a disaster costing hundreds of British soldiers' lives in order to protect Ultra, the British codebreaking secret<br>-An unwitting Japanese diplomat provided the President with a direct pipeline into Hitler's councils<br><b>Roosevelt's Secret War </b>also describes how much FDR had been told--before the Holocaust--about the coming fate of Europe's Jews. And Persico also provides a definitive answer to the perennial question Did FDR know in advance about the attack on Pearl Harbor?<br><br>By temperament and character, no American president was better suited for secret warfare than FDR. He manipulated, compartmentalized, dissembled, and misled, demonstrating a spymaster's talent for intrigue. He once remarked, "I never let my right hand know what my left hand does." Not only did Roosevelt create America's first central intelligence agency, the OSS, under "Wild Bill" Donovan, but he ran spy rings directly from the Oval Office, enlisting well-placed socialite friends. <br><br>FDR was also spied <i>against</i>. <b>Roosevelt's Secret War </b>presents evidence that the Soviet Union had a source inside the Roosevelt White House; that British agents fed FDR total fabrications to draw the United States into war; and that Roosevelt, by yielding to Churchill's demand that British scientists be allowed to work on the Manhattan Project, enabled the secrets of the bomb to be stolen. And these are only a few of the scores of revelations in this constantly surprising story of Roosevelt's hidden role in World War II.</p><p>Joseph E. Persico presents FDR as one of America's great spymasters. "Few leaders were better adapted temperamentally to espionage than Franklin Roosevelt," writes Persico, author of <i>Nuremberg</i> and Colin Powell's autobiographical collaborator. "FDR compartmentalized information, misled associates, manipulated people, conducted intrigues, used private lines of communication, scattered responsibility, duplicated assignments, provoked rivalries, held the cards while showing few, and left few fingerprints." He was a kind of principled Machiavellian who hoped to achieve several clear ends, such as getting the United States into the Second World War, even though most of the public wanted nothing to do with it (before Pearl Harbor). FDR then pursued these goals with the fervor of an opportunist: "the devious route to a desirable goal; inconstant behavior directed toward constant ends; the warship hiding behind a smoke screen but steered by a moral compass." <p> A good example of this is his relationship with the celebrated aviator Charles Lindbergh. Roosevelt asked J. Edgar Hoover to keep tabs on Lindbergh because he was a critic of the administration, and FDR suspected he was a closeted Nazi (not true, but perhaps an understandable opinion). <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i> reveals how FDR created a huge intelligence operation and then ran it--he "built espionage into the structure of American government," says Persico. There were plenty of successes (Roosevelt knew about Hitler's plans to invade Russia before they did it), but also failings: Soviet agents burrowed into FDR's administration at the highest levels. One of the best sections of the book addresses a perennial question: Did FDR know the Japanese were about to bomb Pearl Harbor and let them do it because he believed the sneak attack would propel the public into supporting war against the Axis powers? Persico argues that FDR didn't know: "The clues seem to lead to that conclusion like lights on a well-marked runway." He makes a convincing case that "Pearl Harbor was a catastrophe, not a conspiracy." <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i> is a unique contribution to our understanding of FDR--no other book treats America's longest-serving president as a spymaster--and it will appeal to readers interested in the Second World War and the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage. --<i>John Miller</i></p>Joseph E. Persico&#x2019;s books include <b>Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</b>, which was made into a major television docudrama, and <b>Piercing the Reich</b>, on the penetration of Nazi Germany by American agents.
